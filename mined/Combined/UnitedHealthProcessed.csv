Shares of the company, which was targeted by activist fund Elliott Management, rose 6.2 percent to $52.95 in morning trading on Tuesday. The company, which provides research and software tools as well as consulting services to healthcare and education firms, said it would sell its education business for $1.55 billion and its healthcare business for $1.3 billion, including debt. The sale of the education business is expected to close by the end of this year or in early 2018, after which Advisory Board will merge its healthcare unit with Optum, the company said. Insurer UnitedHealth’s Optum business, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, will also acquire Advisory Board’s equity interest in healthcare technology provider Evolent Health Inc. “It’s a smart, congruent and synergistic acquisition (for UnitedHealth),” Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick wrote in a note. The combined deal would give Advisory Board’s shareholders about $54.29 per share in cash, including a fixed amount of $52.65 per share and the after-tax value of its 7.6 percent stake in Evolent, at closing. Advisory Board said in February it would explore options, including a sale of part or the entire company, after activist fund Elliott Management said the company’s stock was “significantly undervalued”. Elliott had a nearly 5 percent stake in the company as of June 30, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Tuesday, Advisory Board said Elliott agreed to vote in favor of the deals. “Given that the company went through a detailed - and fairly lengthy - sales process, we do not believe that other bidders will emerge for the asset,” William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels said in a client note. Goldman Sachs & Co and Allen & Co were financial advisers to Advisory Board, while Skadden served as legal adviser. Evercore and Macquarie Capital were the financial advisers to Vista Equity Partners, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP was its legal adviser. ","

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said on Wednesday that only Paulding County in northwestern Ohio was projected to be a “bare county” with no insurers in 2018, while 1,478 counties could have only one issuer next year. Just a month ago, CMS said there were 40 counties projected to have no insurers next year. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty about healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seeks to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. But other insurers, like Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into new counties that had lost their coverage options. In June, Centene said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. ","

3, ,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s new gene-modifying cancer therapy’s $475,000-per-patient sticker price has drawn fire from advocate groups calling for cheaper drugs, but analysts said the Swiss drugmaker could initially struggle to break even. In a first for gene therapy in the United States, regulators approved Kymriah on Wednesday for patients up to 25 years of age who have relapsed or not been helped by previous treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While patient groups hailed the potent immunotherapy as a potential cancer game-changer, the Swiss drugmaker was also criticized for setting a price that places Kymriah among the most-expensive drugs ever. It trails only a couple of gene therapies for ulta-rare diseases. Since taxpayers have chipped in more than $200 million over the years for related research — much early work on the drug was done at the University of Pennsylvania — Novartis should have used more restraint, the Patients for Affordable Drugs lobby group said. “We believe it is excessive,” said David Mitchell, a cancer patient who founded the group. “Novartis should not get credit for bringing a $475,000 drug to market and claiming they could have charged people a lot more.” Novartis estimates that only 600 ALL patients a year would be eligible for Kymriah, making the initial pool for the treatment relatively scarce and worth less than $300 million. The company is also targeting the several thousand people a year who have relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) diagnosed, but it will not file Kymriah for that group until later this year. BREAK-EVEN POINT? Success with those patients is key to Novartis turning Kymriah into the $1 billion-a-year blockbuster drug the Swiss company predicts it will eventually become, but analysts say it is anyone’s guess when it will start covering its costs. “It is not clear what the break-even point for profitability is, as this is a very capital intensive endeavor,” said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, adding that Novartis is likely to cut the price of Kymriah for DLBCL patients. On Thursday Novartis said that its cost of goods per Kymriah treatment is confidential commercial information, but analysts estimate it could be as high as $200,000. The process is complex. Doctors remove T cells from each cancer victim and ship the material to its factory in Morris Plains, New Jersey. After re-engineering them to attack cancer, frozen cells are returned a couple weeks later for reinfusion into patients. Additionally, Novartis partner Oxford BioMedica, which supplies a key ingredient, may be due $100 million over the next three years, plus royalties on sales. Furthermore, competition is on the horizon. Gilead Sciences this week announced an $11.9 billion deal to buy Kite Pharma to gain access to a similar drug, while Bluebird Bio and Juno Therapeutics are all working on their own CAR-T therapies. While Kymriah’s price tag will grab headlines, it pales in comparison with some other gene therapy treatments. For instance, UniQure’s Glybera, for a very rare blood disorder, runs at about $1 million per patient. Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline’s Strimvelis, for so-called “bubble boy” disease, comes in at about $700,000 per patient. Novartis points out that some groups think the company could actually have charged more for Kymriah. British health authorities, for instance, had said that up to $650,000 might have been justified if the treatment added years to children’s lives. Novartis plans to charge insurers and payers only when the drug proves to be effective one month into treatment, a so-called “outcome-based” pricing scheme that puts some of the risk of the drug on its manufacturer. Even so, analysts hardly expect that to shield Novartis from criticism. “Expect turbulent public discussions on drug pricing, demonstrating that the road to hell is paved with good intentions,” said Bruno Bulic of equity research firm Baader Helvea. Bulic forecasts that Kymriah will start adding to Novartis’s bottom line only after 2019, when it is expected to be given to more patient groups. ","

4, ,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has been investigating how Bloomberg Philanthropies, founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, funds local non-profit groups for anti-tobacco lobbying, government documents show, making it the latest foreign non-government organization to come under scrutiny. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has since 2014 tightened surveillance of non-profit groups, saying they were acting against India’s national interests. Thousands of foreign-funded charities’ licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations. Critics, however, say the government has used the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India’s rapid economic development. The intelligence wing of India’s home ministry last year drafted a note on Bloomberg Philanthropies, raising concerns that the foundation was running a campaign to “target” Indian tobacco businesses and “aggressively” lobby against the sector. Though the three-page note, reviewed by Reuters, said the Bloomberg initiative’s “claimed intention to free India of tobacco cannot be faulted” given the known risks from tobacco, it highlighted the sector’s importance, noting it brings in nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for governments, and provides a livelihood for millions of people. “Foreign interests making foreign contributions ... for purposes of lobbying against an established economic activity raises multiple concerns,” the note said, including, it said, an “adverse economic impact” on 35 million people. The June 3, 2016 note, marked “SECRET” and circulated to top government officials, including in Modi’s office, has not previously been reported. The probe continued until at least April this year, another government document showed. Rebecca Carriero, a spokeswoman for Michael Bloomberg and New York-based Bloomberg Philanthropies, declined to comment as they were unaware of any investigation. A home ministry spokesman said “queries which relate to security agencies cannot be answered.” Modi’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment. The ministry’s note was one of the factors behind the rejection of a foreign funding license renewal of at least one Bloomberg-funded India charity last October, said a senior government official aware of the investigation. Michael Bloomberg, one of the world’s richest people and a former New York City Mayor, has committed nearly $1 billion to support global tobacco control efforts. One of his focus countries is India, where tobacco kills 900,000 people a year. Other than funding Indian NGOs, Bloomberg’s charity has in the past worked on improving road safety and supported federal tobacco-control efforts. In 2015, Modi called Michael Bloomberg a “friend”, and the two agreed on working together on India’s ambitious plan to build so-called smart cities. The home ministry note said the Bloomberg charity successfully lobbied for the introduction of bigger health warnings on cigarette packs, “contrary” to the recommendations of a parliamentary panel. While the panel called for the size of warnings to be more than doubled to 50 percent of a pack’s surface area, the health ministry sought a higher figure of 85 percent. Despite protests from India’s $10 billion cigarette industry, the Supreme Court last year ordered manufacturers to follow the more stringent health ministry rules. That, the note said, was the first of the three-phase Bloomberg campaign targeting India’s tobacco industry. It did not explain how exactly the Bloomberg charity lobbied. While the note mirrored some of India’s tobacco lobby’s positions - such as how anti-smoking policies could adversely impact farmers - the government official said the investigation was not done at the behest of the industry. “Anti-tobacco lobby wants to kill revenue generating activities,” the official said. A health ministry official, however, said: “We don’t see tobacco as an economic activity.” He added that the health ministry was unaware of the home ministry’s note on Bloomberg Philanthropies. India has stepped up scrutiny of NGOs registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). In 2015, the home ministry put the Ford Foundation on a watch list and suspended Greenpeace India’s FCRA license, drawing criticism from the United States. Earlier this year, the government banned foreign funding for the Public Health Foundation of India, a group backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, saying it used foreign donations to “lobby” for tobacco-control policy issues, “which is prohibited under FCRA.” In the Bloomberg case, the home ministry note included a chart showing how funds flowed from Bloomberg Philanthropies to its partner, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which was then funding five local FCRA-registered NGOs. These NGOs, the note said, were being used by the Bloomberg charity for “anti-tobacco lobbying activities.” The FCRA license of at least one of them - the Institute of Public Health (IPH) Bengaluru - was not renewed in October, in part due to the home ministry’s note, the government official said. The IPH said it was told by the home ministry that its license was not being renewed on the basis of a “field agency report”, but no details were given. It was unaware of the investigation on Bloomberg Philanthropies. In April, the home ministry wrote to the federal health ministry, citing an “inquiry into foreign funding” for lobbying to change laws in India. The letter, seen by Reuters, mentioned the Bloomberg initiative and directed the health ministry to report on anti-tobacco lobbying by foreign donors in other countries where tobacco is widely used. The health ministry has not yet sent that report, another government official said. The health ministry did not respond to questions.

5, ,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - As an influx of asylum seekers crossing from the United States strains Canada’s immigration system, the country is ramping up its deportation of migrants, government data shows. Deportations of Mexicans, who have flocked to Canada in growing numbers after a visa requirement was lifted in December, was already 66 percent higher in the first eight months of 2017 than the total from the previous year. Deportations of Haitians, thousands of whom have crossed into Canada illegally in the hopes of avoiding deportation from the United States, have also soared. Canada has deported 474 so far this year, compared to 100 for all of 2016 when the government lifted its own ban on deportations to Haiti, in place since a devastating 2010 earthquake. Overall, 5,529 people have been deported as of Tuesday, compared to 7,357 for all of 2016, the data shows. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board has called a rise in asylum-seekers through the U.S. border “unsustainable,” and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, fretting about another big surge in asylum claims, has been trying to warn people away. At the same time, Canada said this week it will be granting border-crossing asylum seekers swifter access to healthcare. They will also be eligible for work permits sooner. Refugee claimants are eligible for health coverage and work permits once their claims are processed, but that can take weeks or months. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have walked across the U.S. border into Canada to file refugee claims so far this year, including 3,800 into Quebec in the first two weeks of August alone, authorities have said. Canada is on track to record the most refugee claims in a decade. ","

6, ,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan are moving more aggressively to protect civilians caught in the country’s four-year civil war, after years of criticism for failures that led to the sacking of the mission’s military chief last year. This year, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has rescued aid workers and U.N. staff during attacks, saved civilians from abduction by armed groups, and pushed past roadblocks to a massacre site. “A lot has been done ... to improve UNMISS’ ability to deliver on its protection of civilians mandate,” said Lauren Spink, a South Sudan specialist for the independent U.S.-based advocacy group Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC). South Sudan was the world’s youngest country when it became independent from neighbouring Sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict. But the new nation dissolved into civil war less than two years later, after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Since then tens of thousands have died, and 3.5 million of the country’s 12 million citizens have fled their homes, creating Africa’s largest refugee crisis since Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. As the war spread, families flooded into U.N. bases seeking protection. More than 210,000 people now stay in six such bases, too fearful to go home. Between December 2013 and July 2016, more than 100 civilians and four U.N. peacekeepers were killed in attacks on U.N. bases when peacekeepers didn’t shoot back, fled, or delayed responding, according to data from the U.N. and CIVIC. But a chastened UNMISS has gradually taken a tougher stance, boosted by the January arrival of new chief David Shearer, a former New Zealand labour party leader. “We are trying to make our peacekeeping more robust,” Shearer told Reuters. “Our peacekeepers are going to stand up to situations and challenge them.” Several incidents demonstrate the change. In April, peacekeepers deployed to Aburoc, a village on the Nile. After the U.N. arrived, rebels withdrew, and a government offensive that had displaced 20,000 civilians paused. Aid workers then intervened to stop a cholera outbreak. The same month, peacekeepers went to Torit in the southeast to protect an orphanage housing 250 children caught between the front lines. Mongolian peacekeepers in northern Bentiu town have repeatedly rescued civilians from abduction by armed groups this year, including one incident where they fired their weapons. Reuters was unable to find records of such interventions for previous years. “There is improvement,” said Peter Ruach, who lives in the camp outside the U.N. base in Juba. A year ago government troops raped dozens of women who ventured outside the fence to search for food. “The Ethiopian battalion have cleared a buffer zone and they make sure that when women are going out for collection of firewood they are protected,” he said. Since the buffer zone opened at the end of November, serious crimes like rape and murder reported near the camp had dropped from around 48 per month to between 1 and 5, the U.N. said. U.N. peacekeepers have been in South Sudan since before independence, but found themselves frequently criticised after war broke out by aid groups like Doctors Without Borders, who said they were not doing enough to protect civilians. A year ago, peacekeepers at the U.N.’s main Juba base ignored desperate pleas for help when government troops attacked a hotel a mile away, killing one aid worker and gang-raping others. In following days, government troops raped dozens of Nuer women outside the same base. Ten aid agencies released a joint statement accusing peacekeepers of failing to adequately patrol the area. “The inability of UNMISS to protect civilians threatens to undermine any attempts at safety and security in the country and makes it impossible for humanitarian agencies to provide the help that is so urgently needed,” Frederick McCray, South Sudan Country Director at charity CARE, said at the time. The U.N. eventually launched an investigation that led to the firing of UNMISS’ top general, Kenya’s Johnson Ondieki, in November. In response, Kenya pulled its troops from the peacekeeping mission. Despite more robust peacekeeping, the violence continues. The mission has 12,000 armed peacekeepers and a budget of over a billion dollars. But that’s not enough to patrol a nation the size of France with under 300 km (185 miles) of paved roads. Peacekeepers were too stretched to deploy to Pagak, a rebel stronghold in the northeast, where a government offensive has displaced thousands and forced dozens of aid workers to evacuate since July, Shearer said. U.N. patrols did not intervene in the northwestern town of Wau in April when a government-aligned Dinka militia went door-to-door, executing at least 16 people of other ethnicities. Part of the problem is that the U.N. needs permission from South Sudan’s government for its presence. That can interfere with investigations or interventions aimed at government forces. Last week, the government grounded U.N. flights after a dispute about the deployment of an additional 4,000 troops to beef up the peacekeeping mission. The government is reluctant to accept the new force. “The U.N. cannot be totally independent in a country that is sovereign. They need to be working in cooperation with the government ... They cannot run a parallel government,” said presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. He denied that government forces had killed or abused civilians. “Government ... cannot do anything harmful to civilians that requires someone to come and protect them,” Ateny said. Shearer has responded to some roadblocks with public pressure. He took to U.N. radio to demand access to the Torit orphanage, and has ordered peacekeepers to hold their ground when their patrols are blocked by troops. “We’ve had several instances of platoons sleeping at checkpoints for up to three days until they were finally persistent enough to be allowed to go,” he said. But for some, U.N. intervention came too late. The U.N. did not arrive in Aburoc until April, well after the government offensive began in January. In the meantime, government forces killed civilians, bombing and shelling the area, and burning people alive in their homes, rights body Amnesty International said. ","

7, ,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"The move, announced on Thursday, follows the company’s $49 billion takeover of U.S. peer Reynolds American, which added Camel cigarettes and Vuse e-cigarettes to a BAT portfolio that includes Lucky Strike cigarettes, Vype e-cigarettes and the glo tobacco-heating device. “Now that we have built a successful NGP (next generation products) business which is poised for substantial growth, we will be fully integrating NGP to leverage the scale and expertise of the whole group to drive growth in an area that is fast becoming a key part of our mainstream business,” BAT said in a statement. BAT and Philip Morris were the first of the big tobacco firms to invest in cigarette alternatives a few year back, as growing health consciousness reduces traditional smoking. Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, is ahead of BAT in the market for tobacco-based vaping devices, which some analysts believe will be more popular than traditional e-cigarettes with regular smokers, and its shares have been at a bigger premium to its peers. (bit.ly/2xOLU9R) Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed cutting nicotine in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels in a push to move smokers toward potentially less harmful e-cigarettes. Under the management reorganization announced on Thursday BAT appointed Asia-Pacific Director Jack Bowles to the newly created role of chief operating officer for the international business, excluding the United States. Shares were up around 1.5 percent at 1322 GMT on Thursday. Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said the changes could add some uncertainty for BAT in the near term, but in the longer term it reinforced the importance of cigarette alternatives to tobacco companies, which face slowing sales globally. “Whereas those companies that were better positioned for emerging market growth in the past were favoured, the key differentiator now is likely to be who is positioned best in emerging products, given the recent slowdown in emerging market cigarettes,” the analyst said. Japan Tobacco said last week it would buy the Philippines’ No. 2 cigarette maker Mighty Corp for about $936 million, its second large deal in Southeast Asia this month, as it deepens its push into emerging markets.

The outbreak in the city of Maiduguri, the epicenter of the fight against the Islamist insurgents, confirms aid groups’ fears that Nigeria’s rainy season could spread disease in camps for the internally displaced that are often already unsanitary. About 1.8 million have abandoned their homes because of violence or food shortages, U.N. agencies say, and many of them live in camps for the displaced throughout northeast Nigeria, particularly in Maiduguri and the surrounding state of Borno. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, is increasing its “efforts to prevent further deaths and the spread of cholera in Maiduguri”, the group said. MSF said it had set up a 40-bed cholera treatment unit, which has admitted 70 patients, mostly from the Muna Garage camp. “Following heavy rains, the camp is partly flooded, making the already poor sanitary conditions at the camp even worse, which is an additional risk factor during a cholera outbreak,” MSF said, adding that a potential case has been reported from another part of Maiduguri. “Since last weekend, we have witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients at our treatment center and at the rehydration point in Muna camp,” said Anne-Cecile Niard, MSF project coordinator in the statement. “We are worried that the number of beds that are currently planned will not be enough to cope at the peak of the outbreak.” More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, and 5.2 million people in the northeast do not have secure access to food, with tens of thousands already in famine-like conditions, according to the United Nations.

Demand for electric cars depends on a network of charging points, which utilities, engineering groups, automakers and start-ups are vying to provide and control before the sector takes off. Founded in 2007, Silicon Valley-based ChargePoint operates about 40,000 charging spots in the United States and Mexico. It sells the stations to service providers and hooks them up to its network that can be accessed via a smartphone app. It has so far raised nearly $300 million in funds, with Daimler and Siemens becoming investors this year. BMW first supplied funds in 2012, according to Crunchbase data. “We will probably look to be public within the next five years,” Pasquale Romano said in an interview, adding the group was preparing to implement a reporting structure to comply with stock market requirements. “We’ll be ready. But the conditions have to be right.” ChargePoint does not disclose its ownership structure, but Romano said that Daimler, BMW and Siemens together hold a significant stake. Its owners also include venture capital firms Linse Capital, Rho Capital Partners and Braemar Energy Ventures. “Europe is starting with a stronger political mandate,” Romano said, adding ChargePoint was hiring “furiously” in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Britain, where it struck a deal to sell fast chargers in May, its first in Europe. Europe, however, is also a highly fragmented market, with differing e-mobility legislation and support schemes across various countries, requiring a specific strategy and business model for almost every market. “The market will consolidate around three to four players and we hope to be one of them. That’s how we look at it,” Romano said, adding it was important to expand aggressively, possibly at the expense of immediate profitability. One potential business target could be a car consortium - which includes Daimler and BMW - aiming to install 400 super-fast charging stations across Europe. “Of course, we can help that consortium with our technology,” Romano said.

Part of this is explained by the compliance risks investment banks face, as painting too specific or too rosy a picture can be perceived as misleading. Another possible explanation is that private equity associates are much more likely to have ""skin in the game,"" so to speak. With their own capital on the line, and less patient clientele, private equity analysts often dig deeper and more critically. Colloquial tales of a private equity associate lifestyle appear to be much more forgiving and balanced than their counterparts in investment banking. The strict, suit-and-tie, 14-hour and high-stress corporate culture popularized in movies and television reflects investment banking culture. Private equity firms are usually smaller and more selective about their employees. But once a hire is made, they care less about how performance is maintained. There are exceptions and overlaps in every industry but, in general, the average day is a bit less stressful for private equity associates.

14,Christina Farr,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"Health insurer Aetna has hired Ben Wanamaker from Wal-Mart's health division to lead its joint venture with Apple, according to sources familiar with the matter. At Wal-Mart, Wanamaker's role involved leading business development and strategy for the company's health, wellness and e-commerce businesses, with a focus on partnerships. Wanamaker's LinkedIn page still lists Wanamaker as a current employee of Wal-Mart. As CNBC reported last month, the Apple/Aetna venture is picking up steam. Representatives from both companies met earlier this month to discuss plans to provide free or discounted Apple smartwatches to Aetna's multimillion-strong member base. That presents a big sales opportunity for Apple's smartwatch, especially if other major health insurers follow suit. That partnership was  first announced in the fall of 2016. At that time, Aetna said it would be the first health care company to subsidize the cost of Apple Watch via monthly payroll deductions. Apple and Aetna's joint venture focuses on Apple Watch, which includes health and fitness as a primary use case. Apple Watch lets its users set workout goals, track steps and other metrics, as well as monitor their heart rate. There's a big opportunity for Apple and other makers of fitness trackers to provide them to enterprises, not just consumers. HR departments across the country see opportunities to leverage activity trackers and smartwatches to improve their members' overall health. Payers, including self-insured employers and insurers, are looking for ways to boost wellness to prevent their members from getting costly conditions, like heart disease and diabetes. Wal-Mart's health care offerings include online tools for anyone to search for a health insurance plan or buy supplies for a medical cabinet. It also has a pharmacy business.

15,Barbara Booth,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"For the first time, a study on internet addiction is being funded by The National Institutes of Health, a signal that the problems stemming from excessive internet use may finally be getting the serious attention it deserves from the U.S. mental health community. The two-year study kicks off this week and is being conducted at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. It may ultimately help to determine whether internet addiction, specifically online gaming, should be listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — widely known as the DSM-5 — as a true mental health disorder. The lead investigator of the study, Dr. Nancy Petry, also happens to be part of the American Psychiatric Association Workgroup on Substance Use and Related Disorders for the DSM-5 and chaired the subcommittee on non-substance-use addictive disorders. According to her, in 2013, when the DSM-5 was last published, there ""wasn't sufficient evidence to conclude that internet gaming addiction is a condition that can be reliably or accurately ascertained in people."" There still isn't, she says, but this new study may provide the data necessary to move internet gaming addiction, currently listed in the appendix of the DSM as a ""condition that needs further research,"" into the main manual as an official disorder — providing sufferers the possibility of one day being insured for treatment. ""Having something listed as a disorder affects reimbursement in this country. That's a huge thing,"" Dr. Petry told CNBC. ""A lot of people have developed such severe problems with gaming,"" she said. ""They stay up all day and game for 24 hours, and there is evidence that they are dropping out of school; they are losing their jobs; they are losing their families."" She adds that those with gaming addictions are primarily male and have co-morbidities, such as ADHD. Many other countries — including Australia, China, Japan, India, Italy, Japan, Korea and Taiwan—  already officially recognize tech addiction as a disorder, some even going so far as to declare the issue a public health crisis, leading governments and health-care providers to develop a series of major initiatives to curb the problem. But the discrepancies in the numbers of gamers diagnosed with addiction across the countries have spurred much debate over the accuracy of the criteria being used. According to Dr. Petry, the grant from the NIH — $416,694 — was ""a major coup,"" because other institutes refuse to recognize gaming addiction as a condition and therefore decline to fund it. But this isn't the first time Dr. Petry has fought for funding and won: She also headed the first-ever NIH study for gambling addiction. The study for internet gaming disorder focuses on cognitive behavioral treatments and will examine adolescents ages 13 to 18 who have a significant problem with gaming and are still living at home. This is the age most known to show signs of problematic gaming, Dr. Petry says. Official enrollment is now under way. The randomized controlled study will refer half the group to widely available treatments in their community for a co-occurring disorder; the other group will receive a six-session intervention from the APA as well as the treatment for the co-occurring disorder. Afterward the results will be compared. Dr. Petry claims that the debate surrounding whether or not gaming addiction should be classified as a disorder lies in the fact that this is ""a new phenomenon and everybody is measuring it in different ways."" She says people aren't quite clear on what the constricts are. ""We need to be consistent in defining these criteria and determine if they lead to significant harms before we blanketly label something as a disorder,"" she says. Dr. Petry believes the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5 for internet gaming disorder is ""reliable and accurate."" These include preoccupation with internet gaming, withdrawal symptoms, unsuccessful attempts to quit playing, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, continuing to play despite problems, deceiving others about the amount of time spent on gaming, using gaming to relieve negative moods and jeopardizing or losing a job due to gaming. If a person exhibits five or more of the symptoms, they could potentially be diagnosed as having internet gaming disorder. Many mental health experts argue, however, that excessive use of the internet extends to more than just gaming; sexting and porn addiction, online infidelity, online gambling, social media addiction, information overload and screen addiction are destroying millions of lives as well —and costing corporate America billions. According to a recent study by Vault.com, surfing costs $54 billion annually in lost productivity. As there is no standard criteria for diagnosis, especially between countries, it is impossible to put a number on the actual number of people who suffer from digital overuse, but surveys in the United States and Europe have indicated that it ranges between 1.5 and 8.2 percent of the population. Yet not everyone is buying into it. ""Tech addiction is a hot topic and one that people talk about a lot, but we need to clearly define and differentiate what constitutes a mental disorder that is causing major adverse consequences and distinguish it from just a bad habit that people just wish they weren't doing,"" Dr. Petry says. Disorder or not, scientists have determined that excessive internet use adversely affects the brain's frontal lobe and brainstem functions, resulting in delayed cognitive development—the ability to focus, speak, reason and comprehend social cues. Ultimately, internet addiction can cause anxiety and depression, ADHD, stress, obesity and the inability to interact in the real world, leading to personal, family, academic, financial and occupational problems. And medical experts say it's steadily going to get worse as technology gets faster and smarter, fueling the need for this ""digital heroine."" Like alcohol and drugs, the internet provides a high, and addicts become dependent on it for pleasure, claims Dr. David Greenfield, founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction in West Hartford, Connecticut, one of the first tech addiction centers to open in the United States. More from Modern Medicine: Doctors on cusp of launching male contraceptive need to seduce Big Pharma
FDA testing groundbreaking science: Human organs-on-a-chipHuge ER bills leave patients in shock An assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Dr. Greenfield is considered a pioneer in treating digital media overuse. His book, Virtual Addiction, rang an early warning bell when it came out in 1999, when the internet was still being accessed only through dial-up. ""There was no high-speed internet, no Wi-Fi, no laptops or tablets, no smartphones, and it was already an issue,"" he said. ""But now, because we have greater ease of access and it's easier to pick and click and have that automatic intoxication of response, it's more addictive."" Dr. Greenfield claims that this has led to an explosion of internet and tech abuse and addiction. ""The numbers of referral and patients that we get calls from has probably gone up 10-fold in the last 20 years. We have had a 1,000 percent increase in the numbers of cases, and we treat hundreds of cases a year at this point."" To meet the demand, hundreds of outpatient treatment centers are popping up all over the country, offering weekly intensives, digital-detox retreats and wilderness therapy. Dr. Greenfield's center will soon be adding a 30- to 60-day residential recovery program—the fourth in the United States to offer residential treatment. The others are reSTART, in Seattle; the Internet Addiction Treatment and Recovery Program at the Bradford Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania; and the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery in Peoria, Illinois. The cost of these programs: anywhere from $3,000 to $45,000, depending on length of stay and whether the recovery program involves residential or outpatient treatment. 5 tips to keep your child from becoming addicted to tech 1. Let your actions speak louder than your words. Lead by example and make face-to-face interaction more important than being on your smartphone. 2. Explain how biomechanics affect your brain and your body. Have an open and honest conversation with your kids about how these devices can affect them physically and mentally may put the brakes on. 3. Set limits on screen time. This is the most obvious step but perhaps the most difficult to enforce, says Bark. ""You can't just give your child a device and think they will turn it off when it's reasonable. We have to be parents. Take away the chargers. Use screen-time management apps."" Bark recommends Circle, Luma or Unglue. 4. Have screen-free zones in your house. Don't let your kids take their devices into their bedroom. Limit it to common areas. 5. Indulge in the real world. As a family, embrace art and music and cooking. Get outside, put your feet in the grass and experience the world."" While it may appear that the United States is gearing up to provide some much-needed intervention for this growing issue, their efforts pale in comparison to other countries. Globally, internet addiction has been receiving widespread attention, as are resources for people seeking treatment. In South Korea, China and Japan, where internet gaming is a major industry, tech addiction is considered a public health crisis. The South Korean government sponsors about 200 counseling centers and hospitals with programs on internet addiction and has trained more than 1,000 counselors. In 2013 the Ministry of Education in Japan introduced internet ""fasting camps"" for young addicts to receive counseling in a tech-free environment. China has more than 300 treatment centers (China officials there estimate 10 million teenagers are addicted). Insurance, says Dr. Petry, is largely to blame. In the United States, almost all clients have to pay out of pocket, as the centers can't bill health insurance companies for internet addiction treatment, since it hasn't been recognized in the DSM as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. And all three of the treatment centers are expensive; reSTART, for example, costs around $25,000 for the first month and $8,500 for a month of outpatient treatment. Yet Dr. Petry is optimistic things will shift. ""There's so much work going on with this right now—not in the U.S. but in Southeast Asia and Europe. By the time the next DSM is published, the data will be available."" And should online gaming addiction be designated as a mental health disorder, she says, other tech addictions may follow suit.

16,Elizabeth Gurdus,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"CNBC's Jim Cramer has been known to take fantasy football way too seriously, and on Thursday, he took it to the next level. ""It's time for me to show my reality, not fantasy, but reality stock team, the one I drafted in my head last night while I was busily putting together what could be a championship Skidaddy Ski team, which, of course, competes in the Mad Money Schlumpadicka league,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Even though Cramer wouldn't dare draft a quarterback first unless he was picking Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, he began with his stock market equivalent: Apple. ""If there's a rap against Brady, it's that he's an immobile passer. The rap against Apple is that it's just mobile. I look at Apple as the greatest consumer products company of all time, just as I look at Brady as the greatest quarterback of all time,"" Cramer said. Then, Cramer went for fleet-footed players, the market equivalents of six-foot-five wide receivers who aren't afraid of some traffic. He chose the stocks of Amazon, Netflix and Nvidia. Cramer said that Amazon is a winner in a number of ways — a flex play — with Amazon Web Services consistently delivering points and the retail business bringing the heat. ""I keep waiting for another player to have an answer to Amazon. There isn't one,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host pegged Netflix as the ""Odell Beckham Jr. of companies"" because it easily makes one-handed catches and each production ends up as a touchdown. ""Classic, value-oriented investors don't like the style of Netflix; too unorthodox, too showboat. But I don't care how a player acts off the field. Netflix is on a whole 'nother plane, a winner which consistently breaks out when you least expect it to,"" Cramer said. His last wide receiver would be Nvidia, a red-hot semiconductor stock with ties to the video game industry, autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and voice technology. ""It's tough to keep Nvidia down,"" Cramer said, pointing to the stock's bounce after what Wall Street saw as a weaker-than-expected quarter. ""Like all great receivers, Nvidia's shaken off the drop and is headed back toward an all-time high."" Alphabet and Facebook were Cramer's choices for running backs because even though their stocks seem overvalued, investors won't regret paying those prices later, he said. Despite Alphabet's recent struggles, Cramer said there was still hope for its stock to break out and urged investors not to give up on the opportunity to buy shares of the Google parent. ""Facebook's a stud. I don't even know if there's an analogue in the NFL as I've never seen anything like this company,"" Cramer said. ""Facebook's one of those backs that gets all-purpose yards for doing nothing but being a platform for two billion people. No NFL player has ever had that kind of pull."" Cramer chose Boeing, the strongest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial average, as his defense play because the aerospace giant simply won't quit. For a tight end, the ""Mad Money"" host went with UnitedHealth. ""Why UNH? Because great tight ends not only catch, they block,"" he said. ""I think that Optum, its amazing data business, is the authority on catching — what's flawed in the system, that is — and nobody blocks wasteful costs like UnitedHealth. They should call UNH 'Gronk.' Got me?"" Cramer's kicker draft was the stock of Visa, a financial technology company that he said is the most consistent of any of its competitors. And for his bench, he'd have Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba as a back-up quarterback, and stocks like Celgene, Autodesk, 3M or Honeywell as additional flex players. ""As you can see, this is a team that's built for the ages, not just built for the season. Yes, it's a bullish team, I acknowledge that. It's not as defensive as some would like. You can keep some cash on the sidelines for a decline,"" Cramer said. ""But if you wanted a playoff-ready team of stocks, it is this one, and it's seasoned, it's ready, it's stacked, it's loaded and it's in total beast mode."" Questions for Cramer?

17,Elizabeth Schulze,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"Europeans have a reputation for taking extra long holidays during summer. In Norway, the term ""fellesferie"" refers to two or three weeks of vacation time workers collectively take in July — leaving businesses closed or operating on summer hours. In the Netherlands, employees in the building industry take construction holidays called ""bouwvak"" for several weeks. And until two years ago in France, a law required Parisian bakers to stagger their summer vacation time so enough bakeries stayed open for customers during the holidays. It's an envious concept to many Americans — the United States is the only counry in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that does not mandate paid vacation. Research shows many Americans who receive paid time off are afraid to take it because of workplace pressures. But it turns out the European vacation mindset could actually help boost productivity. The European Union's Working Time Directive guarantees EU workers at least 20 paid vacation days per year, contrary to the United States, which does not have a statutory minimum annual leave requirement. Some European countries mandate additional time off: The U.K., France, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden all require 25 or more paid annual leave days, according to the OECD. Data show more time off doesn't have to translate into lower productivity. Nine of the top 10 most productive countries in the OECD in 2015, measured by GDP per hour worked, were in Europe. The United States ranked sixth. Katie Denis, VP and lead researcher at Project: Time Off, a research group funded by the U.S. Travel Association, has studied the effects of vacation on the workplace for several years. ""The idea that we're sacrificing this time off to get ahead, we're not actually finding that's true,"" Denis said. A 2016 report from the project found workers who took 11 or more vacation days were more likely to have received a raise or a bonus in the previous three years than workers who took 10 or fewer days. Time away from the office can also spark creativity. The ideas for major businesses, like Instagram, or the musical ""Hamilton,"" were inspired on vacation. ""The productivity, creativity, bringing new ideas forward isn't the person who's working crazy hours,"" Denis said. ""It's someone who's getting outside of their day-to-day."" Studies also find health benefits from taking vacation time, like lower stress, better mental health and even less likelihood of a heart attack. ""Vacations are important because they not only replenish the mind, they also reduce the physical effects of stress on the body,"" said Kathleen Potempa, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. Workload stress is a top barrier to taking vacation, according to Project: Time Off's 2017 State of American Vacation report. The survey of more than 7,000 Americans found 43 percent of workers did not take time off because they feared returning to a mountain of work. Cost was also a factor, with 32 percent saying they cannot financially afford a vacation. But experts say short and frequent breaks away from the office can still have a big impact on productivity. Many studies recommend taking vacation twice a year to improve health benefits, Potempa said. Potempa added that it's important for workers to unplug from work when they're on vacation. A June survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs research found one-third of Americans work or check in with work on vacation. ""The most important thing is that it becomes regular and you don't start skipping,"" she said. ""The major negative effects have been shown for people who don't take vacation for several years.""

18,"Leslie Kramer, special to CNBC.com",8312017,CNBC,8242017,"One third of Americans may be on their way to developing full-blown type 2 diabetes, and most of them don't even know it. A recent report from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that more than 84 million Americans, or roughly one-third of the population, have prediabetes, a condition marked by higher-than-normal blood sugar. Of that group, 90 percent aren't aware they have the condition. The primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes are genetics and lifestyle — excess weight, obesity and lack of exercise contribute to this alarming medical trend. ""People with prediabetes who don't change their lifestyle are at a much higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke and can develop type 2 diabetes within five years if left untreated,"" said William T. Cefalu, MD, chief scientific, medical & mission officer of the American Diabetes Association. The health risks go beyond heart disease and stroke. As diabetes worsens over time, blindness, kidney disease and lower-limb amputation are also major health risks. Diabetes was the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States in 2015, according to the CDC. This population of diabetes ""ticking time bombs"" is particularly alarming, because in many cases type 2 diabetes can be avoided, simply by leading a healthy lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes is often progressive, and within 10 years of diagnosis, 50 percent of individuals need to use insulin to control their blood glucose levels, according to the ADA. More than 30 million Americans — 9.4 percent of the U.S. population — are already battling diabetes, according to the CDC's National Diabetes Statistics Report, which used data through 2015. The CDC found that of those cases, 7.2 million were undiagnosed. ""The country needs to take this seriously, ratchet it up and make it a priority,"" said Ann Albright, PhD, RD, director of CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation. ""Far too few people know about it or know they have it, and that is why we launched the prevention program and joined forces with other organizations,"" she said. ""It requires us all to take this condition seriously."" Prediabetes is a condition in which a person's blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Doctors often refer to prediabetes as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), depending on which test they used to detect the condition. The A1C test is the most commonly used to detect the condition, because it is a blood test that provides information about a person's average blood glucose levels over the past 90 days. To be prediabetic, an individual would have to have an A1C result of 5.7 percent — 6.4 percent.  The results of a fasting glucose test that are 100-125mg/dl indicate IFG. If an oral glucose tolerance test is performed and the result is 140-199, it indicates IGT. All are considered prediabetes.

Medicare, Medicaid and the military foot a large portion of that bill, paying for 62.4 percent of the cost of care, while 34.4 percent is paid for by private insurers and 3.2 percent by the uninsured, according to the ADA. The medical community has so far failed to contain prediabetes. A big part of the problem: People simply avoid going to the doctor. William Argenta was 48 when he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a couple of years ago. He had not been to a doctor in more than five years and only received the diagnosis when he finally decided to go in for a physical. He had experienced a feeling of being overly thirsty — often a sign of diabetes — but other than that, he didn't see any reason to get checked out. Once a patient is diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, they are advised to change their eating and exercise habits. Many are prescribed metformin — it is the most widely prescribed drug for diabetes under many brand names, including Glucophage — and helps control blood sugar levels. Metformin lowers blood glucose by reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver and by helping the body respond better to the insulin made in the pancreas. The FDA has approved metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but not for prediabetes, which is a serious health condition but does not reach the blood sugar level to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The FDA has been conservative about approving drugs for use beyond specific disease states. However, the FDA is now considering approval of metformin for use in prediabetes. While physicians can already administer it at their own discretion, the ADA says the drug is currently underused as part of treatment options. Ongoing follow-up to the federally funded Diabetes Prevention Program research study has shown that metformin has long-term cost-saving value in delaying type 2 diabetes, with great safety and low cost to the consumer, which may persuade the FDA to approve an indication for prediabetes. According to the ADA, metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes should be considered for people who have a high body mass index BMI, are aged 60 years or older, have rising A1C test results, despite lifestyle intervention, and for women with prior pregnancy-related glucose intolerance. There are several other drugs prescribed for prediabetes, including a weight loss drug,  but many have significant side effects. The ADA states that metformin has the best track record and safety profile. The ADA also notes that even metformin has been shown to be less effective than lifestyle modification — lifestyle changes can slow or prevent type 2 diabetes in some individuals with a genetic predisposition. Now a type 2 diabetic, Argenta has changed his lifestyle. He cut down on sugary food and has increased his protein intake. He is also exercising and taking metformin and a couple of other medications. Argenta says he now feels much better than he did before he was diagnosed. ""I guess I had just gotten used to feeling bad. Your body adjusts to it in some ways,"" he says. The CDC, ADA and the American Medical Association have launched a new prediabetes awareness campaign, DoIHavePrediabetes.org. The campaign encourages people to take an online test of seven simple questions that can assess a person's prediabetes risk. The organizations are also beseeching those at risk to change their eating and exercise habits before their condition worsens. Dr. Rhonda Todd, MD, internal medicine, is doing her part to raise prediabetes awareness. Based near Ann Arbor, Michigan, she tries to test as many of her patients as she can for prediabetes if they fit a risk profile, using the A1C test. Most private insurers cover the expense of an A1C test, as do Medicaid and Medicare when the patient present risk factors. Todd said she has never had a problem getting a test approved. The cost of the test is roughly $50 dollars, but Todd has seen some hospitals offer the test for $10, as a part of wellness programs. ""I will try to test every patient I see who is over 35, has a family history of the disease or who is obese or overweight, which is almost everybody,"" she says. Todd blames the sedentary lifestyle of Americans for the explosion of diabetes and prediabetes cases. ""We are not a healthy people anymore, technology is killing us,"" she said. Todd said the majority of doctors, many of whom are affiliated with hospitals, test for prediabetes often. She thinks the bigger problem is people not going to the doctor rather than doctor's not offering the tests. The ADA recommends testing for prediabetes in adults of any age who are overweight or obese and who have one or more additional risk factors. For all people, testing should begin at age 45 years and be carried out at a minimum of three-year intervals. Every 21 seconds another person in the United States is diagnosed with diabetes, according to the ADA. That's 4,110 people in America diagnosed with the disease every 24 hours. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all those cases. The risk for developing the disease also increases drastically in people age 45 and older, and after age 65 it increases exponentially. There has also been a troubling rise in the number of adolescents developing both prediabetes and diabetes. Weight has a lot to do with it. Among adolescents, ages 12 to 19, about 1 in 5 are considered to have obesity, and about 1 in 11 (9.1 percent) are considered to have extreme obesity, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""Nutrition for adolescents is the cornerstone of treatment,"" Cefalu said. ""People need access to adequate nutrition, and you have to get that information in their hands."" Testing for prediabetes in children and adolescents should be considered for those who are overweight or obese, and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes, including having a family history of type 2 diabetes, or who are African American, Native American, Latino, or Asian Pacific Islanders. More than half of Asian-Americans and nearly half of Hispanic Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. Health-care specialists say getting people to change their behavior isn't easy. ""Telling people to lose weight does not give them enough information. It is not a message that helps and supports them,"" Albright said. To teach people how to change and maintain a new set of lifestyle habits, the CDC is also promoting its National Diabetes Prevention Program, which was initiated in 2010. Just by participating and staying in the program, prediabetics can lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 58 percent over three years, and by 71 percent for people over age 60. ""We want to help them determine what is realistic and doable so they can make real life changes that are sustainable,"" Albright said. A DDP program can cost as much as $500 a year. (The CDC-recognized organizations delivering these programs determine the cost, which can vary depending on factors such as the size and experience of the organization offering it.)  Diabetes prevention programs are growing in number and participation, but are still underutilized, according to the ADA. The CDC is working with commercial health plans and employers, including state employers, asking them to consider offering the program as part of their health-care benefit packages or wellness programs. To date, 11 states are providing coverage for more than 3 million public employees, over 65 commercial payers are providing coverage in some markets, and four states are providing Medicaid coverage. The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services is in the final stage of approving this service for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The YMCA in many states also offers access to the program on a sliding-scale fee basis. Prevention does work. By losing just 5 percent to 7 percent of one's  body weight (10-15 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and practicing a basic exercise regime — such as taking a brisk walk, 30 minutes a day, five days a week — many people are able to return their blood glucose levels to the normal range, according to the CDC. But for lasting and widespread change to take place, more health-care professionals will need to get on board and proactively talk to people about the risk of diabetes and prediabetes, Cefalu said. ""We need to educate and train primary care providers, nurse educators and nutritionists, so they can better inform their patients about the condition and how to treat it."" While a physician referral is not required for an eligible participant to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle change program, the CDC has partnered with the American Medical Association on the Prevent Diabetes STAT (Screen, Test, Act Today). ""All sectors, including health care, business, nonprofit community organizations and faith-based organizations, need to be talking about prediabetes and encouraging those with prediabetes to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle-change program,"" Albright said.

19,Catherine Clifford,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"Amazon paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods Market may be a savvy business decision for both parties — Amazon has been dabbling in groceries and Whole Foods needs to better compete with the burgeoning natural foods market it helped launch. But the founding ethos of the companies are as different as a chocolate pop tart and organic oatmeal. Amazon is the result of Jeff Bezos' obsession with the efficiency and scalability of the Internet. The Seattle-based tech giant's vision is ""to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online"" according to its mission statement, and to get it to you overnight. The company has grown to have a market capitalization of $457 billion because Americans will pay for convenience. Whole Foods, meanwhile, is the result of an idealistic attempt to change the way people eat, making them healthier, while promoting sustainable, fairly harvested foods and ethically sourced meats. Amazon is making changes to Whole Foods immediately. The acquisition deal officially closed Monday and already the new ownership started cutting prices, working to combat the perception that shopping at Whole Foods required spending your ""whole paycheck."" After hitting a peak stock price of over $60 in 2013, Whole Foods started to get beaten by the very same competition that it inspired into existence. A leader in bringing natural foods into the mainstream, soon food retail giants like Wal-Mart and Kroger started selling in the category, Trader Joe's launched, and meal-at-home kits like Blue Apron changed the way healthy eaters started shopping. With all the competition, Whole Foods suffered. Its stock price fell by more than half and activist investors like Jana Partners began to assert ownership rights, much to the dismay of co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey, the only original founder still with the company. Though he admitted the company had changes to make, Mackey was against selling Whole Foods. Mackey, whose salary as CEO has only been $1 a year since 2006, is making $8 million from the sale of Whole Foods to Amazon, surprisingly little for a company sale of this size. He owns 980,000 shares of Whole Foods stock and the sale is based on a share price of $42. Jana Partners' profit is reportedly $300 million. It all started on a vegetarian co-op in Austin Mackey, now 63, grew up eating cocoa puffs for breakfast, a hamburger for lunch and boxed macaroni and cheese for dinner, he tells host Guy Raz on a recent episode of the NPR show, ""How I Built This."" He didn't start to understand that there was a value in eating a vegetable-based, healthy diet until he moved into a vegetarian co-op, when he was 23, which, at the time, he thought of as an adventure. At the vegetarian co-op, Mackey, who had dropped out of college because he found the required classes boring, became the buyer for the group. He was fascinated with the potential of healthy eating. Without a diploma but newly inspired by the power of organic eating, Mackey and his then girlfriend, Renee Lawson Hardy, decided to go out on their own and open a natural grocery store. They set out to raise $50,000, but could only muster $45,000. In 1978, they opened shop on the first floor of an old house in Austin with a cafe on the second floor. The couple lived on the third floor. It was called SaferWay, it didn't sell meat or anything with sugar and it primarily served Austin hippies. Two years later, Mackey and Hardy approached another local natural grocery store, Clarksville Natural Grocery, owned by Craig Weller and Mark Skiles, about joining forces. The four went into business together to open the first Whole Foods Market in 1980. In an effort to expand the clientele, the four started selling meat, beer and wine. From the first day they opened, Whole Foods Market was a success. ""People were so excited about this first store. It was amazing, and we didn't do any advertising. We just opened the doors,"" says Mackey on ""How I Built This."" ""The word of mouth was incredible. The whole Austin counter culture hippie community knew about it immediately."" Near-death experience When Mackey looked to rent the space that would become the first Whole Foods Market, the landlord mentioned it was in a 100-year-flood zone, meaning that once every hundred years the area would flood. Mackey, enthusiastic, young and eager to grow, didn't flinch. He was willing to take the risk. It turned out to be a losing bet. In the Spring of 1981, that 100-year flood landed. The store was drowned, sewage forced out of pipes, inventory ruined and looters came and trashed the store. Mackey remembers wading through the dark waters to get whatever cash they had left in the store safe. They didn't have flood insurance. ""We thought we were pretty much out of business,"" says Mackey. ""By all rights, Whole Foods should have died through that flood. We had to rebuild the store and it was going to cost a lot of money to do that and we just didn't have the money, so I thought, we all thought, we were finished."" The Austin community stepped up to save the business. Customers pitched in to help with the cleanup effort, investors put in more money, banks extended credit lines and team members (employees) worked for free to get the store back open. ""We were really united around that near death experience,"" Mackey says. When they got the store re-opened, Mackey was determined to expand. ""I wanted to open a second store after the flood. It was like, we can't put all of our eggs in a basket that might float down the river."" In 1988, when Mackey approached venture capitalists for the money to expand in a significant way, he was repeatedly rejected. He remembers one VC telling him the market was too niche: ""You know, John, I see you have got a pretty good business here, but it looks to me — I looked at all the stores — like you are a just a bunch of hippies and you are just selling food to other hippies and I don't think that is a very big market,"" he told Mackey. A decade later, that same venture capitalist told Mackey not investing in Whole Foods was the worst decision he'd ever made. Mackey did raise venture money though: Whole Foods sold 34 percent of the business for an $8.5 million valuation, which at the time was about 15 to 20 percent of sales, says Mackey on ""How I Built This."" Hungry for cash to grow further but uninterested in handing over more of his company to venture capitalists, Mackey took Whole Foods public in 1992 and raised $28 million valuing the company at $100 million. With the cash, Whole Foods scooped up a slew of other natural food markets around the country. Whole Foods' growth continued as eating healthy became increasingly mainstream. In 2016, there were more than 460 stores in the United States, the company did $16 billion in sales and had 87,000 employees,  according to a recent financial disclosure. Of course, that growth didn't come without controversy. In 2015, the store was taken to task for systematically over-weighing and overcharging certain food items. Whole Foods  denied that these errors were anything other than inadvertent. ""There will be no one that ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as I love it"" Unable to thwart the pressure from investors to sell the struggling chain, Mackey is caught between his ideals and a need to keep afloat the business that he created. ""There is no point in business where you can say, 'At last, I have arrived.' What makes business so amazing is, what makes capitalism so dynamic is that in fact, if you are successful, people copy you. And that's what has happened with Whole Foods. A lot of people have copied us. That helps keep your edge,"" says Mackey. Today, Mackey still lives in Austin and purposefully drives by the location of the first store, which is now a school. He thinks of the past, but he also understands that to stay in business means evolution. ""There will be no one that ever loves Whole Foods Market as much as I love it,"" says Mackey. ""But building a business is a little bit like having children and watching the children grow up ... you hope your child is healthy, you hope your child is happy and you hope your child has integrity and does the right thing. And I think it is important to have a good founder and entrepreneur but the great businesses continue to live on after the founder moves. I certainly hope Whole Foods is in that space.""

22,Zameena Mejia,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"Face it, we can't all be Elon Musk and work nearly 90 hours a week. Nor are we all fortunate enough to make a living working under 40 hours a week. No matter where you fall, half of all Americans feel  overworked and burned out. Amber Discko, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer who worked on her social media team, is out to change that. Discko, 27, created the beginnings of self-care app Aloe while experiencing a difficult time working the final four months of Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""It was an incredible experience to work on it, but it was hard to balance my mental health with the stress of the campaign and dealing with the toxic news cycle,"" Discko tells CNBC Make It. She created a personal checklist, which assessed wellness items like if she was hydrated, had taken a break from the computer screen in the last hour and if she had been going to sleep on time. Despite working with a ""diverse, smart group of people,"" she noticed that others working on the campaign were also suffering from exhaustion. ""It's very common, especially with millennials, to overwork yourself when you're super passionate about a cause,"" Discko says. ""We are so driven to do our best that we let other things slide by."" Discko surpassed her  Kickstarter $40,000 goal, raising $50,528 for Aloe, primarily through Twitter followers, and continues receiving support through creative funding platform Patreon. The app is expected to be released for iOS devices first in January with Android to come later. With help from the Femsplain community, an online publication Discko ran the past three years, Aloe already exists in the form of her now-public, online self-care checklist, a printable checklist for your desk and as interactive Twitter bot ""@aloebud."" garden tweet Once completed, Aloe will have three main sections: a check-in area to mark your accomplishments, a reminders section to motivate you throughout the day and a mad-lib style reflections section that gives a glance at how you feel and what your next goal will be. There will also be also a community support feature to connect with others using the app. Discko says Aloe will provide a simpler path to wellness for even the hardest workers out there. She hopes teams in offices will put the app to use. ""Because people are chained to their desks, they are working long hours,"" Discko says. ""I'm hoping if workplaces can encourage their teams to take moments for themselves throughout the day, it will create a better environment to work in."" For those who are unsure if they feel worker burnout, Stanford psychologist and research scientist Emma Seppälä notes it's when you are lacking energy, feeling down and feel generally unmotivated to do work. ""It seems ridiculous to need an app to remind you to sleep, breathe, eat,"" Seppälä tells CNBC Make It, ""but we've gotten to the point where people do need reminders."" She says this is because people are caught up in an ""overwhelming"" amount of responsibilities. ""Plunged into our virtual worlds and crunched for time, we tune out completely from our own needs for sleep, exercise, even food,"" Seppala says. In researching her book, ""The Happiness Track,"" Seppälä found that half of American workers, regardless of profession or position in corporate hierarchies,  are burned out. ""We've gotten so addicted to working, we're so overwhelmed with notifications from our devices, and we're generally so overwhelmed trying to balance home life and work,"" Seppälä says, ""that it's no surprise we're seeing 50 percent burnout across industries right now."" work tweet Apps like Aloe can provide reminders and a  supportive community to help keep us on track, Seppälä says. ""We are profoundly social people for whom connection and a sense of belonging is crucial for health and happiness,"" Seppälä says. Since we are no longer always living in tight-knit communities with family and friends reminding us to take care of ourselves or pitching in to help cook a meal, Seppälä says ""online communities are sometimes a great way to make sure you have people to connect with, be motivated by and look out for."" Without self-care, notes Seppälä, comes more burnout. ""When complete burnout happens, then you can have health consequences,"" she notes, including stress-induced health problems like inflammation and diabetes. Discko says she has received online criticism and constant questions about the usefulness or necessity for the app, which will be free when launched and have in-app upgrades for personalization. A post shared by Aloe (@aloebud) on Mar 10, 2017 at 10:18am PST But Seppälä wants people to consider this: health care expenditures at high-pressure companies are nearly 50% greater than at other organizations. She cites an  American Psychological Association estimate which finds that the U.S. economy loses more than $500 billion due to workplace stress as well as 550 million workdays lost yearly to stress on the job. Seppälä says wellness apps like Aloe can promote a more inclusive workplace culture if the entire work culture buys into the idea that self-care is important, adding they should ""for the sake of the bottom line if anything."" ""You need an entire workforce, and especially its leaders, to support the idea,"" Seppälä says. Discko says Aloe can help bosses and managers lead the conversation on mental health at work. ""Being able to say you need to take a moment to manage your own health and talk with your colleagues who know you've been working hard is important,"" Discko says.

23,Joe Tenebruso,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In a previous article, I laid out the bear case against Altria Group (NYSE:MO). Today, let's take a look at some ways the tobacco titan's stock could trend higher in the coming years. As the number of people who smoke continues to decline, the tobacco industry has turned its focus toward new products that are believed to have fewer health risks. One such product that shows particular promise is Philip Morris International's (NYSE:PM) iQOS system. The iQOS is an electric device that heats -- but does not burn -- a new type of cigarette called a Marlboro HeatStick. Instead of smoke, it produces a nicotine-containing vapor. Philip Morris says that this vapor is less dangerous than traditional cigarette smoke, and that the iQOS creates a more enjoyable experience for smokers than existing e-cigarettes. Image source: Philip Morris International. Altria already has a deal in place with Philip Morris that gives it exclusive distribution rights to the iQOS in the U.S. Altria hopes Philip Morris can get approval for iQOS from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sometime in the next year or so, at which time Altria will begin marketing the product in the United States. I should note, though, that if reduced-risk products like iQOS catch on in the U.S., shipments of traditional smokable cigarettes are likely to drop precipitously. In fact, when Philip Morris launched iQOS in Japan last April, the product quickly cannibalized about a third of its own cigarette portfolio in the country. Fortunately for Philip Morris, many of the smokers who switched to iQOS came from its cheaper brands, thereby boosting the company's overall revenue. Moreover, if iQOS earns a modified risk tobacco product designation from the FDA, it could rapidly take market share from rival products that cannot make such a claim. Philip Morris plans to make iQOS available in more than 30 countries by the end of 2017. The U.S. could follow soon after -- if iQOS receives FDA approval -- thereby providing Altria with an important new product line and a potentially significant revenue growth driver. Recent consolidation in the U.S. tobacco industry may make Altria's days as an independent entity numbered. While Altria remains the market share leader, its No. 2 and No. 3 rivals combined when Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) acquired Lorillard in 2015. Reynolds American then agreed to be acquired by international giant British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) earlier this year in a deal that will form the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company. Ever since British American and Reynolds American agreed to merge, rumors have swirled that Philip Morris and Altria would recombine in order to match their rival's newfound global scale. In fact, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog places the odds of a deal at 70%. For this to occur, Philip Morris, as the larger company, would likely acquire Altria. The buyout price would need to include a significant premium to Altria's current stock price in order to entice investors to approve the deal. An offer in the $77 to $80 range could be well received by shareholders and would give investors who buy Altria's shares today gains of roughly 20% to 25%. Of course, a deal might not take place, and speculating on acquisitions can be a dangerous investment strategy. So, Fools who decide to invest in Altria should do so only if they're comfortable owning the company in its current form. ","

24,Todd Campbell,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: My fingers are tired from writing ""I'm sorry, mea culpa!"" in preparation for today's episode. [laughs] Campbell: No. I think any investor that's been investing for a while recognizes that mistakes are common, and they can be wonderful teaching moments, so let's keep that in mind as we go through. Harjes: Exactly. So, we'll have a clip where I said something that was wrong, and then for the second half of the show, we'll go over to one that Todd picked out for a prediction of his that was not quite on the target. To kick things off, here's a clip from our Oct. 28, 2015, show. This show was called ""Walgreens Shows Its Hand, Scoops Up Rite Aid."" So that was my speculation. For some context, the original deal that we were talking about was for $9.7 billion. It was announced in October of 2015 that Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9 a share. That was later revised down to about $6.50-$7. It all depended on how many stores were divested. For some additional context here, these are the two major retail pharmacy players in the United States, and therefore the FTC did not want the type of power consolidation that could be involved with this deal. That's why there was the first revision of the plan. And eventually, we found out in June 29 of this year that the entire deal had fallen through, and the original FTC decision had been scheduled for July 7, but Walgreens ended up saying, ""You know, they're just not going to approve this, so we're going to offer up a new deal to acquire just about half of Rite Aid's stores,"" which is a heck of a lot smaller than the original deal. And that's where we stand now. We had more details about this new version of the deal on the episode that we did on July 5, but there's no getting around the fact that back in October of 2015, I was just totally off the mark saying the FTC would let this deal go through. Campbell: You were just hopeful! You were hopeful! There's nothing wrong with hopeful. Yes, you were optimistic. As investors, we sometimes get optimistic, and we connected some dots, and the dots were, with the push to try and drive down prices, maybe they would let this go through. The reality is, however, there's no denying that the pharmacy marketplace has gotten very consolidated since 2000. You've got a handful of players who dominate that market. You have Walgreens, you've got CVS, and you've got Rite Aid. So, combining Walgreens and Rite Aid together, OK, yeah, that would have created a behemoth in the space, and theoretically, that could have eliminated competition in certain local markets to the point where they weren't going to get this deal approved. Shares of Rite Aid, Kristine, have been absolutely pummeled on the news of the new revised deal. Harjes: Yeah, they fell 26%. Campbell: I'm curious to put you on the spot again for next year's episode -- Harjes: Oh, great! [laughs] Campbell: -- and see if you have any thoughts for Rite Aid from here. Will this deal get through? Harjes: Yeah, I'm really hesitant to speculate again on it. But it's really hard not to do, because watching what has happened to Rite Aid's shares over the past 22 months -- I think that's the right number -- since Walgreens started talking to the FTC about potentially scooping up some or all of Rite Aid, it is fascinating. Rite Aid's shares are down to about one-third of the level they were before this deal was ever announced. They're down 73% just since the beginning of this year. Right now, they're hovering around $2.25 a share. If you recall, the original deal was for $9 per Rite Aid share, so the market has just completely crippled Rite Aid. Campbell: Kristine, just to jump in for one quick second because I don't want to forget this point, what's interesting to think about, in that original deal, if you include debt, that deal was worth over $17 billion. So Walgreens was willing to pay, including debts, $17 billion to get its hands on Rite Aid. Now, what's Rite Aid's market cap today? Harjes: $2.34 billion. Campbell: $2.34 billion, and they still have half their stores, and they still have their pharmacy benefit manager. So I wonder if there's a little bit of a disconnect. Maybe that's the uncertainty. The uncertainty is, we don't know whether or not the deal will close, and if it doesn't close, you still have Rite Aid as a relatively troubled and highly indebted company. Harjes: Yeah, they have $7.2 billion in debt. I think, actually, I have learned from being wrong the first time about this, because I'm so intrigued by Rite Aid as a value play right now, but I haven't bought any shares, and I think that actually is the hesitation of, I was wrong about whether or not the FTC would let this go through once. I could be wrong again, even though right now, sitting here looking at it, I'm going to say, I do think this will go through. And even if not, I think Rite Aid is grossly undervalued. But that being said, I still haven't put my money behind it, because I'm looking at this like, well, I understood the situation incorrectly the first time around, so I'm going to try to learn from that and say deals are not done deals until they go through. It's dangerous to try to grab an arbitrage opportunity, especially because if you look at what happens when these deals fall through, the stocks are absolutely crushed. And while it doesn't look like to me that Rite Aid has farther that it could really fall based on the value of the business alone, it could. And who am I to say that won't? Campbell: Right. Is this a falling knife or a value trap? Or is this truly a bargain-bin buy? That's the big question. I had a mentor back in the '90s, Kristine, and one of the things that I learned from that mentor was, don't worry too much about the bottom 10% of a move or the top 10% of a move. Focus your attention on that 80% in the middle. So I think investors should basically take a step back and say, ""I don't need to be perfect in timing my entry and trying to get to the bottom. Why don't I let this play out a little bit, because it's likely that if it does close, there will be opportunities for me to benefit and make that 80% of the move after, rather than trying to be a hero and stepping up into the uncertainty?"" Harjes: Yeah, I think that's great advice. For investors looking to do that here, take a look at the value of the stores. Consider that Walgreens will be able to cherry-pick the ones that it wants. Also consider that the way in which it will cherry-pick them will have a lot to do with what the FTC says it's allowed to choose as far as the geographical footprint goes. Also, look at its PBM. Rite Aid has EnvisionRx, its pharmacy benefits manager. That's a whole other part of this business that doesn't really get talked about a lot, and I suspect the value of that isn't really being considered in the full market cap of this company. Campbell: Yeah, Kristine, just to jump in again on that point, because it's a good one, I crunched some numbers on that not that long ago in an article I posted on The Motley Fool, and one of the conclusions I came to is, as a standalone company, that EnvisionRx could be worth anywhere between $2.4 and $4 billion on its own, which is intriguing. Harjes: Interesting. Yeah, I don't think I read that one yet, so I will definitely go ahead to the site and look for it. If anyone listening wants to read it, shoot us an email at industryfocus@fool.com, and I will dig it up and send it along for you. Todd, I'm going to take myself out of the mistakes spotlight and pivot over to you. In our July 27, 2016, show, we talked about CEOs that were enormously successful in one business venture who were back at it trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. We featured Tesaro, NantKwest, Puma Biotech, and OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK). And in an effort to put you on the spot, or give our readers a tidy conclusion, I asked you to pick your favorite. Here's a refresher of what you said: Harjes: Any thoughts on that? Campbell: I could have picked Tesaro's Lonnie Moulder. Tesaro got an approval for their PARP inhibitor, and sure enough, its shares have gone from $95 to a high of $180 and still trading around $120. That would have worked. I could have picked Puma. It got its approval of Nerlynx recently, and its shares have gone from $49 to $80. But no, [laughs] I settled with the safe play, going with Phillip Frost, OPKO Health. And sure enough, its shares have been flushed down the toilet bowl, falling from $10 to about $6, which is even more painful when you think about the fact that this has been one of the strongest periods for market returns in recent memory. Harjes: So. [laughs] What did you learn from this? Campbell: There were reasons that I sided with and picked Phillip Frost. Phillip Frost is a proven leader. And I love investing in companies with proven leaders. Rome wasn't built in a day. Phillip Frost has been starting, successfully, running companies, and then selling them since the 1970s, and he's one of the wealthiest healthcare entrepreneurs in America. So I think sidling up next to him was not necessarily a mistake long-term, but certainly a mistake short-term. And I think the short-term mistake I made was to fail to understand how much shares could fall if a couple of key catalysts were either slow to develop or outright disappointed. Do you me want to walk through those catalysts, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, there's been a handful of them over the last year or so since we talked about this. Do you want to start with maybe the slow launch of Rayaldee? Campbell: Yeah. Rayaldee is a very intriguing drug, because it's a prohormone for vitamin D that works better than existing vitamin D supplements that are given to patients with chronic kidney disease, that suffer from vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency can cause calcium loss in bones, bone weakness, and all sorts of other problems. So it's an important indication; it's important to have treatment options available for it. The problem is, after Rayaldee launched, it did not have widespread early-on inclusion in drug formularies at insurers. So the patient population that was covered by insurers that would pay for these drugs was pretty small, and sales, frankly, have been a rounding error and aren't even broken out in OPKO Health's quarterly results yet. Perhaps, according to Phillip Frost in the second-quarter conference call, they'll start to break those numbers out for us in the fourth quarter of this year. And there's opportunities there theoretically for Rayaldee to finally deliver on its promise. But Rayaldee wasn't the only disappointment. You also had Varubi, which is a drug that's approved for use in patients who are suffering from vomiting and nausea after receiving chemotherapy. That's a very important market. It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and Varubi is licensed by Tesaro, which is Lonnie Moulder's company. So far, sales have been slow to grow. Sales in the second quarter were only about $2.9 million, and with OPKO collecting double-digit royalties, again, a rounding error considering that the company is doing $300 million roughly in quarterly revenue because of its diagnostics business. Harjes: And that wasn't even the only disappointment. Campbell: Yeah. They also came up shy in a very important trial that was evaluating the long-lasting human growth hormone treatment in adults. They have a drug that's partnered up with Pfizer. A lot of people thought that if this drug reached the market and eventually got approved for use in kids, pediatric use, then this could be a big moneymaker for OPKO Health. Unfortunately, in December, they announced that the trial missed its mark. They haven't given up on the drug, but that trial was a failure. So overall, you have this confluence of disappointments over the course of the last 12 months that has really taken a toll on the company's stock price. You add that together with the fact that sales in the diagnostic business, which is basically the specialty lab that they run, have pretty much flatlined at around $300 million, a little over $300 million, there hasn't been a lot of excitement or enthusiasm to drive up the market cap of this company. Harjes: So, clearly, it's been a disappointing year for OPKO shareholders. Where do you stand now going forward on it, Todd? Do you think it's, ""Looking back on it, I was wrong, this is a terrible company, investors should stay far away from it,"" or do you think that now, at the lower share price, there might be an even better opportunity for investors to scoop up some shares at a discounted price, because now, going forward, is where the real promise is? Or something in between the two? Campbell: There's a couple different takeaways I guess I have on this whole thing. I think, yes, you stick with proven leaders, and yes, there's a lot of opportunity still ahead for OPKO. I don't like buying drug-development stocks on sale as using the value argument only because, as we saw last year, a lot can happen with clinical trials. You can say, ""There's all sorts of opportunities still in the pipeline,"" which there is, drugs that could rack up lots of sales for this company over time. But those trials could fail. You have to take a look at it and say, ""I'm not going to buy it solely because it's cheap relative to where it was last year. Things happened that the outlook now has changed."" But I think you can look at it and say, Rayaldee could still deliver on the goods. We'll know better early next year what the sales trend, the prescription trend is for that. Varubi, which again is marketed by Tesaro, there's a PDUFA date at the FDA that could approve an IV formulation. If that formulation gets approved, that opens up the vast majority of the marketplace for this type or this class of drugs. That, theoretically, could start meaningfully generating revenue in 2018. And there's a pediatric study ongoing in human growth hormone still that reads out in 2019. If that trial is good, then Pfizer and OPKO will split the profits on both OPKO's drug and Pfizer's existing drug in that indication, Genotropin, which is selling at a clip of over $100 million per quarter. So there's still reasons besides value that you'd want to own OPKO Health. And certainly, Phillip Frost remains incredibly committed as a shareholder in this company. He continues and has continued to increase the number of shares he owns over the past year, even in the face of all these disappointments. Harjes: Some of the dates that you mentioned when you were running down your list of catalysts going forward are pretty far in the future. That speaks to me about a bigger problem with investing in biotech, which is opportunity cost. Many of the stocks that look interesting today are likely to take a long time before they prove out. Something that regular listeners of the show have heard us talk about before is keeping an investing journal. That's so important, so I'm going to say it again -- keep an investing journal, specifically to combat this type of mistake, or looking at the mistake incorrectly when maybe it wasn't quite a mistake yet, is to write down exactly the dates that you're looking for. So the PDUFA dates, when the FDA might approve a drug, or a forecast for when you think a company is finally going to turn profitable, things like that where, if it's a date that's relevant to your investment thesis, you want to have it written down in front of you, so that when that date comes and goes you can reevaluate your thinking and figure out if, indeed, you were right. If, for example, your investing thesis for OPKO had something to do with a PDUFA date that's years and years out, you want to know that and you want to be very aware of it for several reasons, one of which is that, maybe it's not really the time to invest just yet. Maybe there are better places for your money now where you can get more validation sooner that you actually are placing your money in the proper place. Of course, we are long-term investors here at The Fool, but in the short term, if you're going to look at a company that is declining over the course of one year and think, ""Oh my gosh, I was wrong, I need to exit,"" but you're still waiting for a catalyst that's years in the future, then you're going to end up cutting yourself short, and you'll never even see the potential gains that you were hoping to get in the very beginning. Campbell: That's a great point, Kristine. I'm going to throw another point out there, too. We've talked about on the show previously, especially in biotech, diversify, diversify, diversify. I selected one stock out of these four -- Harjes: To be fair, I made you do that. Campbell: Yeah. Well, that exposed us to a lot more risk. If we had just invested across all four of them, you would have done very well, because of the success that we saw with Puma and Tesaro. So, I think diversification is always something that's very important across this space. Never put all your eggs in one basket hoping that you're going to hit a home run. Harjes: Yeah. And it's important not to beat yourself up too much about single mistakes, because overall, if you're right 50% of the time, you're a really, really good stock picker. Campbell: Very good stock picker, and you'd be a great baseball player. Harjes: Yeah, exactly! So, Todd, I'm not going to beat you up too much about the OPKO mistake, and I'll try not to beat myself up too much about getting the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger information predicted incorrectly. And that'll do it. Hopefully we can learn from these mistakes and move forward and be right at least 50% of the time, hopefully more! As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. This show is produced by Austin Morgan. For Todd Campbell, I'm Kristine Harjes. Thanks for listening and Fool on! ","
      
    Boy, Were We Wrong About Rite Aid and Opko Health -- The Motley Fool

There's no question they're bad for your health. But given their addictive nature, both beer and cigarettes have proven to be investments with enviable returns. That's why so many investors flock to Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). But which of these dividend-paying stalwarts is a better bet for your portfolio today? While that's not a question that can be answered with 100% certainty, there are ways to getting some more clarity on the decision. If we break it down to three simple categories, the picture gets clearer. Image source: Getty Images This is by far the most important thing to keep an eye on for long-term investors. A sustainable competitive advantage -- otherwise referred to as a ""moat"" -- is what differentiates one company from the next. Because there's nothing prohibiting start-ups from making their own beer or cigarettes, the key moat for both of these companies is the strength of their brands. Given both companies' ubiquity globally, and the apparent pricing power that comes with those brands, I'm calling this one a tie. Winner: Tie The main draw for investors in these companies is the dividend that they pay out. With recognizable brands and comparatively low input costs, they both spit out lots of cash. But while we'll get to those payments in a minute, it's worth considering how much cash the company keeps on hand for a rainy day as well. While such an allocation might be boring, it is also crucial. That's because every company, at one point or another, is bound to experience difficult economic times. Those that have cash on hand have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire weaker rivals at a discount, or outspend the competition into bankruptcy. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet. Here's how these two stack up, keeping in mind that Anheuser is valued at a 25% premium -- via market capitalization -- to Philip Morris. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Philip Morris $7.3 billion $26.6 billion $7 billion $8.1 billion Anheuser-Busch InBev $30 billion $108 billion $4 billion $6.5 billion Data sources: SEC filings and Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. Figures rounded to nearest billion. To be honest, I'm not terribly impressed with either company's balance sheet. While reliable free cash flow means that neither has much to worry about when it comes to meeting their debt obligations, both companies have a fair amount of leverage. Both companies have identical cash-to-debt ratios, but the differentiator is Philip Morris' free cash flow, which is far superior to Anheuser-Busch, even though the latter is a bigger company. Winner: Philip Morris And then we have valuation. There's no one metric that can tell you just how expensive a stock is. Instead, I like to use a number of data points to get a more holistic picture. Company P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Philip Morris 26 23 2.3 Anheuser-Busch InBev 39 35 1.3 Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance, and E*Trade. P/E represents non-GAAP earnings. On the surface it might seem that Philip Morris is cheaper than Anheuser -- on both an earnings and free cash flow basis. But it's important to remember that the latter's numbers are slightly skewed given the acquisition of SAB Miller. That's where the PEG ratio -- which factors normalized growth into the equation -- comes in. On that metric, Anheuser appears to be trading at a 40% discount to Philip Morris. With both companies having relatively similar and strong yields, the scale tips ever-so-slightly in favor of Anheuser-Busch. Winner: Anheuser-Busch InBev So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have strong moats provided by their ubiquitous brands. Philip Morris has the stronger cash flows for now, while investors appear to be getting a better bargain on Anheuser-Busch InBev at current price levels. ","

26,Sean Williams,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it comes to growth industries, essentially nothing tops legal marijuana. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, the legal cannabis market in North America is slated to grow from $6.9 billion in 2016 to an estimated $21.6 billion by 2021 -- a 26% compound annual growth rate. This growth is possible because the American public's aggregate opinion on pot has rapidly shifted over the past two decades. Back in 1995, national pollster Gallup found that only 25% of respondents wanted to see marijuana legal across the United States. However, by 2016, this had increased to an all-time record high of 60%. What's more, a separate study released by Quinnipiac University in April 2017 found that an overwhelming 94% of respondents favored the national legalization of medical cannabis. Given this latter support figure, it's probably not as shocking that 29 of 50 states have legalized medical marijuana since 1996. But what if medical cannabis isn't all it's been touted to be? Image source: Getty Images. According to two similar, but separate, publications in the Annals of Internal Medicine this August, medical cannabis has had few, if any, concretely positive impacts in treating chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One study, involving nearly a dozen authors, examined the impact that medical cannabis had on treating chronic pain, which is one of the most commonly prescribed indications. After analyzing data from 27 chronic-pain trials, researchers found only minimal evidence that medical weed was effective in alleviating neuropathic pain, and insufficient evidence that it relieved or alleviated pain in other patient populations. And that's not all. After completing 11 systematic reviews and 32 primary studies, the nearly one-dozen researchers found that using medical cannabis led to an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, psychotic symptoms, and short-term cognitive impairment. In other words, this group found that medical marijuana appears to be doing more harm than good. A second study, published the same day by the same group of authors, examined the effectiveness of medical cannabis in treating PTSD. In a nutshell, the researchers found that the study evidence examined was insufficient to draw any benefit or risk conclusions given that no randomized trials were found. Further, the studies were deemed to have a medium-to-high risk of bias, and observational studies found no benefit of cannabis use for PTSD patients. Image source: GW Pharmaceuticals. While the usual rules for published studies apply (i.e., that no concrete conclusions can be reached one way or another without additional research), there's also real-world evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant may not effectively treat pain. GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), the largest marijuana stock by market cap, and a company that's really excelled in recent years on the heels of clinical results from experimental cannabidiol-based drug Epidiolex for two rare types of childhood-onset epilepsy, has tasted failure in treating cancer pain before. Sativex, the company's only approved drug in more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. (Sativex isn't approved in the U.S.), failed miserably in a late-stage study in the U.S. examining its use in treating cancer pain back in 2015. Put plainly, cannabinoids and cannabis don't appear to be a guaranteed cure for pain. What's stopping drugmakers and researchers from running studies that lawmakers could use to make real-world decisions on the benefit-versus-risk profile of cannabis? Look no further than the drug's current scheduling. Image source: Getty Images. At the federal level, marijuana remains a schedule I substance, which means it has no medical benefits and is entirely illegal, like LSD and heroin. Because it's a schedule I drug, getting permission to run clinical studies is exceptionally difficult. In fact, there's currently just one federally permitted cannabis grow farm for medical research in Mississippi. And according to scientists via PBS, that grow farm has been producing moldy samples amid a lack of federal testing standards at the site.  In other words, red tape is holding back any opportunity for scientists to see if medical cannabis has the benefits that have been suggested in treating chronic pain, PTSD, and other diseases. How does this red tape get lifted? That's really anyone's guess at this point. President Donald Trump has previously aligned himself with the public in that he supports medical cannabis. However, his Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a huge opponent of marijuana and would likely fight tooth and nail against easing testing restrictions. It's possible lawmakers could be coerced into action by voters who could push dissenters out of office come election time, but it remains to be seen if a single issue like marijuana could hold enough weight to push politicians out of office. For the time being, there's a case that can be made from both sides of the aisle, and that's not good for the U.S. medical marijuana industry, nor is it good news for investors. Until we see meaningful change in Washington, there's little for the industry, or marijuana stock investors, to buzz about. ","

On Tuesday, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Han Tae Song, accused the U.S. of driving the Korean peninsula toward an ""extreme level of explosion,"" claiming the United States has ""openly declared its hostile intentions"" toward the country. Han said in response to the U.S. and South Korea holding ""aggressive"" joint military exercises in the region, ""despite repeated warnings,"" his country has ""every reason to respond with tough counter-measures."" While the ambassador did not explicitly refer to Monday's latest ballistic missile launched over Japan, Han warned the U.S. that it would be ""wholly responsible for the catastrophic consequences it will entail."" Following the missile launch, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Trump discussed over the phone the U.N. ramping up further pressure on North Korea and calling for an international response to the growing tensions in the region. The two called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to address these concerns. Mr. Trump, who earlier this month warned of ""fire and fury"" for the regime in response to its earlier missile launches, issued a new charge to the North, saying that ""all options are on the table"" to respond to the increasing threat posed by the country.

U.S. equity futures sold off late Monday, after North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan, seen as another direct provocation that could destabilize the region, but staged a turnaround in late-afternoon trade. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the missile test an “unprecedented, grave and serious threat that seriously damages peace and security in the region.” President Donald Trump has previously said the U.S. would react with “fire and fury” if Pyongyang stepped up threats against the U.S. and its allies. On Tuesday morning, he said that “all options are on the table” following the North Korean missile launch. Some traders told MarketWatch that the “measured” statement by Trump and the rest of the global community so far has provided a modicum of comfort to investors. “The response around the world, it was measured as of now, and I think it was probably helpful to the market,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. Kepner said the market wasn’t being dismissive of the latest military threat out of Pyongyang but said seasonally low volumes for the summer also make equity benchmarks more prone to swings. “North Korea is drawing another line in the sand, a little further out than the last line. This has real psychological ramifications for the markets; this might not end in a pretty fashion,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group. Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco, said: “There’s some level of optimism in the market.” Hooper said there is hope that the tragedy playing out in the Houston area in the fallout of Hurricane Harvey will be used to establish common ground amid the tense relationship between Trump and congressional leaders on budget negotiations and the debt ceiling. A lot will depend on the “ability of Congress and the president to find some common ground borne of their concern for victims of Hurricane Harvey,” Hooper said. The up-and-down trading action comes at a time when major U.S. stock-market indexes are solidly higher for the year, and trading near record levels. The S&P is up more than 9% in 2017, and is less than 2 percentage points off all-time highs. Beyond geopolitical concerns, investors have also been worried about Wall Street valuations. Read: Overseas stocks are still where the bargains are for U.S. investors “Valuation is rarely the only factor behind a market selloff, but it can exacerbate a market downturn when other factors are present,” Ghriskey said. “We’re not concerned about the market at these levels, but the Korea situation could get out of hand, which is the last thing anyone wants from a human or a market perspective.” Gold futures

The S&P has climbed 10.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 19% since the start of the year. “Biotech rally, which created an upside momentum in the market amid very low volumes, has been driving the market over the past two days,” said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. Some analysts said the market has been supported by earnings and a positive economic environment over the past several months. Thursday’s economic releases came in mostly in line with expectations, confirming a positive trend in growth. Low levels of first-time jobless claims  suggest the labor market remains robust, while consumer spending — the biggest driver of the economy — picked up in July, thanks to higher income for consumers and low inflation. “In an environment where the economy and earnings continue to grow, markets will also climb. Geopolitics shake up markets from time to time, but usually do not have long-lasting impact,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial. Equities and other assets viewed as relatively risky have stabilized after a late-August slump thanks in part to that better-than-expected U.S. data and a stronger-than-anticipated reading on Chinese manufacturing out Thursday, according to Richard Perry, a Hantec Markets analyst. Data deluge: Consumer spending rose 0.3% last month, helped by higher incomes and low inflation. The pace of inflation, meanwhile, was little changed in July, up 0.1%. Initial jobless claims in the period running from Aug. 20 to Aug. 26 rose by 1,000 to 236,000, which is still close to a postrecession low, pointing to another solid monthly employment report near the end of summer. The official jobs report will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on Friday. Separately, the Chicago PMI held steady at 58.9 in August.

30,Martin Feldstein,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 30, 2017 2:28 p.m. ET Impact on budget deficit should be temporary, writes Martin Feldstein By CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Project Syndicate) — The Republican Party’s leaders in the United States House of Representatives have been hard at work for more than a year designing a major reform of personal and corporate taxes. With an election looming in 2018, the House Republicans are determined to deliver a reform package and send it to the Senate for enactment. This reform will be very different from the last major tax overhaul enacted back in 1986. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 focused on the personal income tax, lowering the top rate from 50% to 28% and cutting rates for lower-income taxpayers. The revenue loss was offset by changes in tax deductions and other accounting rules, producing a reform that was revenue neutral at each income level, even without taking into account the effects of lower tax rates on increasing economic growth and taxable incomes. Also read: Live blog of President Trump’s speech on tax cuts In the 30 years since 1986, the tax rates for high-income taxpayers rose significantly, from 28% to 39.6%, with an extra 3.8% tax on these taxpayers’ investment income. A detailed study by the Congressional Budget Office of taxes between 1979 and 2013 concluded that while the effective tax rate fell in every quintile of the income distribution, it rose well above that 35-year average for taxpayers in the top 1% of the income distribution. The House Republican plan would cut the top tax rate back to 30% or lower, with comparable reductions for those now facing lower tax rates. The new tax law might also follow the Canadian example and eliminate the estate tax, while imposing a tax on capital gains accrued before the taxpayer’s death. To offset some of the resulting revenue loss, the new law might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income. The big difference between the House Republicans’ plan and the 1986 tax reform is that the current proposal would also address the tax treatment of corporate profits and other business income. The statutory tax rate on corporate profits is now 35%, the highest in the OECD. The new legislation would reduce that rate to 25% or less, spurring a shift in capital flows away from investments in housing and agriculture, and toward domestic corporate investment. Also read: Henry Aaron on why tax reform is doomed to fail this year The new tax law is also likely to boost domestic corporate investment by changing the tax treatment of the profits of U.S. corporations’ foreign subsidiaries. Under current law, a subsidiary pays tax on profits to the government of the country where those profits are earned. It can then invest the after-tax profits anywhere in the world outside the U.S. But if it brings those funds back to the U.S. to invest or pay dividends to shareholders, it must pay the full U.S. corporate tax rate, with a credit for the tax already paid to the foreign government. This penalty on repatriating funds causes U.S. firms to leave those after-tax profits abroad. The U.S. Treasury estimates that American subsidiaries’ offshore investments stand at more than $2.5 trillion. This method of taxing the profits of foreign subsidiaries is unique to the U.S. Every other industrial country uses what is known as the territorial method, in which profits of foreign subsidiaries can be brought home with little or no extra tax. By shifting the U.S. toward such a system, the Republican proposal would stimulate repatriation of some of the funds that have been accumulated abroad, as well as increased inflows of future foreign profits. What does all this mean for the budget deficit? The CBO estimates that the deficit will rise from 3.4% of gross domestic product to more than 4% over the next 10 years, even with no change in tax rules. The direct impact of lowering tax rates on personal income and corporate profits will be to reduce tax revenue and increase the budget deficit. But this will be offset by limits on personal tax deductions and exclusions, and the lower tax rates on personal income will boost taxable incomes as individuals increase earnings and compensation shifts from fringe benefits to taxable cash. Likewise, the move to a territorial tax system will raise taxable profits, especially in the short term, as companies repatriate some of the existing stock of overseas funds. Although the net tax changes may widen the budget deficit in the short term, the incentive effects of lower tax rates and the increased accumulation of capital will mean faster economic growth and higher real incomes, both of which will cause rising taxable incomes and lower long-term deficits. There is an important legislative reason why the projected budget will return to surplus in the future. The Republicans have only a very small majority in the Senate, where the filibuster rule requires a three-fifths majority to pass most legislation, giving the Democrats the ability to block the Republican tax agenda. But an exception allows tax and spending bills to be passed with a simple majority if the resulting budget returns to surplus after 10 years. By designing the tax and spending rules accordingly and phasing in future revenue increases, the Republicans can achieve the needed long-term surpluses. As a result, I am optimistic that a tax reform serving to increase capital formation and growth will be enacted, and that any resulting increase in the budget deficit will be only temporary.

31,Myra P. Saefong,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 31, 2017 7:49 p.m. ET 1 million barrels of oil can produce half a million barrels of gasoline By U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry authorized an emergency release of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Thursday in an effort to ease shortages of gasoline in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but analysts doubt it will have much impact. I authorized the SPR to execute an emergency exchange agreement authorizing crude oil to be drawn down from @ENERGY site. #Harvey Statement: pic.twitter.com/9TQXwiQfmd Perry first authorized a release of 500,000 barrels of crude oil from the emergency oil reserve early Thursday. A spokeswoman said it would be delivered directly by pipeline directly to the Phillips 66 refinery in Lake Charles, La. “This is a drop in the bucket,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. It “won’t do much” and while it will be enough oil for two days of operations, “we need the Port of Houston to open to make a notable difference.” On Thursday afternoon, the Energy Department announced the release of another 500,000 barrels of oil from the reserve, taking the total release to 1 million barrels. “Hurricane Harvey has been far more devastating for U.S. energy infrastructure than anyone could have imagined even a week ago,” said Dave Ernsberger, global head of energy at S&P Global Platts. He said the SPR is “often criticized in the industry because it usually ends up offering to provide more crude, on an emergency basis, when what the market really needs is refined products like gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.” But “the scale of the storm is so massive that this could be the first time in a long time when crude supplies might be increasingly tapped in to,” said Ernsberger. “No crude vessels have called into Houston [ports] for five days, and it might be quite some time before they do again.” So let’s do the math: U.S. refineries produced an average of about 20 gallons of motor gasoline and about of 11 gallons of ultralow sulfur distillate fuel oil from one 42-gallon barrel of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. Many other petroleum products are refined from crude oil. But if you look at just gasoline, that 1 million barrels of oil would produce about half a million barrels of gasoline, according to James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics. The amount of oil could feed refinery operations for around 4 days and “make enough gasoline to fuel U.S. autos for an hour and 15 minutes,” he said. In 2016, U.S. drivers consumed about 143.37 billion gallons, or about 3.41 billion barrels, of finished motor gasoline, according to the EIA, a daily average of about 391.73 million gallons, or 9.33 million barrels. At the retail level, the average price per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline stood at $2.482 late Thursday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. That’s up 13 cents from last week’s average. Read: Why September’s gasoline futures contract has left October’s in the dust The SPR release shows that refineries still in operation are having a hard time finding crude, or at least the grade of crude they need, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. “With refining margins soaring, refiners are going to be paying up to get their hands on crude,” he said. Many domestic and international refiners will be putting off maintenance, helping drive demand for crude. If gasoline prices continue to soar, “crude prices will be dragged higher.” On Thursday, October West Texas Intermediate crude

32,Chris Edelson,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 24, 2017 11:58 a.m. ET U.S. business leaders should call for the president to resign By In ordinary times, it would be a mistake to expect CEOs to take a national leadership role during political crisis. CEOs are risk-averse and rarely see any upside to weighing in publicly on political debate. But these are not ordinary times. CEOs already see that the biggest risk for them when it comes to President Donald Trump is failing to act. The blowback from the Charlottesville, Va. violence and the resultant implosion of Trump’s business councils shows that CEOs can play a pivotal role by taking a stand against the president. With the United States facing what Republican Senator Ben Sasse described — back in March —  as a “civilization-warping crisis of public trust,” business titans have already displayed backbone by rebuking the president in the days since Charlottesville. They can do more. CEOs have had to act because of public demand and because the Republican-controlled Congress has not. Having taken the important first step of disbanding the White House business councils, the CEOs who have left these councils (and their peers) should now go further and call for Trump's resignation. These former council members are the most important CEOs in the nation — leaders of General Electric

                                   , and more. CEOs need to act in unison, coalescing behind a common statement —  a CEO manifesto — that we provide below. This need not be a pipe dream; After all, the CEOs in the president’s councils not only agreed to disband and resign, but some were also discussing  condemning Trump. GM CEO Mary Barra’s involvement, ironically, harkens back to that classic dictum, uttered in 1953 by then GM CEO Charles Erwin Wilson when GM was the most powerful corporation in America: ""What was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa."" What Barra and other prominent CEOs seem to be saying now is that Trump is not good for the country, and the corollary: that his leadership not good for General Motors or other big U.S. companies. Yet if CEOs instead sit on the sidelines, will future generations see them as complicit in lending support to a president who threatens core American values of morality, democracy, society, and capitalism? American business, however economically motivated, has more of a moral compass than Trump, and in this moment, morality and business considerations overlap. To be sure, some  CEOs opposed Trump early on,   during the presidential campaign. After the inauguration, some CEOs (especially from technology) countered the president  on immigration, signing on to an amicus brief and making public statements.  Other CEOs spoke up  after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. What is needed now is dramatic, decisive, and collective action to save the country from an out-of-control president.  Let’s consider how CEOs might support a manifesto calling for the president’s resignation. Step 1 —  A trigger:  One trigger for action just happened with Trump’s response to Charlottesville; but other triggers are likely in the coming weeks and months. A trigger may also result from the legal inquiries against the president.  And there may be foreign events (the standoff with North Korea); or a stock market downturn. Step 2 — Coalesce and confer:  We know that such gatherings, via conference calls, took place  soon after Charlottesville. The largest density of CEOs is in the Business Roundtable, which is aligned with Trump’s deregulation and tax reduction agenda.The Roundtable is led by JPMorgan Chase CEO

Bearish near-term price action. To reiterate, an eventual close atop the breakdown point would place the S&P on firmer technical ground. Conversely, first support (2,437) is followed by a firmer floor matching the August low (2,417). Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is traversing a near-term range. In its case, first support (21,770) is followed by a firmer floor matching the breakout point (21,682) better illustrated on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s price action remains technical. Consider that the prevailing range top closely matches the late-June peak (6,303) also illustrated below. Slightly more broadly, the Nasdaq continues to range around the 50-day moving average, currently 6,281. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq’s August price action remains jagged, capped by the 6,342 breakdown point. An eventual close higher would neutralize the early-month downdraft. Separately, the Nasdaq has staged an extended late-August retest of the 50-day moving average. Combined, the bearish late-July reversal, subsequent failed retest of the 6,342 resistance, and more recent sluggishness at the 50-day moving average, constitute a bearish-leaning near- to intermediate-term backdrop. Looking elsewhere, the Dow industrials’ backdrop remains stronger. The blue-chip benchmark has thus far maintained the breakout point (21,682) a level matching the 50-day moving average, currently 21,684. This area has drawn buyers early Tuesday. Conversely, last week’s high (21,912) closely matched the 20-day moving average, a level that has capped the Dow since Aug. 17. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has failed a headline technical test — at least so far. Specifically, the S&P has registered five straight session highs closely matching the 2,453 resistance, without closing higher. Recall that the flatlining 50-day moving average, currently 2,451, effectively matches resistance. Broadly speaking, the August consolidation phase remains underway against a persistently uneven technical backdrop. On a headline basis, the Nasdaq Composite has stalled near the 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 remains capped by well-documented overhead.

As always, the 200-day is a widely-tracked longer-term trending indicator, and a posture lower raises the flag to a potential primary trend shift. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is vacillating at the 200-day moving average, currently 311.35. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising from three-month lows — following a tandem violation of the 200-day moving average — and the rally attempt has thus far been flat. Bearish price action. An eventual rally atop the trending indicators would mark technical progress. All told, the U.S. benchmarks continue to digest the year’s most technically damaging downdraft. (To be sure, the 2017 uptrend has been so strong that it presents a low bar for a downturn to register as the year’s most damaging.) The downturn has been relatively broadly-based, and fueled by increased volume, contributing to the violation of several key technical levels. Recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have ventured under the 200-day moving average, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have violated major support, and failed the initial retest from underneath. By comparison, the August rally attempts have registered as flat. At least so far. Tactically, the S&P 500’s headline 2,453 resistance closely matches the 50-day moving average, and a close higher would mark technical progress. The recent extended retest, from underneath, has thus far drawn selling pressure. Conversely, S&P 2,405 matches important support, as initially detailed Aug. 18. An eventual violation would mark an intermediate-term “lower low” raising the flag to more serious technical concerns. Beyond the prevailing intermediate-term consolidation phase, the S&P 500’s more important primary uptrend is intact.

Consider that major support spans from 2.10 to 2.12, levels matching the June low and the bottom of the November gap. This area is under siege early Tuesday, and the retest remains a “watch out.” To reiterate, a sustained break lower places the yield in less-charted territory, leaving it vulnerable to potentially material downside follow-through.

That performance has been led by a three-fold increase in earnings by energy companies benefiting from higher oil prices. The technology sector has also been a big driver, rising 21%. Any company’s earnings results can be skewed by accounting adjustments and one-time items. So we thought it would provide food for thought for stock pickers to look at companies that had significantly increased their sales per share, while also being rated highly by analysts. We focused on sales per share, rather than raw revenue numbers, because the per-share numbers account for any dilution from the issuance of shares for any reason (including stock-based compensation packages for executives), while also reflecting any declines in share counts from stock buybacks. Also see: This could be the perfect time to buy shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron First, we identified the 169 companies in the S&P 500 that had increased sales per share by at least 10% in the past year from the prior 12-month period.

          Updated Aug 29, 2017 11:06 AM EDT As Hurricane Harvey continues to pound the Gulf Coast as a tropical storm, drivers across the U.S. are bracing for the impact on their wallets. Gasoline costs already edging up following the most destructive storm since Hurricane Sandy in 2012 -- and analysts said prices at the pump are likely to rise between 5 cents and 15 cents nationwide in the weeks ahead. The national average price for a gallon of gas rose to $2.37 on Tuesday, according to AAA. That's a 4-cent increase from the previous week, and the most gas has cost since June 2. Indiana, Ohio, Florida and Michigan saw the largest week-over-week price jumps. One reason for that increase is that Harvey is disrupting fuel supplies. Many oil refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Galveston, Texas, closed Friday ahead of the storm and remained shut through Monday. That has lowered the country's refining capacity by 3 million gallons a day, or about one-sixth of the total, said Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service. ""It's still really early to tell what this is going to mean for long-term supply,"" he said. ""If some of these refineries are flooded, it's going to take weeks to get the water out of there and then get into damage assessment."" Even though the high winds and seawater surge from the storm have abated, the rain is expected to keep falling in the Houston area until at least Thursday, with some areas getting up to 50 inches of rain. That also puts refineries at risk. ""As the amount of rain continues to add up, there's more and more risk that there could be water damage, especially to storage facilities and underground pipelines,"" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. DeHaan predicted that the storm would add about 15 cents per gallon to the cost of oil; Cinquegrana put the increase at 5 to 10 cents. By comparison, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which struck Louisiana and Texas in 2005, caused a 40 cent jump in gas prices. Another factor cushioning the blow somewhat is that the country's production of gas is near a 10-year peak, with oil stocks last week reaching 463 million barrels. If the crunch continues, consumers can expect to see unbranded gas stations -- those that don't carry the name of a petroleum company, like Exxon or Shell -- to run out first, Cinquegrana said. Those distribution channels are cut off first if there is a gas shortage; because of that, they also tend to be the first to increase their prices slightly. But not all areas of the country will feel the costs equally. The Midwest, in particular, is likely to see prices jump by about 25 cents a gallon later in the week, DeHaan said. In Missouri and Illinois, average gas prices from Monday to Tuesday rose by 7 and 9 cents, respectively. That stems from what is known as price cycling, where competing gas stations gradually lower their prices and then reset them mid-week. ""Harvey has pushed that price cycling to occur sooner than it usually does,"" he said. Spots in the Northeast are also seeing trouble, OPIS said. Valero, a major oil refiner based in San Antonio, Texas, shut off shipments of unbranded petroleum to about 20 terminals in the northeast, OPIS reported, causing prices at some stations to jump 7 or 8 cents. (Valero did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) The Houston area itself might not see a long-term increase in gas prices, putting aside examples of isolated stations hiking prices in the storm's aftermath. That's because the extreme flooding is expected to deter driving over the coming weeks. Once the water recedes, the municipal repair and reconstruction necessary for residents to start driving again can take months -- far longer that it will likely take for the oil refineries to come back online. ""Storms like this tend to have much longer implications for [gasoline] demand than supply,"" Cinquegrana said. A decade after the Great Recession, the U.S. economy still hasn't made up the ground it lost The top-paying jobs tend to cluster in two industries -- and may prove less vulnerable automation Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

It is unclear if a jump in gasoline prices is long-lasting because we don’t know how soon refineries will be up and running,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading.

At the close, 2.61 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.54 billion trading on the Nasdaq. Trading volumes were especially light last week, coming in below already seasonally low August averages. Daily average trading volume in August for the NYSE stands at 3.09 billion shares and 1.79 billion shares for the Nasdaq, according to Dow Jones data. “Unless we hit some macro[economic] issues, we’re in a little bit of a lull,” said Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW, in an interview. “Earnings are still lending strength to the overall tone of the market, and people were thinking something would come out of Jackson Hole but nothing happened, so it’s business as usual.” Jaffee said attention is more focused on company specifics, such as Gilead Sciences Inc.

Now a tropical storm, Harvey devastated Houston, the fourth-largest city in the U.S., leaving its citizens grappling with unprecedented flooding. The National Weather Service warned that rainfall may exceed a record-breaking 50 inches in areas around Houston. The storm, which was moving toward Louisiana on Monday, knocked out almost 15% of the nation’s fuel-making capacity and further disruptions were anticipated. The coast of Texas hosts nearly 30% of U.S. refining capacity, and Houston-area plants account for roughly half of that.

                                   cancer vaccine platform “could overcome issues that have plagued the field of therapeutic cancer vaccines in the past,” Chang said, because its approach “mimics the natural generation of protective immunity.” One of the company’s vaccine platforms, ZVex, “‘primes’ the immune system by in vivo targeting of dendritic cells that leads to optimal antigen presentation and production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),” while the other platform, GLAAS, “can further ‘boost’ the immune response by expanding and enhancing the function of CTLs,” Chang said. CMB305, which was developed using ZVex, targets an antigen that’s expressed in many kinds of tumors, according to Immune Design. It’s being studied as a combination in a mid-stage trial for soft tissue sarcoma and on its own in an early-stage trial for solid tumors, Chang said. Related:  Lifestyle gets blame for 70% to 90% of all cancers and 4 lifestyle changes to reduce your cancer risk Another vaccine, G100, was developed using GLAAS and is being studied in an early/midstage trial on its own and in combination for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, according to Chang. Immune Design is also studying the ZVex and GLAAS platforms in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, he said, referring to a class of cancer drugs that work on the immune system. New research results expected in the second half of this year and in 2018, including mid-stage trial results expected by a Sept. 11 cancer conference, could lift the company’s stock, Chang said. He rates the company outperform with a $18 price target. The first vaccine to treat cancer, Provenge, was approved for some men with metastatic prostate cancer in 2010. At the time, it was considered a major advance in cancer research. But the expensive product — which cost $93,000 for a course of treatment that improves patient survival by more than four months — didn’t sell as well as its then-owner, Dendreon, expected.

38,,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc said on Wednesday that it will offer Obamacare plans in only about half of the counties in Kentucky next year, after covering the whole state in 2017. The insurer said it will offer the healthcare plans in 59 counties in the state in 2018. It said all 120 counties in Kentucky will still have a carrier offering plans next year. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty about healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seeks to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. But other insurers, including Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into counties that had lost their coverage options. Every U.S. county is currently projected to have at least one insurer offering Obamacare individual coverage next year. Still, 1,487 counties could have only one insurer in 2018. ","

39,,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s new gene-modifying cancer therapy’s $475,000-per-patient sticker price has drawn fire from advocate groups calling for cheaper drugs, but analysts said the Swiss drugmaker could initially struggle to break even. In a first for gene therapy in the United States, regulators approved Kymriah on Wednesday for patients up to 25 years of age who have relapsed or not been helped by previous treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While patient groups hailed the potent immunotherapy as a potential cancer game-changer, the Swiss drugmaker was also criticized for setting a price that places Kymriah among the most-expensive drugs ever. It trails only a couple of gene therapies for ulta-rare diseases. Since taxpayers have chipped in more than $200 million over the years for related research — much early work on the drug was done at the University of Pennsylvania — Novartis should have used more restraint, the Patients for Affordable Drugs lobby group said. “We believe it is excessive,” said David Mitchell, a cancer patient who founded the group. “Novartis should not get credit for bringing a $475,000 drug to market and claiming they could have charged people a lot more.” Novartis estimates that only 600 ALL patients a year would be eligible for Kymriah, making the initial pool for the treatment relatively scarce and worth less than $300 million. The company is also targeting the several thousand people a year who have relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) diagnosed, but it will not file Kymriah for that group until later this year. BREAK-EVEN POINT? Success with those patients is key to Novartis turning Kymriah into the $1 billion-a-year blockbuster drug the Swiss company predicts it will eventually become, but analysts say it is anyone’s guess when it will start covering its costs. “It is not clear what the break-even point for profitability is, as this is a very capital intensive endeavor,” said Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson, adding that Novartis is likely to cut the price of Kymriah for DLBCL patients. On Thursday Novartis said that its cost of goods per Kymriah treatment is confidential commercial information, but analysts estimate it could be as high as $200,000. The process is complex. Doctors remove T cells from each cancer victim and ship the material to its factory in Morris Plains, New Jersey. After re-engineering them to attack cancer, frozen cells are returned a couple weeks later for reinfusion into patients. Additionally, Novartis partner Oxford BioMedica, which supplies a key ingredient, may be due $100 million over the next three years, plus royalties on sales. Furthermore, competition is on the horizon. Gilead Sciences this week announced an $11.9 billion deal to buy Kite Pharma to gain access to a similar drug, while Bluebird Bio and Juno Therapeutics are all working on their own CAR-T therapies. While Kymriah’s price tag will grab headlines, it pales in comparison with some other gene therapy treatments. For instance, UniQure’s Glybera, for a very rare blood disorder, runs at about $1 million per patient. Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline’s Strimvelis, for so-called “bubble boy” disease, comes in at about $700,000 per patient. Novartis points out that some groups think the company could actually have charged more for Kymriah. British health authorities, for instance, had said that up to $650,000 might have been justified if the treatment added years to children’s lives. Novartis plans to charge insurers and payers only when the drug proves to be effective one month into treatment, a so-called “outcome-based” pricing scheme that puts some of the risk of the drug on its manufacturer. Even so, analysts hardly expect that to shield Novartis from criticism. “Expect turbulent public discussions on drug pricing, demonstrating that the road to hell is paved with good intentions,” said Bruno Bulic of equity research firm Baader Helvea. Bulic forecasts that Kymriah will start adding to Novartis’s bottom line only after 2019, when it is expected to be given to more patient groups. ","

40,,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"Reuters Health - The percentage of U.S. adults under age 65 who skip essential prescription drugs because of price has declined, a five-year study found. But consistently, problems with financial access to medication were more common in cancer survivors. “Spending on prescription drugs to treat cancer has been increasing in the United States, and many newer cancer drugs have annual price tags of $100,000 or more,” study co-author K. Robin Yabroff told Reuters Health in an email. Patient cost-sharing has also been increasing in recent years, she noted. And there have been significant changes in financial hardship due to costs of prescription drugs between 2011 and 2015, said Yabroff, who is a researcher with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC. Multiple studies have shown that cancer survivors are more likely to have high out-of-pocket spending for health care and be worried about their medical bills than those without a cancer history, said Yabroff. “In this study, we wanted to examine changes in financial access to prescription drugs over time and whether any changes differed for cancer survivors,” she said. As reported in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, online August 24, Yabroff’s team analyzed data on nearly 200,000 adults who participated in the National Health Interview Survey. In 2010, almost 14% of cancer survivors ages 18 to 64 said they had forgone needed prescription drugs because of cost during the previous 12 months, compared to 11% of their peers without a history of cancer. By 2015, those rates were down for both groups but were still higher for cancer survivors, at roughly 9%, than for those without a cancer history, at just under 7%. In each of the six years studied, cancer survivors were more likely to report forgoing prescription drugs in the past year because of cost, Yabroff said. Cancer survivors were also more likely to be older and have more chronic conditions than those without a cancer history, and both of these characteristics may be associated with greater need for prescription drugs, said Yabroff. But even after the researchers took age and chronic medical problems into account, cancer survivors were still more likely to report limited financial access to prescription medications, she said. For adults 65 or older, a cancer history did not seem to affect financial access to medications. The vast majority of U.S. adults in that age group, however, are insured with Medicare, which may minimize barriers to financial access to prescription drugs, Yabroff added. Going forward, Yabroff said, it will be important to study why cancer survivors are more likely to forgo prescription drugs because of cost and whether skipping those drugs is associated with more emergency room visits or potentially avoidable hospitalizations. “A number of factors will likely play a role in financial access to prescription drugs in the future, including economic trends, the price of prescription drugs, level of patient cost-sharing, and type of health insurance coverage. It will be important to continue to evaluate trends in financial access to prescription drugs,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2vxEPy6 J Natl Cancer Inst 2017. ","

41,,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Wayne Rooney’s international days are now behind him but Marcus Rashford offered ample evidence that he could follow in the footsteps of England’s record goalscorer with a match-winning display against Slovakia on Monday. Almost 14 years to the day since a 17-year-old Rooney scored the first of his 53 England goals in a European Championship qualifier against Macedonia, 19-year-old Rashford bagged his first competitive strike for his country in stunning fashion. Receiving the ball from England skipper Jordan Henderson 25 metres out there was only one thought in the Manchester United striker’s head as he looked up and lashed an unstoppable low shot past Slovakia keeper Martin Dubravka in the 59th minute. It earned England a 2-1 victory that had looked unlikely when Rashford’s mistake allowed Slovakia to take a shock third-minute lead at Wembley in the Group F World Cup qualifier. England now look set to qualify for next year’s finals in Russia and Rashford, who is also hoping to fill Rooney’s boots at Old Trafford after his return to boyhood club Everton, will surely be a major part of manager Gareth Southgate’s plans. “He is so mature,” Southgate, whose decision to start Rashford rather than Raheem Sterling was vindicated, told reporters. “The start surprised me. But he is never in awe of the occasion. He doesn’t fear anything. “He is still a work in progress as we saw at the beginning of the game. He is still getting stronger and his impact taking people on and getting us up the pitch is huge. “It’s early for Marcus so we have to keep things in perspective. He is exciting.” Livewire Rashford combined well with Harry Kane and Dele Alli on occasions and his pace and skill continually stretched Slovakia’s defence and allowed England to regain some control after a dreadful opening 35 minutes. The striker, who marked his club debut in 2016 with two goals in a Europa League tie to become United’s youngest scorer in European competition and then scored two on his Premier League debut against Arsenal days later, was named man of the match on Monday and was cheered as he was replaced late on. Apart from his winner he also set up Eric Dier’s 37th minute equaliser with a corner and forced Dubravka to make a great save before halftime. “Marcus Rashford’s night? It wasn’t so good to begin with but it got better.” Dier said. “A fantastic show of character, after making a mistake, to score the winner which got us closer to the World Cup where hopefully he will shine.” Rashford’s contribution glossed over another patchy England display that would have been punished by teams with more quality than Slovakia who now face a battle with Scotland and Slovenia to finish as runners-up and qualify for a playoff spot. Southgate, however, preferred to focus on the way his side recovered their composure. “We showed resilience and the tactical reaction on the pitch was good to see,” he said. “They are incredibly young and it’s a good experience to go through as long as you win because it starts to build some inner belief. “I’m pleased we controlled the game in the second half. They showed maturity. We didn’t start well, they pressed us well and we weren’t able to cope with that. But we got that right and once we went 2-1 up we were difficult to play through.” ","

42,,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Around 120,000 displaced people - mostly Rohingya Muslims - in camps in Myanmar’s Rakhine state are not receiving food supplies or healthcare after the U.N. and aid groups suspended operations following government accusations of supporting insurgents. Nearly 400 people have died in fighting in the far north of the state after Rohingya militants attacked police posts and an army base a week ago, provoking a major army counteroffensive. The impact from the conflict has now spread, including to the state capital Sittwe further south, where some 90,000 Rohingya have lived in camps since an outbreak of communal violence rocked the city in 2012, killing nearly 200 people. A further 30,000 Rohingya are housed in camps elsewhere in the state, while a small number of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists displaced in the 2012 violence also live in separate camps. “As a result of the disruption of activities in central Rakhine state, many people are currently not receiving their normal food assistance and primary healthcare services have been severely disrupted,” said Pierre Peron, a spokesman for the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The U.N. and international aid groups had already evacuated all “non-critical” staff from the north of the state amid intensifying fighting and after the office of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi repeatedly published pictures of World Food Programme (WFP) energy biscuits allegedly found at an insurgent camp. Suu Kyi’s office also said it was investigating aid groups’ support for the insurgents in one incident. Now contractors working for the WFP, a U.N. agency, have refused to carry food to the camps in Sittwe and elsewhere. Staff with international aid groups who run clinics inside the large, densely populated camps have also been afraid to show up for work, leading to the closure of facilities, U.N. sources and aid workers told Reuters. Local staff were afraid of being intimidated by Rakhine Buddhist hardliners, and some worried about being attacked by Muslims, the sources said. Sanitation is also a major problem - contractors cleaning latrines in the camps have also refused to work and the latrines are overflowing in the monsoon rains, increasing the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases, they said. The treatment of Myanmar’s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya, who have long complained of persecution in Buddhist majority Myanmar, is the biggest challenge facing Suu Kyi. The top U.N. human rights official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, has criticized Suu Kyi’s office for “irresponsible” suggestions that aid agencies may have assisted Rohingya militants calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). “#WFP Aid & #ARSA terrorists : #Myanmar Govt asking #WFP, Aid for civilian or terrorists? #Rakhine #Myanmar,” said Suu Kyi’s spokesman, Zaw Htay, in a tweet on Thursday. Tin Maung Swe, secretary of the Rakhine state government, confirmed that workers have refused to work for the WFP. “Laborers who carry the WFP food bags don’t want to contract with them any more. People who have made contract with WFP refused to work for them,” he said. He added that residents were “disgusted” with the organization following the government’s accusations. Tin Maung Swe also said that the government was trying to find “a different way to support the organization”. Rakhine Buddhist leaders have long bemoaned the presence of international agencies, who they accuse of favoring the Rohingya. Aid offices in Sittwe were sacked during 2014 riots. The discovery at a suspected militant camp on July 30 of WFP-branded biscuits intended for malnourished children had further stoked tensions even before last week’s attacks. Accusations against the U.N. have been spread on social media by nationalist hardliners, stoking fears of another outbreak of communal violence in a state that has long been divided along religious and ethnic lines. International aid agencies operating in Myanmar issued a statement on Thursday condemning the insurgent attacks and subsequent violence, and urging “all stakeholders to cease the spread of misinformation”. The OCHA’s Peron said the disruption was already being felt. “Humanitarian aid normally goes to these vulnerable people for a very good reason, because they depend on it,” he said. In addition to the closure of camp clinics, Rohingya who have been referred to the main hospital in Sittwe for more serious complaints were finding it hard to travel there, said the hospital’s chief doctor Kyaw Naing Win. “There have been some constraints for them to come to the hospital because of the tighter security control after recent clashes,” he said, but added the hospital did not discriminate against them. Kyaw Naing Win said he arranged for the state government to provide security for 17 Muslim patients who were discharged from the hospital on Thursday. Even before the recent violence Rohingya camp residents faced severe restrictions on their movements around Sittwe. Talks between government and relief agencies are scheduled for next week, aid group sources told Reuters. Possible solutions might include the government providing security escorts for food convoys, they added. (This story has been refiled to remove extraneous words in paragraph 6) ","

43,,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advanced hackers have targeted United States and European energy companies in a cyber espionage campaign that has in some cases successfully broken into the core systems that control the companies’ operations, according to researchers at the security firm Symantec. Malicious email campaigns have been used to gain entry into organizations in the United States, Turkey and Switzerland, and likely other countries well, Symantec said in a report published on Wednesday. The cyber attacks, which began in late 2015 but increased in frequency in April of this year, are probably the work of a foreign government and bear the hallmarks of a hacking group known as Dragonfly, Eric Chien, a cyber security researcher at Symantec, said in an interview. The research adds to concerns that industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, are susceptible to cyber attacks that could be leveraged for destructive purposes in the event of a major geopolitical conflict. In June the U.S. government warned industrial firms about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, saying in an alert seen by Reuters that hackers sent phishing emails to harvest credentials in order to gain access to targeted networks. Chien said he believed that alert likely referenced the same campaign Symantec has been tracking. He said dozens of companies had been targeted and that a handful of them, including in the United States, had been compromised on the operational level. That level of access meant that motivation was “the only step left” preventing “sabotage of the power grid,” Chien said. However, other researchers cast some doubt on the findings. While concerning, the attacks were “far from the level of being able to turn off the lights, so there’s no alarmism needed,” said Robert M. Lee, founder of U.S. critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc, who read the report. Lee called the connection to Dragonfly “loose.” Dragonfly was previously active from around to 2011 to 2014, when it appeared to go dormant after several cyber firms published research exposing its attacks. The group, also known as Energetic Bear or Koala, was widely believed by security experts to be tied to the Russian government.

45, ,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Cholera has broken out in northeast Nigeria at a camp for people displaced by the eight year conflict with Boko Haram, aid group Médecins Sans Frontières said on Thursday, bringing disease to communities already underfed and living in squalor. The outbreak in the city of Maiduguri, the epicenter of the fight against the Islamist insurgents, confirms aid groups’ fears that Nigeria’s rainy season could spread disease in camps for the internally displaced that are often already unsanitary. About 1.8 million have abandoned their homes because of violence or food shortages, U.N. agencies say, and many of them live in camps for the displaced throughout northeast Nigeria, particularly in Maiduguri and the surrounding state of Borno. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, is increasing its “efforts to prevent further deaths and the spread of cholera in Maiduguri”, the group said. MSF said it had set up a 40-bed cholera treatment unit, which has admitted 70 patients, mostly from the Muna Garage camp. “Following heavy rains, the camp is partly flooded, making the already poor sanitary conditions at the camp even worse, which is an additional risk factor during a cholera outbreak,” MSF said, adding that a potential case has been reported from another part of Maiduguri. “Since last weekend, we have witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients at our treatment center and at the rehydration point in Muna camp,” said Anne-Cecile Niard, MSF project coordinator in the statement. “We are worried that the number of beds that are currently planned will not be enough to cope at the peak of the outbreak.” More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, and 5.2 million people in the northeast do not have secure access to food, with tens of thousands already in famine-like conditions, according to the United Nations.

46, ,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Yolanda Varona is encouraging her children and thousands of other young Mexicans who may lose their right to live in the United States to stay and fight to achieve their American Dream. Varona is the mother of two of the 800,000 people, most of them Mexicans, who could face deportation after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday eliminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme (DACA). DACA gave work permits to people known as “Dreamers” who were brought to the United States illegally as children by immigrants like Varona. Trump scrapped the Obama-era programme, but delayed implementation until March to give Congress a chance to draft an alternative. After Varona was deported in 2010 and separated from her two children in the United States, she set up a chapter of Dreamers’ Moms in the border city of Tijuana. The group, founded in the United States by parents of Dreamers and other activists, has organised legal education workshops for immigrants across the United States. The Tijuana chapter has 80 mothers whose children in the United States could lose the legal protection that originally convinced them to risk registering with the U.S. government to join DACA. “We want them to keep fighting, they can achieve better things there,” Varona said by telephone. “In the unfortunate case that the police arrive to deport them, we will be there to help them.” Varona said Trump’s decision would drive young people to “live in the shadows” again. She stressed how difficult it was for these youths to return to Mexico, where they have lost family ties and sometimes do not speak the language. Some 625,000 young Mexicans are enrolled under DACA. The Mexican government has offered them legal support and help finding work should they be deported from the United States. But many Dreamers fear returning to an unfamiliar, violence-plagued country offering salaries that are a fraction of what they can earn in the United States. Iliana Flores, a 28-year-old Dreamer in San Diego, across the border from Tijuana, said she was afraid of taking her two young, American-born children back to Mexico, where she said they would not receive a good education and would be surrounded by poverty and violence. “I fear for the future of my children there,” she said. Like millions of Mexicans living in the United States, Flores sends part of the U.S. dollars she earns back to her family, who live in Durango, to help them make ends meet. “The situation in Mexico is unfortunately very difficult,” she said. The U.S.-Mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet, with average U.S. wages about five times higher than those in Mexico. Carlos Martinez, a young man who came with his parents to California at the age of 11, said he feared he would expose his two children to rising violence and extortion if he was to return to Mexico. The murder rate in Mexico hit a record high this year, reaching levels not seen in homicide data going back two decades. “To be honest, I’m afraid to live in what was once my country,” Martinez said.

47, ,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"New York (Reuters) - Sports e-commerce firm Fanatics has closed a $1 billion funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp’s Vision fund, which will give it the firepower to expand internationally, Chief Executive Doug Mack told Reuters. The new funding will value the Jacksonville, Florida-based company that runs online sales for the National Basketball Association and the National Football League at $4.5 billion - more than twice the $2 billion in revenue expected this year, the company said. The majority of Fanatics’ business is in the United States where it licenses merchandise and handles e-commerce sales for items such as sports jerseys for teams. It is hoping to expand its revenue in international markets by leveraging SoftBank’s expertise in Asia, Mack said in an interview on Tuesday. Fanatics, which handles online sales for football clubs Manchester United and Real Madrid, currently gains about 10 percent of its sales internationally. “It will definitely grow many-fold from there,” Mack said, referring to international sales. “We’ve only scratched the surface of the global opportunity. Soccer is the world’s No. 1 sport, and then there’s cricket. You’ll see us extend our rights to international leagues.” SoftBank, run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, is making the bulk of its investment in Fanatics out of its $93 billion Vision Fund, the world’s biggest private equity fund, SoftBank confirmed the funding. While the majority of the $1 billion in funding comes from SoftBank, the National Football League and Major League Baseball also participated. SoftBank was introduced to Fanatics by Michael Rubin, the company’s executive chairman who previously founded GSI Commerce, a company that attracted an $100 million investment from SoftBank before it was sold to eBay for $2.4 billion. Fanatics is also looking to hire more engineers, data scientists and designers with the cash. Mack said one of the firm’s strengths lay with its technology that allows it to manufacture clothing very quickly. When Fanatics wanted to raise money for victims of the  devastating Hurricane Harvey, it created a “Houston Strong” line of clothing featuring all of the city’s local sports teams. It took less than three days to design the shirts, get permission from the sports teams and start shipping, Mack said. An initial public offering or sale isn’t on the horizon, Mack said, although the company has been spending on deals. In April, it acquired VF Corporation’s sports licensing group, which owns the Majestic sportswear brand, for $225 million. ","

48, ,9072017,Reuters,8312017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemen’s cholera outbreak has infected 612,703 people and killed 2,048 since it began in April, and some districts are still reporting sharp rises in new cases, data from the World Health Organization and Yemen’s health ministry showed on Tuesday. The overall spread of the epidemic has slowed in the past two months, with the daily number of new suspected cases cut to around 3,000 in recent days. However the epidemic, the most explosive on record in terms of its rapid spread, has continually confounded expectations. Soon after it began, WHO saw a worst-case scenario of 300,000 cases within six months. But by the end of June, WHO was hoping 218,000 cases might be the halfway mark. In late July it said the spread had peaked after infecting 400,000. Epidemics normally decline as quickly as they arise, so the peak of the disease - which is spread by contaminated food and water - should be roughly half the eventual total caseload. But the decline in the epidemic has been bumpy, and the number of new cases rose in two of the past four weeks. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said some of the most affected areas, such as Sanaa City and the governorates of Hajjah and Amran, had seen falls in the numbers of new cases. But there had been a “sudden and significant increase” in the number of suspected cases reported from 12 districts, in the governorates of Hodeidah, Al Jawf, Al Mahwit, Ibb, Dhamar, Al Bayda and Aden. “WHO is currently investigating the reason for this increase. A key aim of the investigation will be to determine whether the numbers are accurate and whether the spike in suspected cases is, in fact, caused by cholera or another diarrhoeal disease like rotavirus,” Jasarevic said. Save the Children, a charity running cholera treatment centres, said last Friday that suspected cases in Hodeidah governorate had jumped by 40 percent in three weeks amid heavy rains and a heatwave, and in some districts weekly caseloads were double their previous peaks. The United Nations has said the epidemic is man-made, driven by a civil war that has left 15.7 million people without clean water or sanitation. ","

49,,9072017,Investopedia,8312017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A subsidy is a benefit given to an individual, business or institution, usually by the government. It is usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy. A subsidy takes the form of a payment, provided directly or indirectly, which provides a concession to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver, or promote a particular action by providing financial support. A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation’s economy. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them, or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy, or may be undercut by activities in rival economies. Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current market rate, resulting in a savings for those the subsidy is designed to help. There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are welfare payments and unemployment benefits.  The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.  Other subsidies, such as student loans, are given to encourage people to further their education. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, a number of U.S. families became eligible for health-care subsidies, based on household income and size. These subsidies are designed to lower the out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household. Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.  Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone towards four industries: agriculture, financial institutions, oil companies and utilities companies. Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies; some are economic, some are political and some come from socio-economic development theory. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit. Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a mixed economy. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies, and by extension, the degree to which an economy should be a mixed one. Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to help support businesses and the jobs they create.  Other economists feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails; if it fails, those resources are allocated to a more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources. Subsidies: The Pros Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the ""socially optimal"" level of goods and services. In contemporary neoclassical economic models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical equilibrium level – an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a ""market failure."" One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being under supplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, the market failure should be corrected. In other words, according to general equilibrium theory, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area: They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels. There are many goods or services that allegedly provide what economists call ""positive externalities."" A positive externality is achieved whenever a transaction between two parties provides an indirect benefit to a third party. Many subsidies are implemented to promote positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. Some theories of development argue that the governments of less-developed countries should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations currently. Subsidies: The Cons Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones. Similar concerns come from those who suggest economic calculation is too inexact and microeconomic models are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim they will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim. Another problem, antagonists say: The act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of regulatory capture and rent-seeking, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to government to shield themselves from competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers. Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, and so creates an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries. There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. Policymakers, however, might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense, but still achieve cultural or political goals. An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the Great Depression. Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both set price floors on agricultural products and paid farmers to not produce. Their policy goal was to stop food prices from falling and to protect small farmers. To this extent, the subsidy was a success. But the economic effect was quite different. Artificially high food prices lowered the standard of living for consumers and forced people to spend more on food than they otherwise would have. Those outside of the farm industry were worse off in absolute economic terms. Sometimes both the economic and political results of a subsidy appears to indicate failure. In 2012 and 2013, the Department of Energy (DOE) gave out more than $60 billion in subsidies to renewable (non-oil-based) forms of energy. The DOE anticipated that oil prices would keep increasing, and jump-starting renewable sources could slow dependence on oil. However, the receiving companies failed to turn a profit and oil prices dropped in 2014. Henry Hazlitt, a mid-20th century American business and financial journalist often remarked that bad economics was concerned with only the visible effects, while good economics looked at both the seen and unseen. Subsidies are a classic example of seen versus unseen. Subsidies have an opportunity cost. Take again that Depression Era agricultural subsidy. It had very visible effects; farmers saw profits rise and hired more workers. The invisible costs included what would have happened with all of those dollars without the subsidy. Money from the subsidies had to be taxed from individual income, and consumers were hit again when they faced higher food prices at the grocery store. ",Subsidy Definition | Investopedia,0.9885

51,Elizabeth Gurdus,9072017,CNBC,8312017,"CNBC's Jim Cramer has been known to take fantasy football way too seriously, and on Thursday, he took it to the next level. ""It's time for me to show my reality, not fantasy, but reality stock team, the one I drafted in my head last night while I was busily putting together what could be a championship Skidaddy Ski team, which, of course, competes in the Mad Money Schlumpadicka league,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Even though Cramer wouldn't dare draft a quarterback first unless he was picking Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, he began with his stock market equivalent: Apple. ""If there's a rap against Brady, it's that he's an immobile passer. The rap against Apple is that it's just mobile. I look at Apple as the greatest consumer products company of all time, just as I look at Brady as the greatest quarterback of all time,"" Cramer said. Then, Cramer went for fleet-footed players, the market equivalents of six-foot-five wide receivers who aren't afraid of some traffic. He chose the stocks of Amazon, Netflix and Nvidia. Cramer said that Amazon is a winner in a number of ways — a flex play — with Amazon Web Services consistently delivering points and the retail business bringing the heat. ""I keep waiting for another player to have an answer to Amazon. There isn't one,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host pegged Netflix as the ""Odell Beckham Jr. of companies"" because it easily makes one-handed catches and each production ends up as a touchdown. ""Classic, value-oriented investors don't like the style of Netflix; too unorthodox, too showboat. But I don't care how a player acts off the field. Netflix is on a whole 'nother plane, a winner which consistently breaks out when you least expect it to,"" Cramer said. His last wide receiver would be Nvidia, a red-hot semiconductor stock with ties to the video game industry, autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and voice technology. ""It's tough to keep Nvidia down,"" Cramer said, pointing to the stock's bounce after what Wall Street saw as a weaker-than-expected quarter. ""Like all great receivers, Nvidia's shaken off the drop and is headed back toward an all-time high."" Alphabet and Facebook were Cramer's choices for running backs because even though their stocks seem overvalued, investors won't regret paying those prices later, he said. Despite Alphabet's recent struggles, Cramer said there was still hope for its stock to break out and urged investors not to give up on the opportunity to buy shares of the Google parent. ""Facebook's a stud. I don't even know if there's an analogue in the NFL as I've never seen anything like this company,"" Cramer said. ""Facebook's one of those backs that gets all-purpose yards for doing nothing but being a platform for two billion people. No NFL player has ever had that kind of pull."" Cramer chose Boeing, the strongest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial average, as his defense play because the aerospace giant simply won't quit. For a tight end, the ""Mad Money"" host went with UnitedHealth. ""Why UNH? Because great tight ends not only catch, they block,"" he said. ""I think that Optum, its amazing data business, is the authority on catching — what's flawed in the system, that is — and nobody blocks wasteful costs like UnitedHealth. They should call UNH 'Gronk.' Got me?"" Cramer's kicker draft was the stock of Visa, a financial technology company that he said is the most consistent of any of its competitors. And for his bench, he'd have Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba as a back-up quarterback, and stocks like Celgene, Autodesk, 3M or Honeywell as additional flex players. ""As you can see, this is a team that's built for the ages, not just built for the season. Yes, it's a bullish team, I acknowledge that. It's not as defensive as some would like. You can keep some cash on the sidelines for a decline,"" Cramer said. ""But if you wanted a playoff-ready team of stocks, it is this one, and it's seasoned, it's ready, it's stacked, it's loaded and it's in total beast mode."" Questions for Cramer?

52,Dan Mangan,9072017,CNBC,8312017,"The CEO of a herpes vaccine company at the center of a controversy over an offshore clinical trial on Friday said that future testing of the drug will follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight rules, as demanded by a new group of financial backers that includes venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In an impassioned interview, Rational Vaccines Chief Agustin Fernandez said he feared the great promise of the vaccine developed by the late university professor William Halford was being overshadowed by criticism over Halford's decision to test the drug using American patients on the West Indian nation of St. Kitts and Nevis without monitoring by the FDA or an institutional review board (IRB), as is traditional. ""I just need to defend my friend, who is dead,"" Fernandez told CNBC. ""Your kids will not know herpes, your grandkids will not know herpes because of Bill."" ""People are missing the story here. They're defaming a dead scientist, [who] is really a hero,"" said Fernandez, a Hollywood movie producer who co-founded Rational Vaccines with Halford in 2015 out of a shared desire to help herpes sufferers. As many as 1 in every 6 people between the ages of 14 and 49 has genital herpes, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This guy is eradicating herpes: Let's talk about that,"" he said of Halford, a Southern Illinois University professor who died in June of brain cancer. ""Nobody's saying that we've lost one of the greatest scientific minds in America."" Fernandez spoke two days after health regulators in St. Kitts said they were investigating the 2016 vaccine trial after learning it was conducted in that nation without prior approval. ""The Ministry of Health will always ensure that all research involving human participants follow international standards, which protect the safety and security of persons involved,"" regulators said. Rational Vaccines last October announced that its ""potentially revolutionary Theravax vaccine"" had achieved groundbreaking results in its Phase 1 clinical trial. Fernandez said the trial had shown the drug's promise both as a vaccine that would prevent herpes infections and as a therapeutic treatment to alleviate the often painful outbreak of sores that people with herpes can suffer. Fernandez also said that he now understands it is necessary from now on to conduct further trials following FDA oversight standards if Rational Vaccines hopes to market the vaccine in the United States. ""As a businessman, and as my investors [require] ... we need the FDA,"" Fernandez said. Fernandez, who is not a scientist or an expert on pharmaceuticals, said he did not know at the time that Halford's decision to conduct that trial of the vaccine in St. Kitts in 2016 with 20 American patients would end up drawing the ire of medical ethicists. Nor did Fernandez know, he said, that it was traditional for such drug trials to be monitored either by the FDA or by an institutional review board. ""I didn't know what an IRB was,"" Fernandez said. But he said that this past spring — about six months after the first trial was concluded — when Halford and he met with Thiel's representative to discuss Thiel investing in the vaccine's development, the representative ""yelled"" at Halford for arguing that his decision to do the testing without FDA monitoring was motivated by a desire to help herpes sufferers without unnecessary delay. Thiel's rep ""said, 'We want to help people too, but we want to help a billion people, and we need to go through the FDA,' "" Fernandez recalled. The PayPal co-founder Thiel and a group of other investors committed $7 million to Rational Vaccines on Aug. 23, with the condition that future testing of the vaccine comply with FDA standards, Fernandez said. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC, himself invested $4 million, according to Fernandez. Last Sunday, a story by Kaiser Health News focused on Thiel's investment and highlighted the fact that the 2016 trial ""did not rely on traditional U.S. safety oversight."" The article noted that ""Thiel has been a vocal critic of the FDA, claiming in an interview that its approval process was so unwieldy 'you would not be able to invent the polio vaccine today.'"" Jonathan Zenilman, chief of the infectious disease division of Johns Hopkins Medical Center, told Kaiser Health News, referring to the vaccine trial, ""What they're doing is patently unethical."" ""There's a reason why researchers rely on these protections,"" Zenilman said. ""People can die."" An FDA spokeswoman told CNBC, ""The FDA does not comment on individual cases or speculate on hypothetical situations."" ""However, generally speaking, the FDA believes that the oversight of clinical investigations, including review by an IRB, is critically important and notes it is a regulatory requirement for clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations,"" the spokeswoman said. But Fernandez told CNBC, ""I wasn't aware of an ethical problem then, and I'm not aware of an ethical problem now."" Asked why Halford decided to do the clinical tests without traditional monitoring, Fernandez said, ""The truth is, only Dr. Halford can answer that."" Fernandez speculated that Halford, who was terminally ill for years, was trying to help a number of herpes sufferers, particularly after being asked for help from two such people who ended up committing suicide. ""I'm suggesting that he, in his conscience, felt that he would move as quickly as possible and not have another death on his head,"" Fernandez said. ""He was fighting cancer the entire time,"" Fernandez said. ""He knew he was never going to make a dime from this."" ""Whatever Bill did, he did for the greater good."" Fernandez said Halford told participants in the trial that the trial was not approved by the FDA and required them to each sign an informed consent form to participate. ""The narrative that is out there is that this guy duped some people into getting injections and they are victims,"" Fernandez said. ""And that is not the case."" Fernandez said that all of the participants in the trial were suffering from chronic herpes outbreaks, and a number of them were suffering outbreaks even while taking the herpes treatment drug Valtrex. One of those participants, a 48-year-old truck driver from New Jersey named Richard Mancuso, told CNBC that he had sought to participate in the trial after suffering from two to three herpes outbreaks every month for the prior 20 years. Mancuso said he was interviewed by Halford for three hours before Halford agreed to admit him to the trial, and that the professor told him that ""you really have to think about this seriously, because there are risks involved, this is an experimental vaccine, and I cannot make any promise."" ""He was really clear what the situation was,"" Mancuso said of Halford. Mancuso told CNBC on Friday that he did not recall Halford informing him that FDA or IRB monitoring was traditional for a clinical trial. However, after this article first appeared, he said he had confirmed that disclosure was on the consent form that Halford had him sign before admitting him to the trial. Mancuso received three injections during separate visits to St. Kitts. He said his outbreaks began tapering off, and that he last had an outbreak on March 27. ""Oh, my God, he gave me my life back,"" said Mancuso when asked what he thought of Halford. ""It doesn't get much better than that."" Mancuso said he gets ""a little upset over"" criticism of Halford's decision to conduct the trial without FDA monitoring. He has posted a video response to the Kaiser Health News story on his Facebook page. ""He knew he had very little time to help people,"" Mancuso told CNBC. ""Nobody has $5 billion and 15 years to get a vaccine approved. ... He's a professor; he's on a professor's salary."" The Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, where Halford worked, when asked for comment by CNBC, referred to a statement the school issued earlier this week. ""Rational Vaccines licensed the patent rights from SIU School of Medicine to advance the clinical application of the vaccine and is required to abide by all applicable laws and regulations in pursuit of those development objectives,"" the school said in that statement. ""The 2016 clinical trial was conducted solely by Rational Vaccines. Dr. Halford's involvement was as the Chief Scientific Officer of Rational Vaccines, not as a faculty member of SIU School of Medicine. The company ran the clinical trial independently of SIU involvement."" ",Herpes vaccine firm backed by Peter Thiel promises FDA oversight,0.0181
53,"Leslie Kramer, special to CNBC.com",9072017,CNBC,8312017,"One third of Americans may be on their way to developing full-blown type 2 diabetes, and most of them don't even know it. A recent report from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that more than 84 million Americans, or roughly one-third of the population, have prediabetes, a condition marked by higher-than-normal blood sugar. Of that group, 90 percent aren't aware they have the condition. The primary risk factors for type 2 diabetes are genetics and lifestyle — excess weight, obesity and lack of exercise contribute to this alarming medical trend. ""People with prediabetes who don't change their lifestyle are at a much higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke and can develop type 2 diabetes within five years if left untreated,"" said William T. Cefalu, MD, chief scientific, medical & mission officer of the American Diabetes Association. The health risks go beyond heart disease and stroke. As diabetes worsens over time, blindness, kidney disease and lower-limb amputation are also major health risks. Diabetes was the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States in 2015, according to the CDC. This population of diabetes ""ticking time bombs"" is particularly alarming, because in many cases type 2 diabetes can be avoided, simply by leading a healthy lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes is often progressive, and within 10 years of diagnosis, 50 percent of individuals need to use insulin to control their blood glucose levels, according to the ADA. More than 30 million Americans — 9.4 percent of the U.S. population — are already battling diabetes, according to the CDC's National Diabetes Statistics Report, which used data through 2015. The CDC found that of those cases, 7.2 million were undiagnosed. ""The country needs to take this seriously, ratchet it up and make it a priority,"" said Ann Albright, PhD, RD, director of CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation. ""Far too few people know about it or know they have it, and that is why we launched the prevention program and joined forces with other organizations,"" she said. ""It requires us all to take this condition seriously."" Prediabetes is a condition in which a person's blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Doctors often refer to prediabetes as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), depending on which test they used to detect the condition. The A1C test is the most commonly used to detect the condition, because it is a blood test that provides information about a person's average blood glucose levels over the past 90 days. To be prediabetic, an individual would have to have an A1C result of 5.7 percent — 6.4 percent.  The results of a fasting glucose test that are 100-125mg/dl indicate IFG. If an oral glucose tolerance test is performed and the result is 140-199, it indicates IGT. All are considered prediabetes. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking tech: Human organs on a chip Venture capitalist wages war against Parkinson's ER costs are skyrocketing, leaving patients in shock The cost to the American health-care system and economy from diabetes is steep. The American Diabetes Association estimates at least $245 billion a year. Medicare, Medicaid and the military foot a large portion of that bill, paying for 62.4 percent of the cost of care, while 34.4 percent is paid for by private insurers and 3.2 percent by the uninsured, according to the ADA. The medical community has so far failed to contain prediabetes. A big part of the problem: People simply avoid going to the doctor. William Argenta was 48 when he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a couple of years ago. He had not been to a doctor in more than five years and only received the diagnosis when he finally decided to go in for a physical. He had experienced a feeling of being overly thirsty — often a sign of diabetes — but other than that, he didn't see any reason to get checked out. Once a patient is diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, they are advised to change their eating and exercise habits. Many are prescribed metformin — it is the most widely prescribed drug for diabetes under many brand names, including Glucophage — and helps control blood sugar levels. Metformin lowers blood glucose by reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver and by helping the body respond better to the insulin made in the pancreas. The FDA has approved metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes, but not for prediabetes, which is a serious health condition but does not reach the blood sugar level to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The FDA has been conservative about approving drugs for use beyond specific disease states. However, the FDA is now considering approval of metformin for use in prediabetes. While physicians can already administer it at their own discretion, the ADA says the drug is currently underused as part of treatment options. Ongoing follow-up to the federally funded Diabetes Prevention Program research study has shown that metformin has long-term cost-saving value in delaying type 2 diabetes, with great safety and low cost to the consumer, which may persuade the FDA to approve an indication for prediabetes. According to the ADA, metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes should be considered for people who have a high body mass index BMI, are aged 60 years or older, have rising A1C test results, despite lifestyle intervention, and for women with prior pregnancy-related glucose intolerance. There are several other drugs prescribed for prediabetes, including a weight loss drug,  but many have significant side effects. The ADA states that metformin has the best track record and safety profile. The ADA also notes that even metformin has been shown to be less effective than lifestyle modification — lifestyle changes can slow or prevent type 2 diabetes in some individuals with a genetic predisposition. Now a type 2 diabetic, Argenta has changed his lifestyle. He cut down on sugary food and has increased his protein intake. He is also exercising and taking metformin and a couple of other medications. Argenta says he now feels much better than he did before he was diagnosed. ""I guess I had just gotten used to feeling bad. Your body adjusts to it in some ways,"" he says. The CDC, ADA and the American Medical Association have launched a new prediabetes awareness campaign, DoIHavePrediabetes.org. The campaign encourages people to take an online test of seven simple questions that can assess a person's prediabetes risk. The organizations are also beseeching those at risk to change their eating and exercise habits before their condition worsens. Dr. Rhonda Todd, MD, internal medicine, is doing her part to raise prediabetes awareness. Based near Ann Arbor, Michigan, she tries to test as many of her patients as she can for prediabetes if they fit a risk profile, using the A1C test. Most private insurers cover the expense of an A1C test, as do Medicaid and Medicare when the patient present risk factors. Todd said she has never had a problem getting a test approved. The cost of the test is roughly $50 dollars, but Todd has seen some hospitals offer the test for $10, as a part of wellness programs. ""I will try to test every patient I see who is over 35, has a family history of the disease or who is obese or overweight, which is almost everybody,"" she says. Todd blames the sedentary lifestyle of Americans for the explosion of diabetes and prediabetes cases. ""We are not a healthy people anymore, technology is killing us,"" she said. Todd said the majority of doctors, many of whom are affiliated with hospitals, test for prediabetes often. She thinks the bigger problem is people not going to the doctor rather than doctor's not offering the tests. The ADA recommends testing for prediabetes in adults of any age who are overweight or obese and who have one or more additional risk factors. For all people, testing should begin at age 45 years and be carried out at a minimum of three-year intervals. Every 21 seconds another person in the United States is diagnosed with diabetes, according to the ADA. That's 4,110 people in America diagnosed with the disease every 24 hours. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all those cases. The risk for developing the disease also increases drastically in people age 45 and older, and after age 65 it increases exponentially. There has also been a troubling rise in the number of adolescents developing both prediabetes and diabetes. Weight has a lot to do with it. Among adolescents, ages 12 to 19, about 1 in 5 are considered to have obesity, and about 1 in 11 (9.1 percent) are considered to have extreme obesity, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""Nutrition for adolescents is the cornerstone of treatment,"" Cefalu said. ""People need access to adequate nutrition, and you have to get that information in their hands."" Testing for prediabetes in children and adolescents should be considered for those who are overweight or obese, and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes, including having a family history of type 2 diabetes, or who are African American, Native American, Latino, or Asian Pacific Islanders. More than half of Asian-Americans and nearly half of Hispanic Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. Health-care specialists say getting people to change their behavior isn't easy. ""Telling people to lose weight does not give them enough information. It is not a message that helps and supports them,"" Albright said. To teach people how to change and maintain a new set of lifestyle habits, the CDC is also promoting its National Diabetes Prevention Program, which was initiated in 2010. Just by participating and staying in the program, prediabetics can lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 58 percent over three years, and by 71 percent for people over age 60. ""We want to help them determine what is realistic and doable so they can make real life changes that are sustainable,"" Albright said. A DDP program can cost as much as $500 a year. (The CDC-recognized organizations delivering these programs determine the cost, which can vary depending on factors such as the size and experience of the organization offering it.)  Diabetes prevention programs are growing in number and participation, but are still underutilized, according to the ADA. The CDC is working with commercial health plans and employers, including state employers, asking them to consider offering the program as part of their health-care benefit packages or wellness programs. To date, 11 states are providing coverage for more than 3 million public employees, over 65 commercial payers are providing coverage in some markets, and four states are providing Medicaid coverage. The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services is in the final stage of approving this service for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The YMCA in many states also offers access to the program on a sliding-scale fee basis. Prevention does work. By losing just 5 percent to 7 percent of one's  body weight (10-15 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and practicing a basic exercise regime — such as taking a brisk walk, 30 minutes a day, five days a week — many people are able to return their blood glucose levels to the normal range, according to the CDC. But for lasting and widespread change to take place, more health-care professionals will need to get on board and proactively talk to people about the risk of diabetes and prediabetes, Cefalu said. ""We need to educate and train primary care providers, nurse educators and nutritionists, so they can better inform their patients about the condition and how to treat it."" While a physician referral is not required for an eligible participant to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle change program, the CDC has partnered with the American Medical Association on the Prevent Diabetes STAT (Screen, Test, Act Today). ""All sectors, including health care, business, nonprofit community organizations and faith-based organizations, need to be talking about prediabetes and encouraging those with prediabetes to enroll in a National DPP lifestyle-change program,"" Albright said.

54,Catherine Clifford,9072017,CNBC,8312017,"It's the anxiety, uncertainty and exhaustion that come through in Juan Escalante's first-person account of trying to live life as a ""dreamer"" under the Trump administration. ""WHAT IF: ... Trump deports my parents,"" tweets Escalante. ""What will happen to: our car leases, mortgages, student loans, relationships, degrees,"" he worries. So-called dreamers such as Escalante are undocumented immigrants who grew up in the U.S. and who were granted temporary protection from deportation and allowed to work through President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals administrative program. DACA was available to those under the age of 31 by June 15, 2012. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump dealt a blow to ""dreamers"" by ending DACA. Trump says he is upholding his ""highest duty"" — ""to defend the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that DACA was an executive overreach on the part of Obama and was thereby unlawful. Tuesday night President Trump tweeted that if Congress can't come up with a new immigration policy in six months, he will ""revisit"" the issue. For Escalante, 28, and others like him, each rule change, each day and month that there is another delay in coming up with a permanent solution, is a painful extension of an already emotional process. Escalante and his parents immigrated from Venezuela with a visa but, due to an error with the immigration paperwork, his entire family lost their legal status, his communications representative tells CNBC Make It. Because he was undocumented, he grew up without much hope of being able to make anything of himself. ""Imagine being 11 years old, and after living in the United States for over 10 years, you are consistently reminded that you would not be able to accomplish much due to your immigration status. That you wouldn't get a job, go to college or be accepted in the country that you grew up in due to your immigration status,"" Escalante says, in a Medium post. ""That is, of course, after graduating from high school, trying to navigate the country's broken immigration system, and paying taxes. ""Thanks to DACA, Dreamers have been able to build their lives, go to school and invest in the economy by buying a home or a car,"" says Escalante, who lives and works in Tallahassee, Fla. His two brothers also have DACA status. ""The thought that you would be STRIPPED off your DACA status is not just traumatizing, it's dehumanizing and exhausting,"" says Escalante via Twitter. Escalante is the digital campaigns manager for America's Voice, an immigration advocacy group. Read, below, what he calls a ""101 guide"" for what it feels like for DACA recipients in the current political climate. He emphasizes the ""psychological trauma"" of living under such uncertainty. What it feels like to be a Dreamer at this particular point in time.A 101 guide The sense that #DACA could come to an end is terrifying. Outside of just that, there several aspect to consider that drain Dreamers daily 1. The thought that you would be STRIPPED off your DACA status is not just traumatizing, it's dehumanizing and exhausting. 1a. DREAMers have been dealing with fear and anxiety since Trump came into office, and not just because the possible termination of DACA 1b. Many of us have witnessed Dreamers being arrested/deported, while simoultaneously FEARING for the safety of our undocumented parents 1c. Mental gymnastics occur while you're at work/home. You find youself asking:WHAT IF:DACA ends tomorrowTrump deports my parents 1d. And the issue lies that you don't want to open up to others who may not relate OR appear that youre complaining way too much 1e. This is where most of us find ourselves, at the corner of mental exhaustion, where fear/anxiety/doubt meet + but we refuse to give up 1f. So we keep going and going and going until we can't no more. Exhaustion, anxiety, or depression eventually get us. Burnout is real. 1g. Yet we can't stop. The fight for DACA and DREAM is a fight for OUR LIVES. 2. We keep wondering about our futures.What will happen to:- our car leases- mortgages- student loans- relationships- degreesEtc 2a. For the past 5 years Dreamers have relied on DACA to live with a sense of normalcy - build a life. 2b. Now all that time and investment into ""normalcy"" may be crushed. Which means:THINKING ABOUT BEING UNDOCUMENTED ONCE AGAIN 2c. Dreamers will tell you that we were all undocumented before, that we survived without DACA... but can we truly go back to that reality? 2d. If we were stressed and scared back then without DACA under Obama, can anyone imagine life w/o DACA under Trump? 2e. No amount of preparation to return to undocumented status can be done. Imagine having to prepare to face your worst nightmare (AGAIN) 2f. Are folks understanding the mental exhaustion? 3. What will happen to us if Trump tries to deport us?Weve seen Trumps unshackled Deportation Force attempt to deport DREAMers, who is nxt 3a. Families are being torn aparente left and right under Trump. Meanwhile, DACA beneficiaries have give the Gov significant private info 3b. Will this info be used to retaliate against us? Will frontline advocates like men be first? What can we expect/trust from trump? 3c. Being deported means going back to Venezuela - country under significant economic and political turmoil. What does it mean for others? These are just SOME of the numerous complexities and dimensions Dreamers navigate DAILY - while working/studying/etc The psychological trauma is real. Extremely really. Which is why inurge EVEYONE to circulate mental health resources from @UNITEDWEDREAM The fight is certainly NOT over after Trump announces the fate of #DACA. But we must consider what the road to THIS or means to all of us. If you need to reach out to friends, do it.If you need counseling, seek it.If you need meds, consider it. PLEASE take care of yourselves. And if youre an ally, please take care of Dreamers now more than ever...Everything helps. We need it. Good night.

55,Christina Farr,9072017,CNBC,8312017,"Drug companies need better ways to recruit patients for their clinical trials, an undertaking that costs millions of dollars today. Dozens of technology start-ups have popped up to solve this problem. One start-up in this group is Antidote.me, which today raised $11 million in a round led by Merck's strategic digital health fund. Existing investors Smedvig Capital and Octopus Ventures also participated in the round. Antidote is run by a group of European tech executives, including Pablo Graiver, a former vice president of Kayak, and Eze Vidra, a general partner for Google's venture arm in Europe. The company is now based in New York City to help it expand more deeply into the United States. It's a crowded market, but Antidote says it has a unique approach. ""Everyone is looking at a particular clinical trial and then trying to find the right patients,"" said Graiver, who had the idea of applying engagement models that work in other sectors, like e-commerce, to health care to bring a ""matching tool to patients, rather than expecting them to come to us."" Antidote serves people who are already searching for information about a health condition with potentially relevant clinical trials. It works with groups such as JDRF, a research organization for Type 1 diabetes, and Lung Cancer Alliance, to add an Antidote-branded tool to their websites (here's an example). Patients who are interested in participating in a clinical trial will be prompted to answer some questions, such as their location and how far they're willing to travel, their age, gender, and health condition(s). With each response, Antidote narrows down the list of trials they can apply for. This approach is appealing to pharma companies, as the responses provide them with more information than they could glean from a patients' medical record. For instance, they might learn whether a potential recruit is looking to get pregnant in the coming months, which might disqualify them from participating in the trial. Antidote says its tool has been used to match patients for 14,000 clinical trials to date. It gets paid through referral fees from pharmaceutical companies, as well as licensing fees for the health organizations it works with. Graiver said the company generated low-digit millions in revenues last year alone. ","Merck leads $11m round in Antidote.me, drug trial recruiting start-up",0.9181
56,"Leslie Kramer, special to CNBC.com",9072017,CNBC,8312017,"After four decades of progress preventing strokes that affect 800,000 Americans and kill up to 140,000 annually, progress has stalled, and in some states strokes are again increasing, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study, released Wednesday, shows that stroke death rates failed to continue to decline in 38 states during the 2013–2015 period, resulting in an estimated 32,593 excess stroke deaths that may not have occurred based on previous rates of decline. The data was compiled by the U.S. National Vital Statistics System from the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC. The increase came after successive declines in stroke deaths for every three-year period studied by the CDC between 2000 and 2013. Today strokes are the fifth-leading cause of death in the country, but 80 percent of strokes are preventable, according to the World Health Organization. A stroke occurs when blood flow to an area of brain is cut off and brain cells are deprived of oxygen and begin to die, resulting in the loss of abilities, such as memory and muscle function, controlled by that area of the brain. Strokes can often be prevented by two methods. Dr. Quanhe Yang, senior scientist, Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention at the CDC, said one is by adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as not smoking, eating a healthy diet that is low in salt and sugar and high in fruits and vegetables, being physically active and maintaining healthy weight. The second is by better managing the risk factors. ""If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes, you need to keep them under control by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and taking the proper medications,"" Yang said. Obesity is another cause for concern, because it is a major cause of hypertension, which is the single most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, according to the CDC report. Despite recent improvements, nearly half of the 75 million U.S. adults with hypertension do not have their blood pressure under control. More from Modern Medicine: America's No. 1 killer taking center stage in fight over drug prices One third of Americans on way to diabetes, and most don't know it Efforts to prevent heart disease run into a brick wall The current stall in progress preventing strokes is taking place in 3 out of 4 states across the United States and, surprisingly, not just in the 11 states in the Southeast known as the Stroke Belt, because those states have had higher stroke death rates historically than the U.S. average. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The CDC study could not conclude that any single factor or group of factors is directly responsible. However, poor diet, physical inactivity and lower-than-average social economic status — which often results in a lack of access to health insurance coverage and access to medical care — all contribute to the higher rates of strokes in these states and around the country, Yang said. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of a stroke and understanding the importance of calling 911 is critical to ensuring that stroke patients receive the best care as quickly as possible. Stroke symptoms tend to occur suddenly. Signs to look out for include weakness or numbness on one side of the body, confusion, trouble speaking or understanding, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, trouble walking, dizziness or loss of balance or severe headache. The American Stroke Association tells people to remember the acronym FAST, which can be used as a mnemonic to help detect and respond quickly to stroke victims. The acronym stands for ""Facial drooping,""Arm weakness,"" ""Speech difficulties"" and ""Time to call 911."" Yang said if you think someone is having a stroke, you should first ask the person if they are able to smile, to see if one side of the face is drooping. Next, ask the person to raise both arms up to check for arm weakness. Then ask the person to repeat a sentence to see if they can speak clearly, and then call 911 immediately. Time is of the essence because while a person is having a stroke, their brain cells are dying, so it's imperative that they get the care they need immediately. ""Get the person an ambulance and get them to the hospital so that they can get the proper treatment,"" Yang said. ""This will increase the chance of survival. Every minute counts,"" he added. Yang does not recommend driving yourself or someone having a stroke to the hospital. An ambulance can alert the hospital to the person's arrival and get the necessary equipment ready. A person having a stroke is typically experiencing a blood clot, so ""clot busting medication"" will be necessary, he said. ""It's a very time-sensitive procedure, and after three to five hours the effectiveness of procedure is greatly reduced."" Emergency medical services and hospitals also need to provide better care. To confront this issue, the CDC established the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program, named after the late Republican Senator from Georgia, who died in 2000, at age 61, from a massive stroke. ""This program was designed to help the states to improve the quality of care and treatment of stroke patients, from symptoms, to getting to the hospital, to in-care hospital care and out patient care,"" Yang said. The Coverdell program is working with hospitals in nine states to develop coordinated systems of care to reduce stroke-related death and disability. It is also working closely with partners in healthcare to enhance the quality of stroke care through data-driven quality improvement in approxi­mately 570 hospitals, which have treated more than 620,000 acute stroke patients in the United States since 2005. The Million Hearts initiative, co-led by the CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services — and supported by many public and private partners — is also working on initiatives that they believe could help to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2022. They include getting the word out about intervention methods and convincing people to reduce their sodium (salt) intake, cut out tobacco use, and start exercising. They are also telling people to improve implementation of the ""ABCS"" method of prevention, which include taking aspirin when appropriate, keeping one's blood pressure under control, managing one's cholesterol, and quitting smoking. Health-care providers should also be looking out for patients who may need to begin cardiac rehabilitation, and should be focused in particular on priority populations at high risk for heart disease and stroke. The data also showed a statistically significant increase among the subset of Hispanic-Americans, with a 5.8 percent annual increase, and among the population of the South Census Region, at an increase of 4.2 percent. In Florida alone, there was a 10.8 percent increase. ""This is a wake-up call,"" Yang said. ""We have to remember that 80 percent of strokes are preventable. Every one of us can do something to regain the momentum in the decline of the number of strokes."" Yang added that one-third of stroke cases take place in people who are 35 to 64 years-old. But the study also found that more young people are being hospitalized with the increased risk factors for stroke. ""In the U.S. we do have an epidemic of obesity and diabetes. One in three adults in the U.S. is obese, and that's a problem, because obesity can cause high blood pressure, which is the primary risk factor for a stroke,"" he said. Recent studies reported that in the past 15 years, younger adults have experienced a significant increase in both stroke hospitaliza­tions and in associated stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, and tobacco use. Changes in modifiable stroke risk fac­tors might present new challenges for stroke prevention and a sustained decline in stroke mortality in U.S., according to the CDC report. A report published in June by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that stroke hospitalization rates for younger adults significantly increased from 2003 to 2012; among men (41.5 percent) and women (30 percent) aged 35 to 44 years. It also found a near doubling of the prevalence of three or more of the common stroke risk factors among both men and women aged 18 to 64 years who were hospitalized due to strokes. Diabetes is another risk factor. Currently, there are 30 million people in the U.S. with diabetes, 85 million with prediabetes, and 75 million adults with high blood pressure, and only half of those are under control. ""If you put this all together, we have a very significant situation here, and a change in the risk profile in the population. That is why it is of great concern,"" he said. ""This short term trend may become a larger one. Healthy lifestyle plays a big role in the reduction of stroke risk and death.""

57,Yen Nee Lee,9072017,CNBC,8312017,"As the U.S. mulls its next move against North Korea, some have suggested that sanctioning the major Chinese banks could be the most effective way to pressure the rogue nation into halting its nuclear program. Targeting the big lenders from the world's second-largest economy is not a new idea. And it would not necessarily just be a way to lash out at Beijing for not controlling Pyongyang sufficiently: Some Chinese banks, like the Bank of China, are said to have helped North Korea evade sanctions. But the big Chinese banks have so far avoided any punishments by the U.S., which has instead blacklisted smaller players such as Bank of Dandong for financing North Korea. That could change after the hermit nation claimed over the weekend that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb — a much more powerful weapon compared to those it previously tested. In response, President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. is considering ""stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea"" and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is reportedly drafting a harsher sanctions package. Donald Trump tweet: The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. China is North Korea's largest trading partner, accounting for 85 percent of the latter's trade and has a ""fair amount of leverage"" over the hermit nation, Bejoy Das Gupta, Asia Pacific chief economist at the Institute of International Finance told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" In an August announcement by the Treasury Department, more Chinese entities were added to the U.S. sanctions list. Mnuchin at the time said the Treasury ""will continue to increase pressure on North Korea"" by, among others, ""isolating them from the American financial system."" All big four state-owned banks in China have in recent years increased their presence in the U.S., where their operations now include providing loans, issuing bonds and financing trade activities. The four major Chinese banks are also the largest lenders by assets in the world, according to the latest ranking by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is the world's largest bank with $3.47 trillion in total assets as of the end of 2016, S&P said. Another three Chinese banks round up the top four of the global ranking: China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China. Those three lenders have assets between $2.60 trillion and $3.02 trillion. In comparison, the largest American bank is JPMorgan Chase at sixth place on the S&P ranking, with assets of $2.49 trillion as of the end of 2016. The biggest European bank, HSBC, was seventh with $2.37 trillion worth of assets. The growing size of the Chinese lenders has also allowed Asia's largest economy to overtake the euro zone as the world's biggest banking system last year with total assets of $33 trillion, according to an analysis by the Financial Times. Rep. Pete King tweet: UN must impose oil embargo on N Korea ASAP. If China or Russia veto, US must sanction anyone doing business with NK, including Bank of China. The health of the Chinese financial system is closely-watched as banks hold more than 90 percent of total assets in the world's second-largest economy, according to Reuters. Sanctioning the largest players would thus have ""international economy and markets"" implications, Scott Seaman, director for Asia at geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""The U.S. Treasury Department has often been hesitant to expand the secondary sanction regime to include, for example, restrictions on Chinese SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and Chinese large banks in part because the Chinese government will react very negatively, but also it will have an impact on international economy and markets,"" Seaman said. ""But we do expect the U.S. to come up with additional restrictions on things that will probably make Beijing upset,"" he added.

58,Zameena Mejia,9072017,CNBC,8312017,"Face it, we can't all be Elon Musk and work nearly 90 hours a week. Nor are we all fortunate enough to make a living working under 40 hours a week. No matter where you fall, half of all Americans feel  overworked and burned out. Amber Discko, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer who worked on her social media team, is out to change that. Discko, 27, created the beginnings of self-care app Aloe while experiencing a difficult time working the final four months of Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""It was an incredible experience to work on it, but it was hard to balance my mental health with the stress of the campaign and dealing with the toxic news cycle,"" Discko tells CNBC Make It. She created a personal checklist, which assessed wellness items like if she was hydrated, had taken a break from the computer screen in the last hour and if she had been going to sleep on time. Despite working with a ""diverse, smart group of people,"" she noticed that others working on the campaign were also suffering from exhaustion. ""It's very common, especially with millennials, to overwork yourself when you're super passionate about a cause,"" Discko says. ""We are so driven to do our best that we let other things slide by."" Discko surpassed her  Kickstarter $40,000 goal, raising $50,528 for Aloe, primarily through Twitter followers, and continues receiving support through creative funding platform Patreon. The app is expected to be released for iOS devices first in January with Android to come later. With help from the Femsplain community, an online publication Discko ran the past three years, Aloe already exists in the form of her now-public, online self-care checklist, a printable checklist for your desk and as interactive Twitter bot ""@aloebud."" garden tweet Once completed, Aloe will have three main sections: a check-in area to mark your accomplishments, a reminders section to motivate you throughout the day and a mad-lib style reflections section that gives a glance at how you feel and what your next goal will be. There will also be also a community support feature to connect with others using the app. Discko says Aloe will provide a simpler path to wellness for even the hardest workers out there. She hopes teams in offices will put the app to use. ""Because people are chained to their desks, they are working long hours,"" Discko says. ""I'm hoping if workplaces can encourage their teams to take moments for themselves throughout the day, it will create a better environment to work in."" For those who are unsure if they feel worker burnout, Stanford psychologist and research scientist Emma Seppälä notes it's when you are lacking energy, feeling down and feel generally unmotivated to do work. ""It seems ridiculous to need an app to remind you to sleep, breathe, eat,"" Seppälä tells CNBC Make It, ""but we've gotten to the point where people do need reminders."" She says this is because people are caught up in an ""overwhelming"" amount of responsibilities. ""Plunged into our virtual worlds and crunched for time, we tune out completely from our own needs for sleep, exercise, even food,"" Seppala says. In researching her book, ""The Happiness Track,"" Seppälä found that half of American workers, regardless of profession or position in corporate hierarchies,  are burned out. ""We've gotten so addicted to working, we're so overwhelmed with notifications from our devices, and we're generally so overwhelmed trying to balance home life and work,"" Seppälä says, ""that it's no surprise we're seeing 50 percent burnout across industries right now."" work tweet Apps like Aloe can provide reminders and a  supportive community to help keep us on track, Seppälä says. ""We are profoundly social people for whom connection and a sense of belonging is crucial for health and happiness,"" Seppälä says. Since we are no longer always living in tight-knit communities with family and friends reminding us to take care of ourselves or pitching in to help cook a meal, Seppälä says ""online communities are sometimes a great way to make sure you have people to connect with, be motivated by and look out for."" Without self-care, notes Seppälä, comes more burnout. ""When complete burnout happens, then you can have health consequences,"" she notes, including stress-induced health problems like inflammation and diabetes. Discko says she has received online criticism and constant questions about the usefulness or necessity for the app, which will be free when launched and have in-app upgrades for personalization. A post shared by Aloe (@aloebud) on Mar 10, 2017 at 10:18am PST But Seppälä wants people to consider this: health care expenditures at high-pressure companies are nearly 50% greater than at other organizations. She cites an  American Psychological Association estimate which finds that the U.S. economy loses more than $500 billion due to workplace stress as well as 550 million workdays lost yearly to stress on the job. Seppälä says wellness apps like Aloe can promote a more inclusive workplace culture if the entire work culture buys into the idea that self-care is important, adding they should ""for the sake of the bottom line if anything."" ""You need an entire workforce, and especially its leaders, to support the idea,"" Seppälä says. Discko says Aloe can help bosses and managers lead the conversation on mental health at work. ""Being able to say you need to take a moment to manage your own health and talk with your colleagues who know you've been working hard is important,"" Discko says. ""If people in the workplace were kinder to one another, making sure they feel good about their work and their day,"" she adds, ""I think more people would be inclined to work harder and work together.""

59,"Andrew Zaleski, special to CNBC.com",9072017,CNBC,8312017,"About four years ago Jeff Burnstein attended his first China International Robotics Show, the annual Shanghai-based expo now in its seventh year. At the time, Burnstein, president of the Robotic Industries Association, a Michigan-based trade group, wasn't impressed. He said he walked around the show and thought many of the robots on display looked like copies of what American companies were already doing. In today's China a different picture is taking shape, courtesy of a blueprint known as the Made in China 2025 plan. Announced in 2015, the initiative is China's massive government-backed push to be a world leader in a number of high-tech industries, such as medical devices, aerospace equipment and robotics — the key piece of the country's desire to automate sectors of its economy: automotive manufacturing, food production, electronics and more. But to do that, China needs more robots. In addition to the Made in China 2025 plan, the government has also released the Robotics Industry Development Plan, a five-year plan to rapidly expand the country's industrial robotics sector. By 2020, China wants to be able to manufacture at least 100,000 industrial robots annually. The country is racing full steam ahead to a robot-powered future in a push to not only remake its own economy but also to transform into the world's robot capital — overtaking Japan, Germany and the United States in the process. ""The Chinese are the fastest-growing and largest user of robotics in the world by now,"" said Burnstein. ""The 2025 plan will only accelerate it."" According to the International Federation of Robots, China is already home to the biggest share of robots, a global market worth about $30 billion. It is currently ranked the No.1 sales market for industrial robots, with the United States coming in at No. 4. (South Korea and Japan are two and three, respectively.) While the United States is arguably the worldwide leader in automation in vehicle manufacturing, China is quickly making gains to outstrip the U.S. and other global competitors. Over the first half of this decade, China  installed 90,000 industrial robots, or one third of the world's total, compared to 80,000 industrial robots installed between 2010 and 2015 elsewhere in Asia, Europe and the United States combined. ""I'm sure there are lots of manufacturers in China who are focused on crushing the U.S.,"" said Matt Beane, a robotics researcher and fellow at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. ""But it seems like China's whole goal is to become self-sufficient."" A new  International Federation of Robots report shows that China will likely represent 40 percent of the total worldwide sales for robots by 2019, an increase from 27 percent in 2015. China's steady growth in spending on robotics has even caught the eye of entrepreneur and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. In an  open letter to President Donald Trump last December, he said the United States should invest $100 billion into the robotics industry in order to compete with China. ""We have to win the robotics race. We are not even close right now,"" Cuban wrote. More from CNBC Disruptor 50: Investors poured $2.8B into reaching outer space. They may not be done
AirPods don't go far enough: Reinventing headphones for 'hearables' era
Stadiums are getting smarter, giving ticket-holders money's worth But many of these robots are ones produced elsewhere that Chinese companies purchase. The country would now like to flip the script and produce in country more of the industrial robots it needs in a variety of economic sectors. By 2020 the government wants more than 50 percent of the total robotics sales volume to be filled by robots made in China by Chinese companies. Producing robots in-house, so to speak, is where China is looking to outpace America. Beane noted that China has ""never had this character of deliberately going toe-to-toe with another global power."" But what they do have is a desire to look toward the future by investing billions of dollars in robotics and complementary technologies, like artificial intelligence, in order to not rely on other nations to outfit their factories. ""China will throw tons of money toward [robotics] that we will not,"" Beane said. ""They're looking to play a long game where, through steady investment, they make it less and less likely that countries that act impulsively can catch up."" Robots and automation are priorities in China, where salaries have increased more than 100 percent over the last 10 years while the national labor force has been shrinking. With industrial robots, Chinese companies hope to keep innovating while cutting costs. Signs of this shift are already present. Foxconn, a leading supplier of Apple iPhones,  replaced 60,000 workers with robots in just one of its Chinese factories last year. ""The long-term goal in China is to transform it from a low-cost labor source to being a high-tech labor source,"" said Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report in California. ""That's a major technology transformation, and they're doing it."" As Tobe wrote in a  rundown of the Made in 2025 plan, China wants to ""overtake Germany, Japan, and the U.S. in terms of manufacturing sophistication by 2049."" The Made in China 2025 plan helps out by offering subsidies, low-interest loans and rent-free land to Chinese companies. Consider what Guangdong, just one Chinese province, is doing: offering almost $140 billion in subsidies to about 2,000 local companies, including robotics firms. ""To reduce the threshold of innovative entrepreneurship, the government provides appropriate financial subsidies for rent, broadband access and public software for new businesses,"" said John Rhee, general manager of the Los Angeles office for UBTECH, a Chinese robotics company headquartered in Shenzhen City that makes humanoid robots for the home. UBTECH is one such company currently benefiting from the Made in China 2025 plan. In April the company signed a ""strategic cooperation agreement,"" Rhee said, with the municipal government of Kunming City in the southwestern province of Yunnan, which will aid the company in robot building and developing artificial intelligence capabilities in Yunnan province for the purpose of making Kunming and other municipalities A.I.-enabled ""smart"" cities. But how quickly China can get itself up to speed in the globally competitive robotics field is still a question, as is the overall effectiveness of the Made in 2025 plan on growing China's robotics industry. ""China can manufacture simple robots but nothing complicated, like the six-axis ones by Japan, Germany and the U.S.,"" said Zi Yang, a China analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based Jamestown Foundation. ""It's hard to close the gap due to several reasons, mainly because of China's lack of innovativeness due to its weak intellectual property laws and government-led projects that focus on quantity over quality."" Indeed, that push for quantity is one of the aggressive goals China has set for itself in its Made in 2025 plan. By the end of next decade, the country wants to be producing 400,000 industrial robots annually. That's a tall order, considering just a little more than 250,000 industrial robots were  sold the world over in 2015 alone, according to the IFR. Some Chinese companies are actively buying the expertise in robotics that has been developed elsewhere. One such company, Midea,  closed a $4 billion deal earlier this year to acquire Germany-based Kuka AG, a leading, global robotics supplier for plant and automotive robots with a research and development center in Austin, Texas. While Yang admits this is a sign of a shift from quantity and toward quality, he also said that Chinese robotics companies ""can't buy their way into industry leadership. They must innovate, and that's the most difficult hurdle to overcome, since the constraints are structural."" There are signs that that's beginning to happen. This past July, RIA president Burnstein went back to CIROS in Shanghai. He said he left with a different impression after seeing many new companies and many of the same companies he saw just a few years ago. ""It's a lot more sophisticated. You wouldn't say it's all copies anymore,"" he said. ""Basically, China wants to compete everywhere, and they want to be a major, global robot supplier. And they're actively doing it."" These start-ups are on the cutting edge of big consumer, technology and business shifts — and already worth billions. Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson says it's not enough for tech companies to accept that hate speech is a complicated issue. A successful online retail start-up like Rent the Runway can't beat Amazon on overall selection or price, but it can defend against the risk from Jeff Bezos' giant by focusing on quality, curation and community. It's working. Kevin O'Leary says the Trump administration has finally ""unshackled the small businesses in America"" by eliminating past administrations' regulation-heavy policies.

60,"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC.com",9072017,CNBC,8312017,"Amidst the media hubbub of the new presidential administration, autism was back in the news. Well-known vaccine skeptic Andrew Wakefield attended one of President Donald Trump's inaugural balls; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and outspoken critic of vaccines, claimed that Trump had asked him to chair a commission on ""vaccine safety and scientific integrity,"" though seven months after those initial reports no concrete plans for such a commission have been made public. Both Wakefield and Kennedy have expressed their doubts about the safety of vaccines on the basis that they may be linked to increased incidence of autism. For many researchers working to find the causes of autism, this is frustrating, if well-tread, rhetoric. ""Regarding vaccines, the case has been closed for many years as far as the evidence is concerned,"" says Mayada Elsabbagh, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University. Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, called the discussion about vaccines and autism a ""distraction"" because money spent looking into it isn't being dedicated to more pressing research questions. In the past decade, researchers have come a long way in narrowing down which conditions may make autism more likely to develop. What they learn could lead to more sophisticated treatments for autism at its early stages, or even prevent the disorder from developing in the first place. Autism Spectrum Disorder, or autism for short, is a disorder that can affect how the brain develops. It's characterized by social challenges, difficulties in communication and behavioral issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms usually appear in children between 12 and 18 months old. And the effects of autism can range from slight social challenges to severe cognitive impairment. ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism — everyone looks a little different,"" says Heather Volk, an assistant professor in the department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. About 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the CDC. Today the Autism Society estimates that 3.5 million Americans are living with an autism spectrum disorder, and the prevalence has been rising over time, increasing by 119.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to the CDC. Though that's likely also driven by greater awareness of the condition and its symptoms, as well as access to services, Elsabbagh says. A 2014 study found that it costs $2.4 million to support a person with autism and an intellectual disability (which appears to affect 40 percent to 60 percent of those with autism) throughout the course of his or her life. Scientists spent decades looking for a specific gene, or a specific part of the brain, that could be causing the symptoms of autism. But that work hasn't turned up any one specific answer. Instead, researchers have had to change their questions. They now suspect that autism, like other complex diseases such as cancer or obesity, comes about by the interaction of many different genes and environmental factors. Researchers estimate that there may be hundreds of genes that could make someone more likely to develop autism, but merely having any one of those genes doesn't determine whether or not the disorder develops, or how severe it is if it does. Through careful epidemiological studies conducted on large populations, a number of scientists, including  Craig Newschaffer at Drexel University and Peter Bearman at Columbia University, have been able to point to some factors that correlate to the risk of autism. Over the years, researchers have determined that childhood or prenatal exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides ; hormone-disrupting phthalates (often found in plastics) and some found in air pollution, have played a role. Mothers who have bacterial or viral infections during pregnancy or those who are obese are also more likely to give birth to babies who are later diagnosed with autism. It's important to note, however, that these are risk factors for autism, not causes — there's a correlation between these factors and autism, but researchers aren't quite sure of the mechanism that might make the disorder more likely to develop. Researchers are getting creative with the kinds of studies they are designing to better assess these and other potential risk factors. One long-running study at the University of California, Davis tracks a huge array of children's genetic and environmental factors in children as young as two years old to compare those that develop autism to those that do not. Other research efforts start even earlier, tracking moms — since autism seems to run in families, scientists are recruiting mothers who already have one child with autism, then recruit the next sibling. ""If you do this during pregnancy, you can give the mom questionnaires in real time and ask her things like where she drove, what she ate,"" Volk says. Plus, you can take samples from the mother during her pregnancy or even image the fetus' brain as it develops. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking science: Human organs-on-a-chip

A new sickle-cell drug 25 years in the making But even if a well-designed study uncovers a new risk factor, that has to be validated and replicated by other scientists. And so far, Volk says, researchers are not far enough down the road to come up with any interventions to treat or prevent autism based on those findings. There are some findings that, if reflected in policy, are generally beneficial, such as having cleaner air and making baby bottles that are BPA-free. ""But we're not far enough to think about pharmacological interventions in pregnancy,"" Volk says. Right now the most effective interventions for autism take place after a child has begun to show symptoms. ""The best way for us to support children with autism is to support parents so that they interact with children and address concerns with children together,"" Elsabbagh says. Programs are popping up all over the world to help parents do exactly that—to modify their own behavior towards children with autism so that, over time, the children's brains develop in the most optimal way possible. In the US, some of those programs include the UC Davis MIND Institute, the  Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in New York and the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. Researchers are working on how to make these costly programs available to all families who need them, Elsabbagh says. It's not clear what future interventions might look like. But scientists are working on it. ""I think the best thing we can do as scientists is ask smart questions and follow the data where it seems to point,"" Volk says. Sometimes, that process is time consuming or surprisingly complex. ""I think maybe the challenge in that type of reporting is that science changes incrementally. We make small discoveries over time,"" Elsabbagh says. And though they've been at it for decades, researchers are hopeful that they can unravel autism to provide more effective interventions for people with autism. ""I don't think [understanding autism] is an unsolvable problem. I don't think any autism researcher would be doing it if it were,"" says Halladay of the Autism Science Foundation. According to the National Autism Association,  a person with autism may: Not respond to his or her name.Have obsessive interests.Avoid eye contact or physical contact.Have difficulty understanding, or showing understanding, of others' feelings or their own.Repeat words or phrases.React more or less sensitively than usual to sounds, smells, tastes, sights or physical sensations.

According to ArcView, a leading cannabis research firm, the compound annual growth rate for legal North American weed sales is estimated to be 26% between 2016 and 2021. In terms of numerical value, we're talking about almost $15 billion in legal sales growth as a result of ongoing legalization efforts in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., as well as organic growth opportunities in already legal nations and states. We've also witnessed a very discernible shift toward favorability among the American public. CBS News' latest poll from April 2017 found that an all-time record number of respondents (61%) wants to see pot legal across the country. A separate study from Quinnipiac University, also this past April, found almost universal support (94%) for medical cannabis when asking if it should be legal in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Opinions are shifting toward cannabis, sales are growing rapidly, and marijuana stock investors are profiting. Of the one dozen largest marijuana stocks by market cap, the average of these weed stocks has more than doubled in value over the trailing-12-month period. But do these rising valuations make sense? That will depend on whether these publicly traded pot stocks have the sales growth to back up their budding valuations. Today, we're going to take a look at three pure-play marijuana stocks with the highest annual sales, based on their most recent full-year earnings report. You'll note the use of ""pure play,"" meaning we're excluding publicly traded marijuana companies that only derive a portion of their revenue from legal pot. This means Scotts Miracle-Gro, which generates near 10% of its annual sales from its focus on hydroponics (growth in a nutrient-rich water solution), soil, and lighting solutions, for the medical cannabis industry won't make the cut. Neither will Insys Therapeutics, which only recently launched its oral dronabinol solution Syndros as a treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as anorexia associated with AIDS. Insys relies predominantly on sales of breakthrough cancer therapy Subsys for the time being. Instead, the following three pot stocks, which all share something in common, are your true ""green giants."" Image source: Getty Images. In terms of annual sales, no marijuana stock generates more than Canadian medical cannabis grower and retailer MedReleaf (NASDAQOTH:MEDFF), which only went public about three months ago. As you'll note below, all three of the top-selling pot stocks are Canadian producers and retailers for the country's medical weed industry. MedReleaf is in fine financial shape for a number of reasons. Rather than having to effect numerous bought-deal financings that could balloon its outstanding share count, its recent initial public offering raised bountiful capital that it can use to expand its Bradford facility in Ontario. This will lead to new capacity that can help MedReleaf meet rising demand from the medical side of the equation, as well as the growing possibility that Canada may legalize recreational marijuana by July 1, 2018. In particular, MedReleaf has two advantages that have allowed it to thus far stand out from a crowded field. First, it tends to focus on higher-quality strains of cannabis, which also cost more. MedReleaf has discovered that medical pot patients will pay more for a higher-quality product, which is one reason why the company's sales more than doubled from fiscal 2016. Second, MedReleaf has a keen focus on cannabis oils. According to a company investor presentation, it controlled 44.5% of the Canadian cannabis oils market as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Cannabis oils traditionally have a higher price point and margins than dried cannabis, which has set MedReleaf up for success. Image source: Getty Images. By a seemingly razor-thin margin, Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE:CGC) has the second-highest annual sales total at $32 million.  However, it saw considerably quicker growth than MedReleaf in its most recent fiscal year as a result of its aggressive acquisition strategy. According to its full-year report, the company's sales grew by 214% from the previous year. Canopy Growth is attempting to become the kingpin of the Canadian market by gobbling up other companies and land. Earlier this year, it completed its acquisition of Mettrum Health, which wound up giving Canopy Growth access to about half of Canada's registered medical patients. That's a sizable patient pool considering that Health Canada in May noted a 10% monthly growth rate in registered medical weed patients. It also acquired 472,000 square feet of land surrounding its headquarters, which could serve to expand its grow capacity if Canada were to legalize recreational weed. Another interesting tidbit about Canopy Growth that's helped its sales soar is the fact that it's one of just a handful of producers that's been cleared to export its cannabis to countries where medical marijuana is legal. A good example is Germany. Medical cannabis recently became legal in Germany, but domestic production is minimal, which is where Canopy Growth's exports come into play. Finally, Canopy Growth relies on branding partnerships to attract new customers. Its Tweed branding is among the most recognized in Canada, and partnerships with well-known rap artist Snoop Dogg have only aided its efforts to improve brand awareness. Image source: Getty Images. In a distant third, but growing very rapidly, is Canada's Aphria (NASDAQOTH:APHQF), which produced $16.4 million in full-year sales for fiscal 2017. Every headline figure moved in the right direction for Aphria in its latest full-year report, including 142% sales growth, 962% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth from the previous year, a 44% decline in cash costs to produce dried cannabis, and a 670-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin. Like MedReleaf, Aphria is trying to grow its operations primarily through organic expansion. It's in the process of working on a multiphase expansion that'll boost its growing capacity to 1 million square feet. In fact, it recently upped its projected annual output to 100,000 kilograms once its $100 million phase 4 project is complete. As with the other producers above, this project couldn't come at a better time considering the rapid growth in registered medical patients and the possibility of legal recreational pot coming to Canada by next summer. Aphria is also among that aforementioned group of companies that have been given the OK to export cannabis to foreign countries. Between demand from Europe, Canada's medical pot industry, and the possibility of a recreational legalization, Aphria and its peers may struggle to meet demand, which would have been an almost laughable scenario just a few years before.

    These 3 Pure-Play Marijuana Stocks Are Generating the Highest Annual Sales -- The Motley Fool

62,Todd Campbell,9072017,Fool,8312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Following Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) decision to buy Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) for $11.9 billion in cash, we couldn't help but wonder what other healthcare stocks could be takeover targets, too. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: Buyouts, buyouts, buyouts! Harjes: Yeah, I can see why. Last week, you were talking to my colleague Michael Douglass on this show about Gilead Science's acquisition of Kite Pharmaceuticals. So, this week, we figured we would continue the trend a little bit by highlighting some stock we think might be the next takeover candidates. After that, we'll discuss the demise of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), a stock that shed half its value just last month. But first, Todd, I feel like the biotech space is particularly talked about in terms of buyout speculation. Why do you think that is? Campbell: People like to hit home runs in this industry. [laughs] You know? By the nature of the beast, with clinical trials failing and successes being rare, and failures being more frequent, when people go in and buy biotech stocks, they tend to be more risk tolerant. Wouldn't you agree, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, sure. And, investors should be pretty risk tolerant if they're going to enter particularly clinical-stage biotech space. I don't know, it confuses me why there's so much speculation and hope for buyouts, because if it were me and I was buying one of these companies that had what I thought could be a blockbuster drug, I wouldn't want it to get bought out. I would want all that upside of them potentially bringing it to market and actually succeeding. But maybe that's a long-term, short-term difference. Campbell: Yeah, but Kristine, it's not like consumer goods, where you're dealing with a brand like Coca-Cola. All of biotech is driven by patent expiration or protection. With innovation moving so quickly, you may have a great, innovative product, but how long will that innovation keep you ahead of the competition that's coming up the pipeline behind you? From a corporate standpoint, [I think there are] some reasons why you've got entrepreneurs who are saying, ""Let's ring the register and be willing to sell,"" and from the acquirer standpoint, you've got people saying, ""OK, we've got patents expire in, what's the next big thing and can we bring it into our fold to offset that risk?"" Harjes: Yeah, you're right, I can totally see why both sides of the equation would be interested in it. I guess my hesitation is, why do investors push for it so much? I think it's more just the fun of speculating, and that's exactly what we're about to do, is speculate a little bit on who we think could be the next big buyout. One place where there's been a ton of hype around potential acquisitions is none other than the CAR-T space. As a refresher, Kite Pharma, as I mentioned earlier, was bought by Gilead Sciences, it's a CAR-T cancer drug developer. On Kite's acquisition, a bunch of the other CAR-T developers also had their share prices pop, which to me is very indicative that people think that some of these other smaller players might also get acquired. Campbell: Yeah, that move up in Juno was pretty insane, wasn't it, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, I was pretty happy to see it. A long time ago, I realize I probably should have had my money in Kite instead of Juno, but I'm still sitting on my Juno shares. I was definitely a happy camper that day. Campbell: Yeah, I think we got, what, a 40% move up in the span of a couple of days? Obviously, investors were extrapolating, ""If Novartis gets their CAR-T approved, and Kite theoretically gets its approved in November, and Gilead just spent all this money acquiring Kite to be able to get that upside, and then Juno, Juno has these CAR-T drugs, too, and maybe those drugs will be even better. So, perhaps I should get involved with that!"" Harjes: Yeah. I think there are a couple of different ways people might be looking at this. The first is, Gilead might not be finished buying CAR-T developers. I think there are some people out there who look at Gilead's strategy here and say, ""They're not done, they don't want just Kite. They want to build an entire oncology franchise built around cellular therapy,"" which is exactly what you heard John Milligan say on the conference call regarding the Kite acquisition, that they're looking to do this, to see other companies they could fold in and augment what they've already built by buying Kite. So, this is that string of pearls acquisition technique where, instead of making one enormous splashy purchase, you can tuck in a couple of companies here and there, and they definitely have the money to do that. And, on the other side of that coin, you could also have speculation that someone else is going to buy Juno. I'm not sure who exactly that would be, but it could be Celgene. Campbell: I'll throw a name in the mix there, Kristine. Harjes: Who are you going to throw? Campbell: I'll say Celgene. Harjes: Yep. [laughs] Campbell: Why not? Harjes: They've already been looking at Juno in terms of partnerships. Campbell: Oh, absolutely! Correct me if I'm wrong, but they took a stake in it previously when it inked its deal on CAR-T development. I think Celgene has shown that it loves to tie itself to the wagon of emerging biotechnology. They don't have an internal CAR-T option. They do have some collaborations, one with bluebird bio, which was another stock that rallied significantly following the news on Kite. We've discussed that one on the show previously. So, they've got a couple deals externally for CAR-T, but they don't have anything internally. And since they've already shown that they want to be a major player in cancer, you could see that as being a possibility. But, I always get so nervous when we start talking about ifs and buts and whens and what ifs. Harjes: Yeah, you sound like you're about to throw out some caveats. Campbell: Well, yeah. If you look at what's been happening with CAR-T, Juno, I'm not going to call it and also-ran, but they went from being a front-runner to now being in, we'll call it third place. Their JCAR015, they had to shutter development of that. That was their lead product candidate, and they had to shutter development when safety risks caught up to them. Specifically, people were dying because of brain swelling. They had some patient deaths because of brain swelling. Well, they've now shifted their focus to JCAR017, which is a very intriguing drug. It's next generation CAR-T, and they think it could be safer. But, it's not like they've necessarily proven that out. They're not at the same stage as, say, Kite was, with a pending FDA application, or that Novartis was with their CAR-T in getting unanimous support from an adcom committee. So, I think there's a significant amount of risk with all the remaining CAR-T players, and that does make me a little bit cautious on the idea of them being a buyout. Harjes: Yeah. And they're, appropriately, a lot smaller than Kite. At their inflated market cap, Juno and bluebird are both around less than half the size currently. And that, of course, reflects the fact that they are earlier stage. Even bluebird is super early, but they also have this entire side gene therapy program. One more name that I want to mention, because Todd, you brought up the safety risks involved here with CAR-T, and this company that I think has a really a novel way of addressing the safety risks is so, so tiny. They're only $350 million in market cap, which, for Gilead to purchase them, that would be pennies to them. This company is called Bellacom. They have an interesting molecular switching technology that could potentially make it best-in-class down the road, but way down the road. It'll be years. Their lead candidate could maybe hit the market in 2019. So, super interesting technology that could potentially improve the outcomes of some of these CAR-T therapies, things like stem cell transplants, which often have complications. But, this, again, is an extremely early stage company. I'm not even sure if Gilead would be interested in them, because it's so tiny that it probably won't even be a needle mover. Campbell: Yeah. A company like Gilead, they like to focus on companies that are a little bit further along in their development, a little bit closer to market, where they can see a return on their investment in a relatively short period of time. They tied their wagon to Kite right now. I think, unless one of these other companies comes out there and shows that they really have dropped-dead better efficacy, better safety. Safety is going to be key in CAR-T, Kristine. I think that's the differentiator. Harjes: Well, that's a bunch of the Juno theory right now, that they're not going to be first but they might be safest. Campbell: Exactly! And if they are the safest, that's critical, because right now CAR-Ts are getting approved for use in refractory disease, heavily pretreated patients, these patients don't have a lot of treatment options. If they want to be able to tap into the much larger pool of cancer patients and move that up into earlier forms of treatment, they need to be able to prove that these drugs are safe. Now, in clinical trials, I think Juno has shown some really interesting interim results that suggest, possibly, it may have a better safety profile than, say, Kite's Axi-Cel. But, you need to roll this out in more patients, you need to evaluate this because we interim stuff that we saw in JCAR015 looked good, too, right? Harjes: Yeah. You definitely need a bigger sample size. Campbell: Oh, yeah, absolutely! Whenever it comes to investing in clinical-stage companies, I really do caution investors chasing the news and trying to buy something simply because it's running up because of something that's happened to another company. It's a risky way of investing. I think you're better off saying, do I like the technology, after doing the research? Reading everything there is on The Fool about Juno, am I convinced that this company has a better mouse track? If you think that's the case, then be a little patient, wait for shares to balance out a little bit. They've had a big run up. And then pick your spots. Again, keep it to a small, diversified position in your portfolio. Harjes: Yep. Let's pivot pretty hard here away from CAR-T and go over to the robotic surgery market, where Todd, you brought up to me another company that you think might be a very good buyout candidate. Campbell: Kristine, we spent a lot of time talking on the show about companies in biopharma. We don't really talk as much about companies in med-tech. And I thought it might be interesting to go out and try to find a company in med-tech that fits three criteria. I wanted to find something that's a little bit off the beaten path, something that's disrupting an industry. I also wanted to find something that already has a product on the market that's delivering sales growth, and I wanted to find a company that was already being shown some interest or some love by a larger company that could potentially become and acquirer. And when I put all that stuff up in the mixing bowl, the name that popped out for me was Mazor Robotics, a robotics company that's reenvisioning the way surgeons do spinal surgery. Harjes: At first, when I looked at this company, I was like, ""Oh, well, Intuitive Surgical, they're just going to dominate this space, why would I ever be interested in a smaller player?"" But, it turns out that there's actually two pretty separate markets. Mazor has the Mazor X and the Renaissance System that helps surgeons perform spine and brain procedures, which is pretty different from what Intuitive Surgical -- which, if listeners aren't familiar with them, they are the Goliath in robotic surgery. But, Intuitive focuses on gynecological, urology, and general surgery. Campbell: Right, more laparoscopic stuff. Harjes: Right. So, what Mazor is improving the accuracy of surgeons when they're doing these surgeries, it reduces complications, it minimizes the need for inner operative X-rays, which is great because that will lower the radiation doses that patients are exposed to, and it leads to a faster recovery and less postoperative pain. All good stuff there. Campbell: Which is very important. You have to remember that these procedures are being reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid at fixed rates. So, the more that hospital can reduce, say, recovery times, get patients in, get patients out, avoid complications that may end up having them return to the hospital where they're not likely to get reimbursed as much from Medicare and Medicaid, the better. I equate this company, Mazor, to where Intuitive Surgical was maybe five years ago, in the stage of, OK, we're at the tipping point where we've invested a lot of time, effort, and energy over the course of the last few years, and trying to establish ourselves with those first-mover surgeons, the ones who are saying, ""yes, I want to be on the cutting edge of technology."" And now we're getting to a point where there's enough clinical data and papers published and things going on that it's becoming a little bit more mainstream. You're reaching that tipping point where more hospitals may go out and start buying these machines, which are relatively expensive machines. They can run $800,000 to $1,000,000. So, it's a big investment for these hospitals and surgery centers. I think that's what we're seeing now. We're seeing Mazor generate pretty rapid growth for its latest system, which is the Mazor X. Harjes: Which is a win-win, because the more hospitals and surgery centers that you can get into, you not only have the sales from the systems themselves, you also get roughly $1,500 per procedure in disposables sales. That's that razors and blades model that we talked about with Intuitive Surgical. Plus, you also get the service contracts. So, at this point, Mazor just wants to sell the most of these machines that they can to continue getting in that constant revenue from the procedure sales and from the service contracts. So, what they've done is, they've enlisted a little bit of help. Campbell: Yes. And this brings us to the big company that's showing it some love part of the segment, where we step back and say, what's the spine market look like? And, if this company is disrupting the spine market, what players in spine right now are paying attention? And the company that is really paying attention is Medtronic. Medtronic cut a deal with Mazor last year to start using its sales force to generate out leads that would get surgeons at the hospitals that it calls upon to go check out Mazor's system. Harjes: Yeah. This is a partnership that had initially the responsibility for the two of these two companies to both be marketing these machines through the end of this year. Then, it had some options that came at the end of the year. But, we actually just found out earlier this week, I believe it was, that Phase II of the agreement is already going to kick in, which means that Medtronic will take over the exclusive rights to distribute the Mazor X system, and it'll also make another investment in the company. Campbell: Right. It was kind of like a courtship. You went out on a date to see if the two of you liked each other. You had Medtronic giving some very preliminary training on Mazor's system, learning a little bit about it, and then of course, starting to talk about it with the people they were calling upon and get those people to go. The way that the deal had structure originally was, if the Phase I portion of the deal had gone well, then you would advance to Phase II, where Medtronic takes over 100% of all the marketing of it. But that wasn't expected to happen until February of 2018. Instead, they're doing it now. So, that tends to show you a little bit of the opportunity that Medtronic thinks there is for the Mazor X, and how it thinks it may dovetail into its own spine platform, which includes things like, say, the implants that are being used by this system during these surgical procedures, and some of the other componentry that's used by this system during these procedures. You have Medtronic doing $649 million in quarterly sales tied to spine alone. And you have Mazor possibly on the cusp of contributing much more meaningfully to that number over time, now that Medtronic is taking over the responsibility of marketing them. Which, by the way, is global marketing, which is huge, because up toward now, Mazor has really only penetrated the U.S. market. It's not very well penetrated outside the U.S. Harjes: Yeah. I haven't even seen ex-U.S. numbers as projections from Mazor, but within the U.S. alone, the opportunity is still huge. Last year, they only used the system in 5,000 different procedures in the U.S., but they estimate that the total addressable market in just the U.S. is 500,000. So, stretch that out to the global opportunity, and yeah, absolutely, this opportunity is enormous. Campbell: Yeah, I don't know if this is going to get to the size of an Intuitive Surgical. I think there's a likelihood that at some point, Medtronic maybe just swoops in and buys up the company lock stock and barrel. It's already, Kristine, as part of these deals, putting its money where its mouth is and buying shares in Mazor. Harjes: Yep. The equity stake is also huge, just as a vote of confidence from Medtronic, which is a Goliath in the space. Campbell: Right. There are three tranches that Medtronic took advantage of. They bought some shares at $11.42, which has worked out really well for them. They bought another 4% at $21.84. Now, they have a third tranche that they're buying at $38.46. Once they're all said and done, they're going to already own about 12% of Mazor, with a potential to take that up to between 14 and 15% because of some warrants. Harjes: We'll be watching to see if that ever hits 100%. Onto the second segment of today's show where we answer the question, what the heck happened with Teva last month? Campbell: I feel like we've seen this movie before, Kristine. Harjes: With Teva? Campbell: Yeah. A company goes out, spends a lot of money on acquisitions, gets heavily indebted, sales start to fall, next thing you know ... Harjes: Yeah, here we are. Teva has a lot going on right now, but we will unpack all of that. As a reminder, back in August 2016, Teva bough Actavis, which is Allergan's generic business. This was largely funded by debt. Now, fast forward a little bit to today, and that's gotten them in some trouble. Campbell: Yeah, a little bit. The timing of it ... it looked like a really good deal at the time. It was a $40 billion deal, with some of it being done in Teva stock, and the rest of it being done in ""cash."" They borrow the money because, ""Why not, the interest rates are low, I can go out and buy this money and finance it with the sales growth and the cash flow."" That thinking is wonderful as long as you don't stumble and cash flow doesn't start to decline. Harjes: Yeah. When Teva reported earnings on August 23rd, its stock dropped 24% right away, which was due to a confluence of negative news in the earnings report. The most relevant one to this generics business was them saying that because of customer consolidation and increased competition from other generic drug makers, they're just not getting the prices that they're used to. Apparently, the negotiations that they went through on their contract renewals led to a 6% overall price decrease. They expect that to continue eroding through the rest of the year. So, that's alarming on its own, but I'm also really worried by the fact that management didn't really seem to see this coming. Campbell: No. I don't think a lot of the industry did, to be fair. I think some of the pharmacies themselves have been surprised by the impact of falling generic pricing. I think you've seen it throughout the entire supply chain. The reality is this is the situation we're in today on September 6th. We have a company that's a mammoth, it's a Goliath in generic drugs, that now has this rope around its neck in the form of this big debt payment that it has to make. That's going to force it to make some pretty drastic decisions. They've decided to cut their dividend substantially. Harjes: 75%, yeah. Campbell: Yeah, which is something that income investors never want to hear. You can almost hear the shares being flushed out of income portfolios on that news. And they have all sorts of other problems right now with the share price, because Allergan, as part of that deal, got a whole bunch of shares in Teva. They don't want those shares, so they're planning on unloading them in the open market, selling them. So, you have that weight on the share price as well. So, you have a pitch situation where you have generic drug price compression hurting margins and crimping cash flow, interest expense rising because of all of this debt, and a lot of shares becoming available for sale that's affecting the supply and demand for the pricing of the individual shares. Throw on top of all that, Kristine -- Harjes: Yeah, we're not done yet. If you had asked me a year ago, ""What is Teva's largest problem?"", I would have said the fact that Copaxone, which is a huge part of their branded business -- we talked about Teva as a generics business, but it actually does have a branded segment as well that is dominated by this one multiple sclerosis drug, it's the most popular MS drug in the world, and it's going to come off-patent as early as next year. It could be facing unbranded competition, dragging down its profits from this drug. So, we've had our eye on that forever. And all of the sudden, that problem is just one of many. Campbell: Right, they went from 20mg to 40mg so they could improve the dosing schedule, that protected market share for a couple of years. Now, there's been ongoing patent disputes between them and some generics that have some people thinking that you could end up with a 40mg competitor in relatively short order. This is a billion dollar a quarter drug. At one point, it was racking up $4 billion in sales. And in the second quarter, sales were down I think 12% in the United States to $843 million. This is a significant potential headwind at a time where the company doesn't need any more significant potential headwinds. Harjes: Yeah. I'll also know that they are still looking for a permanent CEO. The guy that they have right now is not anything other than an interim president and CEO after the old CEO stepped down last February. Todd, to wrap up this segment, when you're looking at this company, it has gotten really cheap if you look at it on an earnings multiple basis. Do you think it could be a value player right now? Campbell: A value player or a falling knife, take your pick. I don't know. Whenever you look at these metrics, they're either trailing 12 month metrics, which really don't reflect the situation that Teva's moving into, or they're based on forward estimates, which could very well not pan out depending on how this business ends up performing over the next few quarters. It's very hard to say it's cheap at 3X earnings per share if those are earnings per share could end up getting revised 50% lower. So we just simply don't know. You're right, it's trading at a price to book value that's less than one. It's trading at a low single-digit P/E ratio. But, the current ratio is also less than one, which means it doesn't have a whole heck of a lot of wiggle room in the short-term when it comes to financing its short-term or paying its short-term obligations. Do I think that Teva Pharmaceuticals is going to disappear? I guess, push come to shove, no. Am I willing to bet more than 1% of my portfolio on it? [laughs] I think that's the way you have to look at it. You have to say, ""Maybe this is cheap, and I think it's going to come out on the other side. And certainly, there are big demographic trends at support generic prescription volume over time. Maybe I'll put 1% of my portfolio in it, and if it ends up tripling or quadrupling from these levels over a course of five or 10 years, yay, I'm rewarded."" Harjes: Yeah. You also have that dividend yield that, at this point, is looking kind of insane. I want to say it somewhere around 7%. But, I agree with the hesitation in your voice that says this one is likely to be a falling knife. Campbell: Yeah. Kristine, that dividend yield, though, is based on the trailing, not the forward, I don't think. And now that they've cut the dividend, I don't think it's yielding nearly as much. I don't think it's nearly as attractive on that. Over time, you could get into a situation where cash flow stabilizes, they have a plan to restructure by selling some units, raising some cash. If they can do those kind of things, and cash flow grows again, maybe the dividend starts increasing, and that will be one of the key drivers that makes the stock go much higher. But, it's a very high risk-reward stock in my opinion. Harjes: Absolutely. That'll do it for today's show.

Few industries, if any, are growing as quickly as legal marijuana. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, the North American legal-weed industry generated $6.9 billion in sales in 2016, which still pales in comparison with the $46.4 billion in sales estimated on the black market. However, by 2021 it's believed that the legal North American pot market will have vaulted in value to $21.6 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 26%. If there's a single factor that can be pinpointed for this growth, it'd be the rapid shift in consumer opinion toward marijuana. Gallup, which has taken periodic polls on cannabis' favorability for nearly 50 years, found in 1995 that only a quarter of those surveyed wanted it to be legal across the United States. Of course, this poll was also conducted during the War on Drugs. As of 2016, Gallup's same poll found that an all-time record 60% of respondents want to see it legal nationally. The belief is that as this figure rises, pressure will mount on lawmakers in Congress to adjust their scheduling of the drug. Image source: Getty Images. Paramount to the success of the U.S. legal-weed industry, aside from organic growth in already legal states, is the ability to expand into new states. The 2016 elections saw a nearly ""green"" sweep, with marijuana initiatives and amendments being passed in eight out of nine states (sorry, Arizonans). The chances are decent that the 2018 elections will bring another serious opportunity for adult-use marijuana to be legalized in a handful of states. Of course, we have to remember that not all states have the same voting process. Whereas some states have a referendum and initiative process, whereby residents can gather signatures to introduce and vote on propositions, bills in other states have to be introduced and passed entirely at the legislative level. For instance, both houses of Vermont's legislature voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis earlier this year, however Gov. Phil Scott (R-Vt.) vetoed the measure. Despite presumed strong support for recreational cannabis in Vermont, its residents have no official say in the process, save for voting Scott out of office, should they choose to do so in a future election. Two dozen states in the U.S. lack this referendum and initiative process. So which states are the likeliest to have their residents heading to the polls in 2018 to vote on a recreational marijuana bill? Once we exclude the aforementioned states without a referendum and initiative process, the following three rise clearly to the top of the list. Image source: Getty Images. One of the more interesting quirks of voting on marijuana bills is that the first time isn't always the charm -- but the second time seems to be. In the November 2016 elections, Arizona wound up voting down Prop 205 (52% opposed to 48% in favor), which would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state. However, the margin of loss was close enough that pro-legalization groups are expected to focus their efforts on the state for the 2018 election. History would suggest that Arizona has a decent shot of approval in 2018. Oregon, which is one of the most pro-legalization states in the country, initially failed to legalize an adult-use measure itself when voters went to the polls in 2012. Oregon wound up officially legalizing through a 2014 vote by state residents. The same can be said for Florida, which voted down a medical-marijuana amendment by just 2% in 2014. With a new medical-cannabis amendment on the ballot in 2016, and pro-legalization groups putting a lot of effort into Florida between 2015 and 2016, the measure passed with ease last November. The second time could very well be the charm for Arizonans. Image source: Getty Images. Residents in Michigan have been here before. It appeared that the Wolverine State would have no issues getting a recreational-weed initiative on the 2016 ballots, but they were thwarted by a number of invalid signatures. The upcoming election in 2018 could be redemption for pro-legalization groups. According to MLive.com, as of mid-July the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol (CRMLA) had collected more than 100,000 signatures, which is well on its way to the 252,523 valid signatures needed to get an initiative on the ballot come the 2018 elections. CRMLA spokesman Josh Hovey has suggested that the current momentum could see the pro-legalization group hitting its signature target in four months instead of the six months given to collect valid signatures. If approved, there would be a 10% excise tax and 6% sales tax on legal weed. Polling data also suggests that Michigan presents a compelling case to legalize. A statewide poll of 600 Michigan voters from Marketing Resource Group this past May found that 58% support legalizing adult-use weed, compared to just 36% who opposed it. This is a stark reversal from the 55% who opposed it and 41% who supported the idea of recreational legalization in 2013. Image source: Getty Images. Lastly, Ohioans could head to the polls for a second time in three years in 2018 to vote on recreational marijuana. The last time they went to the polls in November 2015, they voted down Issue 3 with authority (35% to 65%). However, we have to keep in mind that the reason Ohioans voted down Issue 3 was that it had two inherent flaws. To begin with, Issue 3 called for just 10 predetermined sites to grow and manufacture recreational weed. It would have created an oligopoly for some well-to-do backers and ensured that competition stayed out of their way for years. It would have been terrible for Ohio's consumers. The second problem with Issue 3 was that it was a dual medical and recreational marijuana legalization measure. That's never been done before, and it's exceptionally difficult to pull off without the medical infrastructure already in place. The reason 2018 looks so promising is that Ohio's legislature wound up passing a medical-marijuana law in 2016, not too long after Issue 3 was defeated.  By 2018, the state will have about two years of planning under its belt, and presumably around a year of experience with medical cannabis sales and patients. This, along with a focus from pro-legalization groups, could make Ohio a state likely to vote on recreational cannabis next year. ","

64,Brian Stoffel,9072017,Fool,8312017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's no question they're bad for your health. But given their addictive nature, both beer and cigarettes have proven to be investments with enviable returns. That's why so many investors flock to Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD). But which of these dividend-paying stalwarts is a better bet for your portfolio today? While that's not a question that can be answered with 100% certainty, there are ways to getting some more clarity on the decision. If we break it down to three simple categories, the picture gets clearer. Image source: Getty Images This is by far the most important thing to keep an eye on for long-term investors. A sustainable competitive advantage -- otherwise referred to as a ""moat"" -- is what differentiates one company from the next. Because there's nothing prohibiting start-ups from making their own beer or cigarettes, the key moat for both of these companies is the strength of their brands. Given both companies' ubiquity globally, and the apparent pricing power that comes with those brands, I'm calling this one a tie. Winner: Tie The main draw for investors in these companies is the dividend that they pay out. With recognizable brands and comparatively low input costs, they both spit out lots of cash. But while we'll get to those payments in a minute, it's worth considering how much cash the company keeps on hand for a rainy day as well. While such an allocation might be boring, it is also crucial. That's because every company, at one point or another, is bound to experience difficult economic times. Those that have cash on hand have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire weaker rivals at a discount, or outspend the competition into bankruptcy. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet. Here's how these two stack up, keeping in mind that Anheuser is valued at a 25% premium -- via market capitalization -- to Philip Morris. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Philip Morris $7.3 billion $26.6 billion $7 billion $8.1 billion Anheuser-Busch InBev $30 billion $108 billion $4 billion $6.5 billion Data sources: SEC filings and Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. Figures rounded to nearest billion. To be honest, I'm not terribly impressed with either company's balance sheet. While reliable free cash flow means that neither has much to worry about when it comes to meeting their debt obligations, both companies have a fair amount of leverage. Both companies have identical cash-to-debt ratios, but the differentiator is Philip Morris' free cash flow, which is far superior to Anheuser-Busch, even though the latter is a bigger company. Winner: Philip Morris And then we have valuation. There's no one metric that can tell you just how expensive a stock is. Instead, I like to use a number of data points to get a more holistic picture. Company P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Philip Morris 26 23 2.3 Anheuser-Busch InBev 39 35 1.3 Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance, and E*Trade. P/E represents non-GAAP earnings. On the surface it might seem that Philip Morris is cheaper than Anheuser -- on both an earnings and free cash flow basis. But it's important to remember that the latter's numbers are slightly skewed given the acquisition of SAB Miller. That's where the PEG ratio -- which factors normalized growth into the equation -- comes in. On that metric, Anheuser appears to be trading at a 40% discount to Philip Morris. With both companies having relatively similar and strong yields, the scale tips ever-so-slightly in favor of Anheuser-Busch. Winner: Anheuser-Busch InBev So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have strong moats provided by their ubiquitous brands. Philip Morris has the stronger cash flows for now, while investors appear to be getting a better bargain on Anheuser-Busch InBev at current price levels. ","

66,Stratfor analysts,9072017,MarketWatch,8312017,"Published: Sept 3, 2017 3:51 p.m. ET Talks and negotiations between superpowers and North Korea may now be a thing of the past By North Korea appears to have conducted a sixth nuclear test shortly after noon local time on Sept. 3. Initial reports from South Korea say the quake connected to the test measured 5.6 on the Richter scale, larger than the last test, which measured a magnitude of 5.1. Subsequent reports from the U.S. Geological Survey agency said the blast reached a magnitude of 6.3, indicating a significant increase in yield from any of the North’s previous nuclear tests. The test follows Pyongyang’s claim that it had completed the miniaturization of a hydrogen bomb capable of being fitted to an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has repeatedly claimed perfection of hydrogen bomb technology, producing weapons that employ a more powerful fusion reaction, as opposed to the usual fission reaction of North Korea’s more primitive nuclear weapons. Read: North Korea hails ‘perfect success’ of nuclear test This is an important component of the North’s deterrent strategy: It feels it must showcase that it can do significant damage to a city on the U.S. mainland to change U.S. calculus on military action or attempted regime change in North Korea. The North’s 2016 test, when it claimed to have carried out a fusion reaction, was largely dismissed by international observers because of the relatively small size of the seismic wave. Pyongyang claims that it has had to carry out only small tests because it does not have the facilities or space that the United States, China or Russia had for their nuclear tests — North Korea is a small country, and claims that if it tested a larger device underground, it would create risks for the country itself. It is still too early to determine just what Pyongyang tested, whether an enhanced traditional nuclear weapon, or some small-scale hydrogen bomb, but it is clear that the North has not slowed the pace of its nuclear and missile program despite international sanctions, condemnation and warnings from the United States. Explained: What is a hydrogen bomb? From Pyongyang’s perspective, it has a narrow window in these final stages of testing to complete a program before the United States amasses the political will and international support to carry out preventive action. If the test is confirmed as a high-yield hydrogen bomb, it would mark a very significant development for North Korea’s ability to deter U.S. and allied military action. The power of a hydrogen bomb means that the North Koreans would still be able to inflict significant damage to the United States without the need for their missiles to be particularly accurate. It also means that the missile could cause major damage without having to survive reentry, as a high-altitude airburst could still prove devastating, especially to electronic systems. South Korea has already called for a special session of its own National Security Council and it is likely the United States will call for increased sanctions and isolation of the North. China and Russia, however, are likely to call for talks, even if the talks have little long-term ability to reverse the Pyongyang’s path. But as Beijing argues, at least North Korea’s pace of testing slows during talks, slowing the timeline for any potential crisis. But if the North Korean program is advancing at the pace it claims, it may be too late to debate over negotiations or their meaning — the North may be closer than anyone expected to having a viable nuclear deterrent.

The S&P has climbed 10.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 19% since the start of the year. “Biotech rally, which created an upside momentum in the market amid very low volumes, has been driving the market over the past two days,” said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. Some analysts said the market has been supported by earnings and a positive economic environment over the past several months. Thursday’s economic releases came in mostly in line with expectations, confirming a positive trend in growth. Low levels of first-time jobless claims  suggest the labor market remains robust, while consumer spending — the biggest driver of the economy — picked up in July, thanks to higher income for consumers and low inflation. “In an environment where the economy and earnings continue to grow, markets will also climb. Geopolitics shake up markets from time to time, but usually do not have long-lasting impact,” said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial. Equities and other assets viewed as relatively risky have stabilized after a late-August slump thanks in part to that better-than-expected U.S. data and a stronger-than-anticipated reading on Chinese manufacturing out Thursday, according to Richard Perry, a Hantec Markets analyst. Data deluge: Consumer spending rose 0.3% last month, helped by higher incomes and low inflation. The pace of inflation, meanwhile, was little changed in July, up 0.1%. Initial jobless claims in the period running from Aug. 20 to Aug. 26 rose by 1,000 to 236,000, which is still close to a postrecession low, pointing to another solid monthly employment report near the end of summer. The official jobs report will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on Friday. Separately, the Chicago PMI held steady at 58.9 in August.

                                    has rallied from the range bottom, reaching nearly three-week highs. Still, the blue-chip benchmark is firmly lower Tuesday. Tactically, near-term support matches the breakout point (21,912) and is followed by a deeper floor, circa 21,770. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has reached one-month highs. The rally punctuates a break atop major resistance — Nasdaq 6,342 — an area that remains an inflection point, also illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has reclaimed the breakdown point (6,342), rising within striking distance of record territory. Consider that last week’s close (6,435) marked a record, though the Nasdaq’s absolute all-time high (6,460.84) remains just overhead. An immediate breakout would be unexpected against the current backdrop, though the retest is worth tracking. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has rallied from well-defined support. The specific area matches the breakout point (21,682) and the 50-day moving average, currently 21,725. Conversely, the Dow’s record close (22,118) is closely followed by its absolute record peak (22,179). Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has come to life technically. As illustrated, the S&P has reclaimed the 2,453 breakdown point, a level closely matching trendline resistance. This area matches the 50-day moving average, also 2,453, and pivots to support. As partly detailed above, the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive September start. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have reclaimed their breakdown points — S&P 2,453, and Nasdaq 6,342, respectively — rising within striking distance of record territory. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has reversed respectably from three-month lows. In the process, the small-cap benchmark has reclaimed the 200-day moving average, and the tactically more important breakdown point, circa 138.85. A posture within the prevailing range, to the extent it’s sustained, supports a bullish-leaning intermediate- to longer-term bias. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has rallied atop the 200-day moving average, rising to the former range. Tactically, the range bottom, circa 314.60, pivots to support. Slightly more broadly, the small- and mid-cap reversals have been fueled by lighter relative volume versus the early-August downdraft. Meanwhile, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   remains comparably stronger, rising firmly atop the 245 inflection point. In fact, last week’s close (247.84) missed a record close by just three cents. Resistance broadly spans from about 247.80 to 248.90, and the SPY’s response to the range top should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Similarly, the S&P 500’s backdrop remains relatively straightforward, even amid the jagged late-summer price action. Tactically, the S&P has reclaimed the headline 2,453 mark, an area matching trendline resistance and the 50-day moving average. To be sure, the reversal has registered low marks for style, as measured by volume and breadth, though as always, price action trumps other indicators. And when gauging price action, the S&P’s breakout was directionally sharp, placing record territory firmly within view, and technically neutralizing the mid-August downdraft. The S&P 2,450 area pivots to well-defined support, and sustained posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias.

The shares initially stalled four weeks ago, pulling in from a downtrend pinned to the January 2017 peak. The downturn placed the shares at one-month lows, and has been punctuated by a successful test of the range bottom (9.32). Tactically, the downtrend defines major resistance — currently matching the 10.00 area — and a retest is underway Tuesday. A posture lower supports a bearish longer-term technical bias, though this week's price action should add color.

Recall that the upturn resolves a bullish double bottom, the “W” formation defined by the May and July lows. Tactically, gap support closely matches the breakout point, circa 123.30, and a posture higher supports a firmly-bullish bias.

The trendline subsequently offered support. More recently, the shares have extended the breakout, clearing the 200-day moving average amid a sustained volume spike.

Technically, the shares have rallied from a tight six-week range, notching a nominal all-time high. To be sure, the slight breakout has been fueled by decreased volume following a three-month distribution phase. (Very generally, the summer downturns have been fueled by increased volume, and punctuated by lighter-volume rallies.) Still, the price action is constructive, opening the path to uncharted territory, and potential follow-through. The former range bottom closely matched the 50-day moving average, and a posture higher supports a bullish bias.

Saefong,9072017,MarketWatch,8312017,"Published: Sept 7, 2017 3:20 p.m. ET WTI prices set for weekly rise as some U.S. Gulf Coast refineries restart operations By U.S. oil prices closed lower Thursday after the U.S. government reported the first climb for domestic crude inventories in 10 weeks, of U.S. stocks data, as Gulf storm Harvey caused refinery shutdowns in Texas, reducing demand for the commodity. Gasoline futures eased back for a fourth-straight session, despite a hefty weekly drop in U.S. stockpiles, with refinery capacity improving as floodwaters from the storm recede.

Early Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude supplies climbed by 4.6 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 1. The rise followed nine-consecutive weeks of declines. Forecasts for the supply data differed somewhat. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts forecast a rise of 2.7 million barrels for crude stocks, but a survey from The Wall Street Journal showed expectations for a larger rise of 5 million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday that U.S. crude supplies rose 2.8 million barrels last week. Crude-oil refinery inputs fell by 3.3 million barrels a day last week, to average 14.5 million barrels a day, while refineries operated at just 79.7% of capacity, the EIA said. “We do expect to see [crude] demand destruction not only in the Texas region but also in Florida with the impact of [Hurricane] Irma,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. “We do feel we will continue to see crude oil builds in the weeks to come due to the demand destruction and especially since we are past the summer driving season.” He expects to “continue to see builds [for crude supplies] in the weeks to come as we see refineries slowly come back online and we are also going to refinery maintenance season.” Gasoline stockpiles were down 3.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles edged down by 1.4 million barrels, according to the EIA. The S&P Global Platts survey showed forecasts for declines of 4.2 million in gasoline and 1.9 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.

Traders were also monitoring the development of Hurricane Irma which is heading toward Florida, where oil and gasoline demand could be affected. GasBuddy has been reporting big shortages of fuel at Florida gas stations ahead of the storm, with 41% of Gainesville stations without gas Thursday afternoon. Read: Hurricane Irma set to squeeze a lot more than just Florida’s oranges “So far, this [Atlantic] hurricane season has certainly had an extraordinary impact on the energy market, but almost exclusively thanks to Hurricane Harvey,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report, told MarketWatch. “WTI was hit hard in the wake of Harvey’s landfall as a substantial percentage of Gulf Coast refineries were shut, essentially cutting oil demand by between 15% and 20%.” As of late Wednesday, about 12.7% of U.S. refining capacity remained down, according to S&P Global Platts. Separate data from the energy and commodities information provider showed that crude output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in August for the first time in five months. The group produced 32.65 million barrels a day in August, down 170,000 barrels a day from July. Natural-gas prices, meanwhile, saw a modest decline after separate EIA data Thursday showed that domestic supplies of the commodity rose by 65 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 1. That matched the average forecast of analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts.

70,Myra P. Saefong,9072017,MarketWatch,8312017,"Published: Aug 31, 2017 7:49 p.m. ET 1 million barrels of oil can produce half a million barrels of gasoline By U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry authorized an emergency release of oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Thursday in an effort to ease shortages of gasoline in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, but analysts doubt it will have much impact. I authorized the SPR to execute an emergency exchange agreement authorizing crude oil to be drawn down from @ENERGY site. #Harvey Statement: pic.twitter.com/9TQXwiQfmd Perry first authorized a release of 500,000 barrels of crude oil from the emergency oil reserve early Thursday. A spokeswoman said it would be delivered directly by pipeline directly to the Phillips 66 refinery in Lake Charles, La. “This is a drop in the bucket,” said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. It “won’t do much” and while it will be enough oil for two days of operations, “we need the Port of Houston to open to make a notable difference.” On Thursday afternoon, the Energy Department announced the release of another 500,000 barrels of oil from the reserve, taking the total release to 1 million barrels. “Hurricane Harvey has been far more devastating for U.S. energy infrastructure than anyone could have imagined even a week ago,” said Dave Ernsberger, global head of energy at S&P Global Platts. He said the SPR is “often criticized in the industry because it usually ends up offering to provide more crude, on an emergency basis, when what the market really needs is refined products like gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.” But “the scale of the storm is so massive that this could be the first time in a long time when crude supplies might be increasingly tapped in to,” said Ernsberger. “No crude vessels have called into Houston [ports] for five days, and it might be quite some time before they do again.” So let’s do the math: U.S. refineries produced an average of about 20 gallons of motor gasoline and about of 11 gallons of ultralow sulfur distillate fuel oil from one 42-gallon barrel of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. Many other petroleum products are refined from crude oil. But if you look at just gasoline, that 1 million barrels of oil would produce about half a million barrels of gasoline, according to James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics. The amount of oil could feed refinery operations for around 4 days and “make enough gasoline to fuel U.S. autos for an hour and 15 minutes,” he said. In 2016, U.S. drivers consumed about 143.37 billion gallons, or about 3.41 billion barrels, of finished motor gasoline, according to the EIA, a daily average of about 391.73 million gallons, or 9.33 million barrels. At the retail level, the average price per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline stood at $2.482 late Thursday afternoon, according to GasBuddy. That’s up 13 cents from last week’s average. Read: Why September’s gasoline futures contract has left October’s in the dust The SPR release shows that refineries still in operation are having a hard time finding crude, or at least the grade of crude they need, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. “With refining margins soaring, refiners are going to be paying up to get their hands on crude,” he said. Many domestic and international refiners will be putting off maintenance, helping drive demand for crude. If gasoline prices continue to soar, “crude prices will be dragged higher.” On Thursday, October West Texas Intermediate crude

There was no settlement for oil and gasoline Monday because of the Labor Day holiday. “What happens next in the energy markets will be all about how quickly the refineries come back online, and when downstream operations are restored to normal,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report. “If the damage keeps refineries shut, expect further volatility and notable strength in the refined products, while a return to normal operations would be demand-side bullish for oil, and would see the products’ bid unwind.” As of late Sunday, about 17% of total U.S. refinery capacity remained shut, according to S&P Global Platts. Motiva Enterprises’s Port Arthur, Texas refinery, the nation’s largest, is in the initial phases of a refinery start up, according to a company statement Tuesday. Motiva expects the refinery to initially return to approximately 40% production by the end of this weekend. Demand for crude is set to rise as refinery capacity recovers, while the shortage that has buoyed gasoline prices is likely to ease. Analysts at Commerzbank pointed out that Labor Day marked the end of the summer driving season in the U.S., “so the market focus is likely to move away from gasoline again.” “Generally speaking, little attention should be paid in the next few weeks to reports of crude and oil product stocks and trade given the numerous short-term disruptions,” they said. Inventory data for last week will be published by the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday, delayed a day due to the holiday. Official supply figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration are slated for Thursday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma in the Atlantic is bearing down, “and if the expected track begins to favor a Gulf landfall, expect speculation bids to come flowing into the energy space again, including natural gas, which traded well last week on the weather-related drama and a less-reported bullish development in supply,” said Richey. For now, forecasters expect the storm to affect Florida.

Let’s start with Europe, the world’s second-largest economy. The European Union is a collection of states that are vastly different from one another. They are separated by culture, language (which impedes labor mobility, resulting in semipermanent labor productivity disparity between countries — think Greece and Germany), economic growth rates, indebtedness and history. European political (EU) and monetary (EMU) unions were great experiments that made a lot of sense on paper. Europe, at roughly the same-size population and economy as the U.S., was at a competitive disadvantage as dozens of currencies embedded extra transaction costs in cross-border trade, and each currency on its own had little chance of competing with the U.S. dollar

Germans were haunted by their past; they had started two world wars in the 20th century, and a united Europe was their way of lowering the risk of future European wars. Economic and monetary union sounded like a logical marriage of all the significant powers of post–World War II Europe, but the arrangement was never really a marriage. It was more like a civil union. EMU members combined their currencies into one, the euro

Read:  The world is becoming desperate about deflation Though treaties put limits on budget deficits (limits that, ironically, Germany was the first to exceed), each country went on spending its money as it wished. Some were relatively frugal (like Germany); others (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) went on spending binges, like newly hitched college students who had just gotten their first credit card, with an irresistibly low introductory rate and a free T-shirt. Now let’s turn to Brexit, the U.K. referendum on exiting the EU. Ironically, the U.K. doesn’t have half the problems that most EU nations are going through. Because it is not part of the EMU, it has retained its currency and its central bank. The U.K.’s main dissatisfaction with EU membership stems from the immigration issue. Because treaties have turned the EU into a borderless union, when Germany accepted refugees from the Middle East and Northern Africa, it basically made a unilateral decision on behalf of all EU members to accept those refugees to all EU countries. High unemployment, wage stagnation and terrorism are now endemic in the EU, and you can see how the U.K.’s citizenry might have a problem with this. After the Brexit vote, the financial media lit up with opinions on its consequences for the EU and the global economy. They’ve varied from “Brexit is a nonevent” to “This is a Lehman moment for the global economy,” referring to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that almost brought the financial system to a halt in 2008. The arguments on both sides are quite convincing. The argument for Brexit’s being a nonevent is simple and straightforward. The U.K. maintained its currency, and the pound’s

                                   decline in the aftermath of the referendum will help cushion any negative fallout on the British economy. The U.K. and the EU will forge new trade treaties. There is a fear that the EU may impose trade sanctions on U.K., not so much to punish the U.K. but to threaten other EU members that exit will come at a stiff economic cost (effectively turning this voluntary club into a prison). However, the U.K. is a net importer of goods from the EU; thus any sanctions will hurt remaining EU members more than the U.K. The Lehman moment argument is less simple, but not unimaginable. Brexit may provide the spark that will ignite already gasoline-soaked ground. Though the EU and EMU were supposed to unite Europeans, they may have had the opposite effect — causing a groundswell of nationalism. In all honesty, Italy is more concerning than the U.K. Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU, and its debt stands at 132% of GDP, second only to Greece (171%). Seventeen percent of Italian bank loans are noncurrent. In the depths of the financial crisis, that number was 5% in the U.S. Italian lenders account for nearly half of bad debt in the EU. If Italy was not part of the EMU, it could just print lire and bail out its banks. But it gave up that luxury when it joined the single currency. To make things worse, in 2014 the EU passed a law that prohibits governments from bailing out their banking systems; thus the shareholders, debtholders, and depositors may bear the brunt of the eventual bailout. Unless the EU passes a new law that bends the 2014 law — or the Italian government takes matters into its own hands, violating EU rules — we may see Italian debtholders and depositors hit with the cost of bank bailouts take to the streets and demand “Italexit.” Nationalism is a highly emotional, zero-sum, us-against-them sort of business. Add immigration concerns on top of economic ones, and it’s not hard to see how Europe has turned into a highly combustible mixture looking for a match. And because emotions are often antilogical, future decisions by EU countries may not necessarily be beneficial to the European Continent. Given that the situation in Europe is so complex and combustible, it’s unclear whether Brexit will be just another match that simply burns out or the one that starts the fire. Will it trigger other exits? Will it slow down EU growth, thus straining an already leveraged system? No one knows. Meanwhile, China is the world’s second-largest economy and is experiencing the largest debt bubble we’ll probably ever see in our lifetimes. From 2007 to 2014, the country’s debt quadrupled, to $28 trillion from $7 trillion. Over the same period, China’s economy grew to $10.5 trillion from $3.5 trillion. These numbers are staggering and point to one indisputable fact: All Chinese growth since 2007 has come from borrowing. There was no miracle in it. But it gets worse, much worse. The numbers also show that every $1 of new debt brought only pennies of GDP growth. In the absence of skyrocketing debt, the Chinese overcapacity bubble, which was already fully inflated pre-2007, would have burst years ago. As the government continues to engineer growth by borrowing, every yuan of debt will bring less growth. The laws of economics have not been suspended in China. American economist Herbert Stein’s law states that things that cannot go on forever, won’t. When its debt bubble bursts, China will become a headwind for global growth. This brings us to Japan. It is the most-indebted developed nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 230%. Japan is the proof of Stein’s law — its economy is still suffering a hangover from what at the time seemed like an endless real estate party (bubble) that lasted from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s. Japan has been on the quantitative easing and endless stimulus bandwagon longer than anyone else and has nothing (except a lot of debt) to show for it. Japan also has the oldest population in the world — 26% of its people are older than 65 (in the U.S. the figure is 15%). Rising debt and an aging population are a double negative for the economy, as debt per capita is rising at an even faster rate than total debt. And since the working population is declining at an even faster rate than the population as a whole, debt per working person is growing at an even faster rate. Given this reality, you might think Japan is paying the highest interest rates in the world, perhaps somewhere in the high teens. Wrong. The Japanese 10-year goverment bond carries a negative yield. This is an overview of the challenging environment facing investors around the world. It’s evident that stock market performance has not been driven by the improving health of the global economy. Just as negative interest rates are not a positive for the continued health of the economy, current stock market performance does not augur rosy future returns for stocks. In fact, the opposite is true. So, how does one invest in this overvalued market? Our strategy is spelled out    in this fairly lengthy article.

Increasingly, however, fund providers are trying to offer ways for investors to express their thoughts on politics through where they put their money. One proposed fund, the Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF holds companies that are seen as sympathetic to the Republican Party. The ticker, MAGA, is a reference to “make America great again,” the slogan that President Donald Trump used in his successful White House run. It wasn’t clear when the fund might begin trading. According to a June filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund will track an index of companies “whose employees and political action committees are highly supportive of Republican candidates for election to the United States Congress, the Vice Presidency, or the Presidency and related Republican Party committees,” including the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as well as Republican leadership PACs. The index the fund tracks will look at the components of the S&P 500

Currently, the Republican Party controls both the White House and both houses of Congress, along with a majority of governorships and state legislatures. In an updated filing on Wednesday, Point Bridge wrote that the fund would charge an annual expense ratio of 0.72%, or $72 for every $10,000 invested. That is significantly higher than what is charged for other funds with a large-cap U.S. stock focus, which with it will likely have a large overlap in the names held, though the proportions will be different.

The filing didn’t say what securities would be held in the fund, instead directing individuals to the website “www.investpolitically.com”, where it said daily portfolio holdings would be available. That link, as of Thursday, simply features a place for users to log in, as well as a tagline, “Shhhh... We must be very very quiet.” Point Bridge was listed as the fund’s adviser, with Vident Investment Advisory listed as the sub-advisor. Denise Krisko, Vident’s president, was named as the portfolio manager. She did not immediately return a request for a comment. This is not the first time a politically themed ETF has been suggested. In April, Event Shares, a new ETF issuer, filed for a Republican Policies Fund, a Democratic Policies Fund, a U.S. Tax Reform Fund and a fund that is designed to rise if the European Union breaks up. All four are actively managed, which means their holdings will be handpicked by a manager, as opposed to tracking an index. Read more: Would you buy a GOP ETF? You may soon get the chance The Point Bridge ETF appears to differ from the proposed Event Shares product by focusing on companies that donate to Republican parties, as opposed to ones that a portfolio manager — the Event Shares funds were designed to be actively managed, as opposed to tracking an index — would outperform because Republican politicians were in office.

75,Jason Notte,9072017,MarketWatch,8312017,"Published: Sept 1, 2017 10:16 a.m. ET ‘Lifestyle’ beers such as Corona, Dos Equis and Kona are among the biggest sellers in the U.S. By The beer industry has a phrase for beers that have become inextricably tied to images of sun, blue ocean and relaxation: lifestyle beers. On its own, Corona Extra is a yellow lager produced in Mexico and packaged in a clear flint bottle. However, for about three decades, its handlers in the United States have done everything in their power to connect drinkers’ perceptions of that beer to rolling waves, white sand and a wedge of lime in the bottle.

                                   says Corona’s evolution from a Mexican beer to the “Corona way of living” and “passport to carefree enjoyment” was started by drinkers themselves. U.S. spring breakers coming back from Mexican beach resorts brought memories of the beer with them. Spring breakers “We saw that consumers’ first interaction with the brand was in Mexico,” Alvarado said. “It was before we’d started importing it to the U.S., and that experience was largely around a vacation in a beautiful setting.” However, spring breakers’ memories tend to be a little fuzzy. Corona’s ad agency at the time, Campbell Mithun Esty (CME), decided that maybe beer-swilling college students weren’t ideal pitchmen for Corona and steered the brand’s add campaign toward serene, sometimes-irreverent images of Gulf Coast beaches. The resulting campaign carved out Corona’s personality and lingers in a palm-tree-laden ad that’s aired during every holiday season for the past 27 years. It’s also made generations of beer drinkers entirely comfortable with throwing a twist of lime into their light lager. In 2010, ad agency Cramer-Krasselt tweaked the Corona formula into “Find your beach,” making concerts, rooftop parties, a Sunday in the stadium with the Los Angeles Rams or University of Texas Longhorns (both sponsored by Corona) or the local bar the vacation destination Corona drinkers envision. As new “A Corona Gets its Lime” ads make clear, Constellation Brands’ lifestyle focus is less about where drinkers enjoy their beer and more about their reaction to it. “The lime ritual does a lot of work for us as the trigger to inspire those carefree enjoyment moments,” Alvarado says. “That ritual does a lot in terms of the physical, when they put the lime into the bottle and enhance the refreshing benefit of the product, but there’s also the emotional side of that: That sense of “ah” when they push the lime down that inspires them to find their beach and find those experiences.” Top-selling import That broad idea, not tethered to any one place, has made Corona an invaluable commodity.

It was so valuable, in fact, that Anheuser-Busch still paid that price even after the Justice Department ruled that it would be in violation of antitrust law if it didn’t sell the U.S. rights to the Grupo Modelo brand. Corona’s U.S. distributor, Constellation Brands, picked up those rights for $4.75 billion and set up its own brewing facility (with another on the way this year) and glass bottle plant in Mexico. Corona has been the top-selling import brand in the U.S. for the past 20 years. However, since its U.S. rights were sold to Constellation Brands, sales have increased by more than 1 million barrels. The nearly 8.5 million barrels sold last year not only makes Corona the fifth-largest brand in the U.S., but would make it the third-largest brewery in the U.S. if the brand split from Constellation Brands entirely. ‘Interesting’ beer It’s bigger than all of Heineken’s

                                   U.S. sales, but it isn’t for lack of trying on Heineken’s part. With help from years of commercials and memes featuring “The Most Interesting Man in the World,” Heineken’s Dos Equis brand also skews into “lifestyle brand” territory. In contrast with Heineken’s Tecate, which Heineken chief marketing officer Nuno Teles says is targeted toward Mexican-American drinkers and markets, Dos Equis relies on both its Mexican roots and a heavy dose of adventure-driven marketing to associate itself with a somewhat higher-octane version of Corona’s “beach.” “The Dos Equis brand stands for ‘seek interesting’ and is all about seeking a more interesting life,” says Teles. “Consumers are afraid of having nothing to say to their friends in social context and often say they’d rather be dead than dull.” It’s been effective. Dos Equis sales have increased nearly 33% since 2013, while sales through the first six months of this year alone are up 4.2%, according to Chicago-based market-research firm IRI. While it still sells roughly half as much beer as Heineken’s namesake brand, it’s far outpacing Heineken’s 1.4% growth in the first half of the year. That daydream “lifestyle” narrative has driven Mexican beer brands, which Nielsen says accounted for $4.4 billion of the $6.8 billion spent on imported beers in 2016. According to the Brewers Association craft beer industry group, it’s also pushing sales of imports ahead of those of small brewers. While the breweries that the Brewers Association considers “craft” saw sales increase 6.2% last year, import sales rose 6.8% during that span. Kona’s island connection If the Brewers Association’s numbers included the Portland, Ore.-based Craft Brew Alliance’s Kona brand, however, craft’s growth might look a little different. Excluded because Anheuser-Busch InBev owns a more than a 30% stake in the Craft Brew Alliance (CBA), Kona was purchased by CBA in 2010 after years of partnering with the group on production, packaging and marketing. Initially intended as a supplement to Pacific Northwest beer brands Widmer Brothers and Redhook, Kona accounted for 397,000 barrels of CBA’s 748,900 barrels of production in 2016 — more than shrinking, regionalizing Redhook and Widmer Brothers combined. That was 12.9% growth year over year and nearly 33% more beer than the Kona brand sold in 2014. CBA Chief Executive Andy Thomas, who was a consultant with CBA when it purchased Kona in 2010, says he expects sales of Kona to reach upwards of 450,000 barrels in 2017, but he didn’t necessarily see this success coming. “For me, Kona has always been about the islands not because they’re commercially viable, but because that’s who [Kona] was,” he says. “Also, popularity is a funny thing: You don’t know what’s going to be popular until it’s popular, otherwise we’d all just go to Vegas and bet on the right numbers.” It makes it slightly easier to hedge those bets when you play to a beer’s strengths. During Kona’s early years on the mainland, it gained traction in states including California, Oregon and Washington with help from drinkers’ attachment to the island. Whether they were from the islands themselves or frequent vacationers from the West Coast, the name and imagery connecting Kona to Hawaii’s big island resonated with consumers and provided an opening for CBA. Four years ago, CBA enlisted ad agency Duncan Channon to create its “Dear Mainland” ads featuring two Hawaiian brothers offering polite suggestions on how to relax. Around that time, it also changed the labeling on bottles and packages of Kona, streamlined the number of beers the brand offered and began selling it in bottles molded with the brand’s “Liquid Aloha” slogan and the Hawaiian Islands themselves. “Our procurement people would love for us to go with a stock bottle, which we used to be in, but it’s a matter of picking your battles,” Thomas says. “Are you going to spend money or build in inherent inefficiencies that are valuable in the long term. We happen to believe that the Liquid Aloha bottles speak to people and we have the confidence that, once they’re spoken to and answer the call, they’re going to come back because the beer keeps the promise that it makes to them.” Part of fulfilling that promise includes putting a hefty dose of Galaxy and Citra hops into Kona’s flagship Big Wave Golden Ale to mimic pineapple, passionfruit and other tropical fruits to evoke the flavors of the islands. The other is to be honest about the illusion that’s being created. Though Kona has a brewer in Kona itself and is expanding it to nearly 100,000 barrels of capacity by 2019, there isn’t a bottling facility on the Big Island large enough to handle more production and the trip across the Pacific to the mainland can be rough on beer. That means a whole lot of Kona is made in the lower 48 states, which resulted in a lawsuit claiming that Kona was deceiving consumers about its brewing location. However, Kona bottles are clearly marked with multiple point of beer origin, including Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Colorado. What’s clear is that a “lifestyle” beer has to fulfill a promise to drinkers. “That experience is something that, across demographics from millennials to boomers to Gen X and across ethnicities, really resonates,” says Alvarado of Constellation Brands. “We make sure that we depict the world in a way that’s inviting to those consumers relative to the world that they live in today.” Jason Notte is a freelance writer based in Portland, Ore.

Mourinho says he loves the packed Christmas schedule that English teams have and believes they cannot use the busy schedule as an excuse for poor Champions League performances. “We have no winter break, and in other countries there is a winter break, but that’s cultural - it means a lot, and I have to admit I love it,” he added. “But no complaining this is what we have, we have squads and if we think they’re tired we play with other players.” Mourinho also said he was not surprised by the sacking of Crystal Palace manager Frank de Boer after just four league games in charge. “In football, nothing surprises me. I was sacked as a champion, (Claudio) Ranieri was sacked as a champion, Frank de Boer is sacked after four games,” Mourinho said. “Next season something incredible will happen again.” Defenders Eric Bailly and Phil Jones are serving suspensions and will be replaced by Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof at the centre of defence for Tuesday’s game, while midfielder Marouane Fellaini is a doubt as he recovers from a calf injury.

78,,9142017,Reuters,9072017,"LONDON, (Reuters) - Proposed United States budget cuts could put in jeopardy great progress in reducing global poverty and disease and lead to 5 million more deaths from AIDS alone, the philanthropist Bill Gates warned on Wednesday. Gates, whose Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a major provider of global health and development funding, said there was currently “more doubt than usual about the world’s commitment to development”. A global health report by the foundation, co-authored by the Gates and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME), analyzed progress against diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. It also tracked rates of poverty, maternal and infant death, access to contraception, sanitation and other development issues. Forecasting good and bad future scenarios, it found millions of lives hanging in the balance. In a telephone briefing about the findings, Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation, said remarkable progress had been made in recent decades but that shifting priorities, instability and potential budget cuts could lead the world to turn away, jeopardizing the gains. HIV, which currently infects almost 37 million people worldwide, is an “iconic example”, Gates said, “because the world really did step up with an incredible level of generosity which has meant (annual) AIDS-related deaths have fallen by almost a half since the peak in 2005.” The Gates IHME analysis, called the Goalkeepers report, forecast that a 10 percent cut in global donor funding for HIV treatment could mean more than 5 million extra deaths by 2030. Under budget proposals from U.S. President Donald Trump released in May, U.S. funding for global health programs including efforts on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria would see a 24 percent cut to about $6.5 billion for 2018. But opposition Democrats and many of Trump’s fellow Republicans have blasted his plan, saying they will reject it. Congress, not the administration, controls U.S. spending. Gates said his foundation is working hard to secure continued U.S. government funding for global health and development and remained hopeful the proposed cuts will not be  approved.

The global market for consumer health products is worth an estimated $233 billion in sales this year, according to Euromonitor International, which ranks Merck’s business in the sector as the 32nd biggest, with a 0.4 percent share. One source said Merck was eyeing a price of 5 billion euros, while others said that 4 billion euros would be too ambitious because the business lacks global reach. Analysts at Bernstein have put a price tag of 3.7-5.6 billion euros on the business. Consumer health is very fragmented and has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand. Nestle, which wants to become a “nutrition, health and wellness company,” recently said it would pursue opportunities to expand in the sector. Merck, which confirmed JP Morgan’s role but declined to comment on other aspects of the process, prefers an outright sale of the business, which owns brands such as Bion nutritional supplements and decongestant Nasivin, the sources said.

Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid “anti-American rhetoric by officials”. “Are you scaring Cambodians?” Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States. “Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that’s why you told Americans to be careful? It’s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,” Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education.

81,,9142017,Reuters,9072017,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia on Thursday defended its anti-narcotics efforts after U.S. President Donald Trump said he considered downgrading the country in a White House assessment because of an uptick in the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient for cocaine. Tens of millions of dollars in development and security funding and logistical help could be in danger should the United States decide the South American country is not doing enough, and such a decision could even jeopardize Colombia’s access to monies from multilateral organizations. The two countries have long been close allies in the fight against illegal narcotics but in recent years have broadened the focus of their relationship to include trade and Colombia’s peace process with leftist guerrillas. However, Trump said this week he had contemplated declaring in the White House’s annual review of countries it considers hubs for narcotics trafficking that Colombia is not meeting its drug fight obligations because of decade-high coca production. The government of President Juan Manuel Santos took issue with Trump’s statement. “Colombia is without a doubt the country which most has fought drugs, and which has had the most success on that front,” the government said in an early morning statement. “No one has to threaten us to confront this challenge.” In the last seven years, the country has confiscated 1,621 tonnes of cocaine, the statement said. The United States has expressed its worry about a sharp uptick in coca cultivation and cocaine production at the close of last year, after Colombia signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), its largest rebel group, and halted the spraying of powerful herbicide glyphosate over health worries. Coca cultivation was up to 188,000 hectares (464,000 acres), while cocaine production capacity climbed to 700 tonnes annually, the highest figures for at least a decade. Colombia is counting on more than $400 million in funding help from the United States for implementing the FARC deal and has rejected the possibility of restarting fumigation with glyphosate, something Washington has backed. Instead, Colombia favors manual eradication and crop substitution in concert with rural communities, as agreed upon in the FARC deal. The country is planning to manually eliminate 50,000 hectares of coca. Rebel groups, right-wing paramilitaries and crime gangs have all been involved in drug trafficking during Colombia’s five-decade conflict, which has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions from their homes.

82,,9142017,Reuters,9072017,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At least 1.4 million people uprooted by Boko Haram’s insurgency in northeast Nigeria are living in ‘cholera hotspots’, prey to an outbreak of the deadly disease which is sweeping through camps for the displaced, the United Nations said on Thursday. An estimated 28 people have died from cholera in the conflict-hit region, while about 837 are suspected to have been infected with the disease, including at least 145 children under the age of five, said the U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF). The outbreak was first identified last week in the Muna Garage camp in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, which is the heart of jihadist group Boko Haram’s brutal eight-year campaign to carve out an Islamic caliphate in northeast Nigeria. About 1.8 million people have abandoned their homes because of violence or food shortages, U.N. agencies say, and many live in camps for the displaced throughout northeast Nigeria. Several aid agencies last month told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that Nigeria’s rainy season could spread disease in already unsanitary displacement camps, and 350,000 uprooted children aged under five are at risk of cholera, UNICEF said. “Cholera is difficult for young children to withstand at any time, but becomes a crisis for survival when their resilience is already weakened by malnutrition, malaria and other waterborne diseases,” UNICEF’s Pernille Ironside said in a statement. “Cholera is one more threat amongst many that children in northeast Nigeria are battling today in order to survive,” added Ironside, UNICEF’s deputy representative in Nigeria. UNICEF said aid agencies have set up a cholera treatment centre at the Muna Garage camp, chlorinated water in camps and host communities to curb the outbreak, and mobilised volunteers and local leaders to refer suspected cases to health facilities. The disease, which spreads through contaminated food and drinking water, causes diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. It can kill within hours if left untreated, but most patients recover if treated promptly with oral rehydration salts. The latest figures represent a 3.3 percent fatality rate - well above the 1 percent rate that the World Health Organization rates as an emergency. The short incubation period of two hours to five days means the disease can spread with explosive speed. More than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, at least 2.2 million have been displaced, and 5.2 million in the northeast are short of food, with tens of thousands living in famine-like conditions, U.N. figures show.

If the deal goes ahead, it will further boost Allianz’s presence in emerging markets and give the global insurer a stronger position in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a market seen as ripe for consolidation. Abu Dhabi Investment Council might hire an adviser for the deal, one of the sources said. The council is an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, with holdings in several listed companies such as First Abu Dhabi Bank and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank . Its mandate includes diversifying Abu Dhabi’s economy and the development of the corporate sector. The sale plan is still in its preliminary stages, one of the sources said, but could attract more bidders. It is the latest indication of a shake-up in the fiercely competitive local insurance market that has been suffering amid tighter regulations and losses. French insurance giant AXA Group and its UAE partner, Kanoo Group, in 2014 became major shareholders in Abu Dhabi-based Green Crescent Insurance Co. Zurich Insurance Group decided to exit its general insurance business in the UAE in 2016 after a review concluded the investment needed was not justified by its growth potential. The UAE’s third-biggest insurer by assets, ADNIC has a market value of about $377 million, valuing Abu Dhabi Investment Council’s 24 percent stake at about $90 million. The insurance firm bolstered its capital position last year by selling convertible bonds, prompting rating agency Standard & Poor’s to remove it from its creditwatch list with negative implications. Earlier this year, ADNIC also posted its first annual profit in three years for 2016, a sign the company is turning a corner and that it might be a good time to attract an international insurer as its partner, the sources said. In the UAE, gross written premiums, or the total value of premiums written by an insurer before commissions and other deductions, hit 40 billion dirhams ($11 billion) in 2016, up from 37 billion dirhams in 2015 and 33.4 billion in 2014, according to the UAE Insurance Authority. The recent introduction of mandatory health insurance in Dubai has helped boost demand despite a regional economic slowdown and the impact of building fires in the city. Abu Dhabi unveiled mandatory insurance a decade ago. The Allianz Group, one of the world’s leading insurers and asset managers with more than 86 million retail and corporate customers, declined to comment. Last month, the Munich-based company agreed to buy 98 percent of Nigerian insurer Ensure Insurance Plc. Abu Dhabi Investment Council and ADNIC did not respond to requests for comment. ","

86,,9142017,Investopedia,9072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A subsidy is a benefit given to an individual, business or institution, usually by the government. It is usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy. A subsidy takes the form of a payment, provided directly or indirectly, which provides a concession to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver, or promote a particular action by providing financial support. A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation’s economy. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them, or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy, or may be undercut by activities in rival economies. Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current market rate, resulting in a savings for those the subsidy is designed to help. There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are welfare payments and unemployment benefits.  The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.  Other subsidies, such as student loans, are given to encourage people to further their education. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, a number of U.S. families became eligible for health-care subsidies, based on household income and size. These subsidies are designed to lower the out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household. Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.  Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone towards four industries: agriculture, financial institutions, oil companies and utilities companies. Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies; some are economic, some are political and some come from socio-economic development theory. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit. Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a mixed economy. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies, and by extension, the degree to which an economy should be a mixed one. Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to help support businesses and the jobs they create.  Other economists feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails; if it fails, those resources are allocated to a more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources. Subsidies: The Pros Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the ""socially optimal"" level of goods and services. In contemporary neoclassical economic models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical equilibrium level – an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a ""market failure."" One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being under supplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, the market failure should be corrected. In other words, according to general equilibrium theory, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area: They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels. There are many goods or services that allegedly provide what economists call ""positive externalities."" A positive externality is achieved whenever a transaction between two parties provides an indirect benefit to a third party. Many subsidies are implemented to promote positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. Some theories of development argue that the governments of less-developed countries should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations currently. Subsidies: The Cons Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones. Similar concerns come from those who suggest economic calculation is too inexact and microeconomic models are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim they will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim. Another problem, antagonists say: The act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of regulatory capture and rent-seeking, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to government to shield themselves from competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers. Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, and so creates an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries. There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. Policymakers, however, might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense, but still achieve cultural or political goals. An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the Great Depression. Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both set price floors on agricultural products and paid farmers to not produce. Their policy goal was to stop food prices from falling and to protect small farmers. To this extent, the subsidy was a success. But the economic effect was quite different. Artificially high food prices lowered the standard of living for consumers and forced people to spend more on food than they otherwise would have. Those outside of the farm industry were worse off in absolute economic terms. Sometimes both the economic and political results of a subsidy appears to indicate failure. In 2012 and 2013, the Department of Energy (DOE) gave out more than $60 billion in subsidies to renewable (non-oil-based) forms of energy. The DOE anticipated that oil prices would keep increasing, and jump-starting renewable sources could slow dependence on oil. However, the receiving companies failed to turn a profit and oil prices dropped in 2014. Henry Hazlitt, a mid-20th century American business and financial journalist often remarked that bad economics was concerned with only the visible effects, while good economics looked at both the seen and unseen. Subsidies are a classic example of seen versus unseen. Subsidies have an opportunity cost. Take again that Depression Era agricultural subsidy. It had very visible effects; farmers saw profits rise and hired more workers. The invisible costs included what would have happened with all of those dollars without the subsidy. Money from the subsidies had to be taxed from individual income, and consumers were hit again when they faced higher food prices at the grocery store. ",Subsidy Definition | Investopedia,0.9885

It is usually in the form of a cash payment or a tax reduction. The subsidy is typically given to remove some type of burden, and it is often considered to be in the overall interest of the public, given to promote a social good or an economic policy. A subsidy takes the form of a payment, provided directly or indirectly, which provides a concession to the receiving individual or business entity. Subsidies are generally seen as a privileged type of financial aid, as they lessen an associated burden that was previously levied against the receiver, or promote a particular action by providing financial support. A subsidy typically supports particular sectors of a nation’s economy. It can assist struggling industries by lowering the burdens placed on them, or encourage new developments by providing financial support for the endeavors. Often, these areas are not being effectively supported through the actions of the general economy, or may be undercut by activities in rival economies. Direct subsidies are those that involve an actual payment of funds toward a particular individual, group or industry. Indirect subsidies are those that do not hold a predetermined monetary value or involve actual cash outlays. They can include activities such as price reductions for required goods or services that can be government-supported. This allows the needed items to be purchased below the current market rate, resulting in a savings for those the subsidy is designed to help. There are many forms of subsidies given out by the government. Two of the most common types of individual subsidies are welfare payments and unemployment benefits.  The objective of these types of subsidies is to help people who are temporarily suffering economically.  Other subsidies, such as student loans, are given to encourage people to further their education. With the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, a number of U.S. families became eligible for health-care subsidies, based on household income and size. These subsidies are designed to lower the out-of-pocket costs for health insurance premiums. In these instances, the funds associated with the subsidies are sent directly to the insurance company to which premiums are due, lowering the payment amount required from the household. Subsidies to businesses are given to support an industry that is struggling against international competition that has lowered prices, such that the domestic business is not profitable without the subsidy.  Historically, the vast majority of subsidies in the United States have gone towards four industries: agriculture, financial institutions, oil companies and utilities companies. Different rationales exist for the provision of public subsidies; some are economic, some are political and some come from socio-economic development theory. Development theory suggests that some industries need protection from external competition to maximize domestic benefit. Technically speaking, a free market economy is free of subsidies; introducing one transforms it into a mixed economy. Economists and policy makers often debate the merits of subsidies, and by extension, the degree to which an economy should be a mixed one. Pro-subsidy economists argue that subsidies to particular industries are vital to help support businesses and the jobs they create.  Other economists feel free market forces should determine if a business survives or fails; if it fails, those resources are allocated to a more efficient and profitable use. They argue that subsidies to these businesses simply sustain an inefficient allocation of resources. Subsidies: The Pros Economists who promote a mixed economy often argue that subsidies are justifiable to provide the ""socially optimal"" level of goods and services. In contemporary neoclassical economic models, there are circumstances where the actual supply of a good or service falls below the theoretical equilibrium level – an unwanted shortage, which creates what economists call a ""market failure."" One form of correcting this imbalance is to subsidize the good or service being under supplied. The subsidy lowers the cost for the producers to bring the good or service to market. If the right level of subsidization is provided, all other things being equal, the market failure should be corrected. In other words, according to general equilibrium theory, subsidies are necessary when a market failure causes too little production in a specific area: They would theoretically push production back up to optimal levels. There are many goods or services that allegedly provide what economists call ""positive externalities."" A positive externality is achieved whenever a transaction between two parties provides an indirect benefit to a third party. Many subsidies are implemented to promote positive externalities that might not otherwise be provided at the socially optimal threshold. Some theories of development argue that the governments of less-developed countries should subsidize domestic industries in their infancy to protect them from international competition. This is a popular technique seen in China and various South American nations currently. Subsidies: The Cons Free market economists are wary of subsidies for a variety of reasons. Some argue that subsidies unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses to less productive ones. Similar concerns come from those who suggest economic calculation is too inexact and microeconomic models are too unrealistic to ever correctly calculate the impact of market failure. Others suggest that government spending on subsidies is never as effective as government projections claim they will be. The costs and unintended consequences of applying subsidies are rarely worth it, they claim. Another problem, antagonists say: The act of subsidizing helps corrupt the political process. According to political theories of regulatory capture and rent-seeking, subsidies exist as part of an unholy alliance between big business and the state. Companies often turn to government to shield themselves from competition. In turn, businesses donate to politicians or promise them benefits after their political careers. Even if a subsidy is created with good intentions, without any conspiracy or self-seeking, it raises the profits of those receiving beneficial treatment, and so creates an incentive to lobby for its continuance, even after the need or its usefulness runs out. This potentially allows political and business interests to create a mutual benefit at the expense of taxpayers and/or competitive firms or industries. There are a few different ways to evaluate the success of government subsidies. Most economists consider a subsidy a failure if it fails to improve the overall economy. Policymakers, however, might still consider it a success if it helps achieve a different objective. Most subsidies are long-term failures in the economic sense, but still achieve cultural or political goals. An example of these competing evaluations could be seen in the Great Depression.

88,Christina Wilkie,9142017,CNBC,9072017,"Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled his single-payer health-care proposal, ""Medicare for All,"" on Wednesday, to a packed room of supporters on Capitol Hill. The bill already has 16 Democratic co-sponsors, a number that would have been unimaginable just a year ago. The independent senator from Vermont also released a white paper on how the government might finance such a health-care system, which included an income-based tax increase, an expansion of the estate tax, and a new tax on incomes of the 0.1 percent of Americans. ""Today, we begin the long and difficult struggle to end the international disgrace"" of U.S. health-care costs, Sanders said, emphasizing that Americans pay more in health-care costs than any other developed nation, nearly 18 percent of U.S. GDP. ""The American people want to know what we're going to do to fix a dysfunctional health-care system."" Under a Medicare for All plan, ""depending on your income, your taxes may go up,"" Sander said, ""but this will be more than offset"" by overall household savings on health-care costs, premiums and copays. The senator also stressed that a government-managed plan would simplify the financial affairs of both individuals and small- and medium-sized companies. ""You will no longer be writing checks to private insurance companies,"" he said. ""And today we tell the business community that we understand you want to focus on your core mission, not spending countless hours wondering how you're going to cover your employees' health insurance."" Sanders was joined at the podium by a number of high-profile Democrats said to be eyeing potential presidential campaigns in 2020. Among them were Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. There was also a distinctly campaign-like vibe at the hourlong rollout, with supporters cheering and holding signs. Sanders contributed to the energy, telling the crowd that the launch was the start of a national grass-roots campaign. ""Our job now is to take this legislation to every state in the country and hear what the people have to say."" Theatrics aside, Sanders' bill would create a national health insurance program managed by the federal government and modeled on the current Medicare program. Private insurance would still exist to cover elective medical procedures, but would otherwise be phased out as the Medicare for All program was introduced and expanded over a four-year period. Even before it was launched, Sanders' plan received swift and bitter criticism from Republicans, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whose daily briefing overlapped with the senator's event. Huckabee Sanders called single-payer health-care systems a ""horrible"" idea, and said, ""I can't think of anything worse than having government more involved in your health care."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unveiling his own health-care plan earlier in the day, declared, ""Bernie, this ends your dream of a single-payer health-care system in America."" But polls show that support for single-payer health care is growing in the U.S. According to a  recent poll by Kaiser Health News, 53 percent of adults, and one-third of respondents who identified as Republicans, support a single-payer government health-care system. As long as Republicans control Congress and the White House, Sanders' bill has no chance of becoming law. Nonetheless, it serves as an important benchmark of where the Democratic Party, and Democratic voters, stand going into the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential contest.

89,Jacob Pramuk,9142017,CNBC,9072017,"President Donald Trump weighed in on — but did not explicitly endorse — a last-ditch Obamacare repeal plan unveiled by multiple Republican senators on Wednesday. The president, who had recently appeared to shift his focus to tax reform after the Senate failed to pass various forms of a health-care overhaul this summer, said he applauded the senators ""for continuing to work toward a solution."" ""As I have continued to say, inaction is not an option, and I sincerely hope that Senators Graham and Cassidy have found a way to address the Obamacare crisis,"" Trump said in a statement. Trump's comments about the plan appear less forceful than those he made earlier in the year when he repeatedly urged senators to repeal President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, a top campaign promise. Four GOP senators, led by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, introduced the long-shot plan earlier on Wednesday. It aims to get rid of subsidies and mandates under the Affordable Care Act, and instead give block grants to states to help to make coverage affordable. Republican Senate leaders appear to have little interest in pushing forward with the health-care plan. The GOP faces a Sept. 30 deadline to use budget reconciliation for fiscal year 2017 and will lose its ability to pass a health-care bill with only the 52 Republican senators at that time. Graham cast the plan as the last, best hope to roll back Obamacare. He also described it as the only thing standing between the United States and a single-payer health care, which independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and various Democrats will put their weight behind Wednesday. ",Trump talks Graham Cassidy Obamacare repeal plan,0.9882
90,Qin Chen,9142017,CNBC,9072017,"The United Nations Security Council on Monday unanimously approved new sanctions against North Korea, the harshest yet — capping North Korea's oil imports, banning textile exports, ending additional overseas labor contracts. Bitcoin ""mining"" could become a viable income source for this further-isolated nation that's craving nuclear weapons. ""We weren't able to determine the volumes, like how many bitcoin they can generate per certain time period. We could just see activity,"" said Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future. ""First [hypothesis] is that the activity is sponsored by the state, as a way to generate funds for the regime,"" said Moriuchi. ""The second hypothesis is that it's an individual user, among this small sliver of leaders and their families who have access to the internet."" ""Mining"" is a process of earning bitcoins. Miners use high-performance computers to solve complex mathematical problems and verify bitcoin transactions online. In return they are rewarded with bitcoins. But who would be capable of pulling off such activity in the autocratic country? After all, most North Koreans have no access to the internet. Only a small minority of users — university students, scientists and select government officials — have access to Kwangmyong, a domestic intranet ""that offers email and websites but is totally shut off from the rest of the world,"" according to a  Slate article. ""Only the most senior leaders and ruling elite are granted access to worldwide internet directly,"" Moriuchi wrote in her report. North Korean elites access internet primarily through three IP ranges, one of which is assigned by China Netcom. Bitcoin one-year price chart Bitcoin has more than tripled in value this year to $3,800, and North Korea's neighbor and biggest trading partner, China, is also a major player in the bitcoin world. More than half the newly mined bitcoins come from mining pools in China. Chinese companies such as Bitmain and Canaan also dominate the bitcoin-mining hardware games. Their ASIC miners — computer cards that mine bitcoin 50 times faster than traditional video graphics cards — have become the go-to mining tools for large-scale mining operations. Jonathan Mohan, a blockchain consultant and the founder of Bitcoin NYC meetup, said, ""It wouldn't surprise me if, perhaps, hypothetically, North Korea were to have pre-existing business relationships in China that wouldn't mind purchasing bitcoin from them, and then just disseminating it to the Chinese market as you would with any other bitcoin."" The Chinese general administration of customs did not respond to CNBC requests for comment. In 2014, the U.S. Treasury Department addressed concerns about how digital currencies can be used by countries looking to evade sanctions: ""If a sanctioned entity could use virtual currencies to transact anonymously, our sanctions would have a weaker bite."" A year before that, Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) asked digital currencies exchanges — platforms for buying, selling and storing digital currencies — to register with FinCEN, and ""report suspicious transactions to adequately guard against money laundering and terrorist financing abuse."" Many digital currencies exchanges have since registered, including Coinbase, one of the major exchanges. Coinbase does not operate in North Korea or other sanctioned countries and would not comment to CNBC on any North Korean bitcoin activity. Any North Korean activity in bitcoin is likely a tiny fraction of global trade activity. The total trade volume of bitcoin was nearly $2 billion, according to CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations. Also, Recorded Future's report is based on a limited dataset from April 1 to July 6, provided by its intelligence partner, Team Cymru (a nonprofit Internet security research group). ""It's possible they [North Korea] have been ""mining"" bitcoin for a while, but they stopped for a period of time. ... or maybe they are using infrastructure and computers in other places,"" said Moriuchi. ""We happen to have the view to this one snapshot for this one period of time."" At first, Moriuchi and her team at Recorded Future were looking to develop some type of tools or warnings of North Korea's missile launches. They just happened to stumble across the bitcoin ""mining"" activity. ""One week, when I retrieved the data for the week of May 17, I noticed there was unusual amount of bitcoin activity that I have not seen before ... from nothing to hundreds of data points a day, clearly bitcoin mining. And it was ongoing, through the end of my dataset,"" said Moriuchi. She also flagged the bitcoin ""mining"" as ""suspect activity"" in the report. ""Bitcoin ['mining'] in itself is not criminal by any means; it's not a suspect activity. But the timing of that activity was an interesting correlation with the WannaCry [cyber]attack,"" said Moriuchi. The ""mining"" started five days after the cyberattack, which locked tens of thousands of computer and data files for ransom payments in bitcoin. The attack has also been attributed to North Korea by the U.S. National Security Agency. North Korea is drenched in chronic economic problems, due to a one-sided focus on military spending and decades of economic sanctions from the international community. Under the U.N. sanctions imposed in August, China has banned imports on North Korea's iron, coal and seafood, which accounts for about 35 percent of North Korea's trading income. North Korea may be ""mining"" bitcoin as a way to get around the tighter sanctions. It also helps that bitcoin is an open and decentralized network, making ""mining"" a legal and relatively easy activity for anyone who has access to the internet. Ultimately, it's up to the international community and the bitcoin community to decide whether they're comfortable trading bitcoin with North Korea. ""People are still free to choose who they want to interact with, so if enough people choose to reject bitcoin that are associated with North Korea, then North Korea wouldn't be able to do anything with bitcoin,"" said Nchinda Nchinda, internal operations officer of MIT Bitcoin Club, a cryptocurrencies research organization run by Massachusetts Institute of Technology students.

92,"Linda Ha, special to CNBC.com",9142017,CNBC,9072017,"Raphael Natividad is guilty of something most millennials don't usually do: ignoring his phone. Natividad, who recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine, with a degree in heath policy, has a legitimate reason, one that speaks to an existential crisis that has befallen a growing number recent graduates. ""I was ashamed that I didn't have a full-time job right after college, and that shame made me hesitant to spend time with underclassmen or with peers who I thought had brighter futures,"" Natividad told CNBC in a recent interview. ""I consistently tried to avoid people, and I would ignore messages on my phone or on group chats to avoid any conversation about the future."" Although not an official designation by the American Psychiatric Association, a few therapists are using the term ""post-graduation depression."" According to mental health professionals — and recent graduates feeling its effects — the condition is characterized by a period of severe sadness, loss of motivation, helplessness and isolation due to constant change and an overabundance of choices. From kindergarten through college, school becomes the primary structure giving students a sense of certainty, while providing them with a social network for learning and support. Yet after graduation, that structure crumbles, and with no set timetables or mandatory classes to study for, anxiety, depression and a sense of loss about what to do next become all too common. ""This is a real issue unique to this generation called 'a quarter-life crisis,'"" said Cyrus Williams, a licensed professional counselor and an associate professor at Regent University in Virginia. Millennials are ""struggling in terms of milestones, getting jobs, parenting, finding jobs, having too many choices, and having debt coming right out of college."" Satya Byock, a psychotherapist based in Portland, Oregon, who primarily treats millennials, said it's inevitable that this age group will experience a long period of confusion and uncertainty. She told CNBC that each individual establishes what life looks like for them, but in a way that was never required before. ""College is explicitly about scholarships, academia, left-brain learning, and in large [part] it has nothing to do with life preparation, mental health, physical health, nutrition, or basic life skills,"" said Byock. In her opinion, she added, ""the notion that people wouldn't struggle after college is kind of silly."" Natividad, who graduated in June, is among those grappling with his life choices. He's currently working a part-time job doing research at his alma mater. ""There are so many paths I can follow,"" he said, but added he's ""struggling to decide if I should apply for graduate school this year or next year, or if I should even apply at all."" A big reminder of the need to make decisive life choices is the intractable problem of student debt, currently sitting at all-time highs. According to Federal Reserve data, the average monthly payment for a borrower in their 20s is $351 a month, while the average balance carried by that age group is about $22,135. With only six months to devise a financial plan to pay off this debt, some graduates find themselves pushed to make career decisions based on their financial needs — while the search for a so-called dream job takes a back seat. Decerry Donato, earned a bachelor's degree in literary journalism and was unemployed for five months. Since then, she has worked as a retail sales associate, freelance writer and photographer, and is currently a receptionist at a genetics lab. ""People assume that just because you have a degree, you're set and you're going to get a job right after college,"" said Donato. She said graduates often feel pressured by relatives to secure a job, particularly parents, even if it doesn't help them gain experience in their desired career field. ""I sent 20 applications a day, and was happy to even get a rejection email back from an employer because you could send hundreds of applications and never get a reply back,"" Donato told CNBC. In that context, more than 4 in 5 adults in the U.S. report that they constantly check their email, texts and social media accounts, according to a recent American Psychiatric Association report. That attachment to electronic devices is associated with higher stress levels for millennials, the study found. The APA reports that on average, millennials experience the highest level of stress than any other generation, suggesting a need for more conversation surrounding mental health and the pressures facing recent graduates. The situation also creates room for unhealthy comparisons to other recent graduates, many of whom post seemingly high-achieving photos of their lives on Facebook and Instagram. Recent studies suggest social media feeds feelings of envy and anxiety. ""Having external validation as our only validation is damaging. So I think it's really critical for all individuals, in particular, young adults to have time for introspection and self-love and self-knowledge,"" said Byock. The therapist said everyone posting on social media is 'projecting okayness' which may lead to problems asking others for help. ""But, pretty much everyone else is also struggling,"" she added.

93,"Douglas Quenqua, special to CNBC.com",9142017,CNBC,9072017,"As a social worker with 30 years' experience working in hospice care, Christina Ingenito expected to face death gracefully when her time came. But when a breast cancer diagnosis at 59 left this once ebullient woman ""severely clinically depressed"" — her words — she turned to an unusual research project for help. In 2016, Ingenito became one of 18 subjects in the first-ever FDA-cleared study to explore the therapeutic effects of MDMA — commonly known as ecstasy — on people with life-threatening illnesses who are suffering from depression. After four standard (i.e., sober) therapy sessions with the two psychologists leading the study, Ingenito embarked on three ""medicine journeys,"" as she calls them: marathon eight-hour therapy sessions fueled by capsules of MDMA. ""Incredible"" is how she describes the experience now. ""From the very first moment that I felt the medicine in my body, it radically transformed all the trauma that I had been holding, not only from the diagnosis but previously from my life as well. My anxiety is gone; the depression is gone; my life force is back."" Today she is free from both cancer and depression. Depression now affects 16 million Americans and 350 million adults worldwide, according to the NIMH, making it one of the most common disabilities in the world. But even with more than 20 antidepressants approved by the FDA over the past 60 years, many people still struggle with the condition: One-third of Americans simply don't respond to any of the currently available medicines, studies say, and there hasn't been a significant breakthrough in decades. As the years of desperation mount, doctors are finding themselves turning to new and unexpected sources for the next big antidepression drug. Though there is no shortage of antidepression drugs currently available, analysts believe there is still plenty of opportunity in the nearly $17 billion global market. The notion that a ""party drug"" like MDMA could be used for more than recreation may have been out of fashion for many years, but it's not a new idea. Before it was outlawed in the 1960s, LSD showed promise as a treatment for depression and alcoholism. Dr. Phillip Wolfson, an author of Ingenito's study, was one of several mental health professionals experimenting with MDMA as a therapy aid in the early 1980s before it was outlawed. But a combination of prohibition and social stigma rendered it nearly impossible to get government permission, much less funding, to perform any sort of research with such drugs. Now a handful of studies — and the persistent researchers behind them — are pointing to a future where drugs like LSD, MDMA, ketamine and psilocybin (the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms) could find a second life not just as therapeutic aids but as potential blockbusters.

Insurers, doctors battle over new heart disease drugs ""MDMA has a blockbuster aspect in many, many areas,"" said Dr. Wolfson in a telephone interview. ""It could be used for PTSD, depression, couples' work, relationship work and probably OCD."" The evidence, he claims, is in the studies now being published. Though results of Ingenito's study are still being analyzed, preliminary data suggests the MDMA sessions dramatically alleviated depression in the subjects. That follows an earlier study that tested MDMA as a treatment for PTSD in which 80 percent of subjects no longer suffered from the condition after just two sessions. Early studies with psilocybin have been similarly encouraging. In a 2016 NYU study looking at whether the drug could alleviate anxiety and depression in cancer patients, more than 80 percent of subjects reported significant improvements. A smaller  2012 study yielded similar results. Ketamine — which goes by the street name Special K — has been studied more than most illicit drugs, thanks to its legal status in the United States as a tranquilizer (usually for animals). And results have been so encouraging that both Allergen and Johnson & Johnson currently have ketamine-inspired antidepressants in late-stage clinical trials. Of course, ketamine and MDMA are powerful drugs with serious side effects that would need to be managed. Ketamine's paralyzing effect can be so powerful, it's often classified as a date-rape drug, and users sometimes asphyxiate because they can't clear their own airwaves. MDMA can induce symptoms resembling a panic attack — sweating, nausea, chills, involuntary teeth clenching — and is occasionally associated with heat stroke.  Due to the risks, there is a clinical study under way at Stanford University to test if ketamine acts like an opioid. Promising as the research on some illicit drugs is, scientists caution that many of these treatments are still years away from commercial availability, and the testing itself is, in many cases, still in its infancy. For example, a team of researchers in the U.K. last year became the first ever to produce images of the human brain on LSD — a remarkable fact, considering how widely the drug has been consumed over the past 50 years. But the obstacles to working with the drug were simply too great, said Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College and an author of the study. ""The illegal status of LSD meant that researchers were scared, and the costs of complying with the regulations were prohibitive, and governments wouldn't fund the research because the drugs were illegal."" Still, the results of the scans strongly suggested that LSD could help treat depression in much the way psilocybin does. ""It switches off regions of the brain that are overactive in depression,"" Nutt said. It also disrupts communication between certain sections of the brain, producing an ""ego dissolution"" that helps users feel more connected to the world around them. Such results are going a long way toward easing the path for researchers who want to explore these drugs. As is the existence of groups like MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), which has helped secure private funding for much of the research on these drugs — a notoriously difficult endeavor given the stigma surrounding them. Of course, MAPS is not the first group to advocate for the legal use of psychedelics. And hopes of a breakthrough in the area seem to arise every decade or so, suggesting the path to FDA approval may still be a long, arduous one. But Dr. Wolfson, who has watched the enthusiasm for researching psychedelic drugs rise and fall over the decades, says he's never seen the surge of interest like he is seeing now. ""Interest is peaking,"" said Dr. Wolfson, but ""it hasn't peaked yet.""

94,"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC",9142017,CNBC,9072017,"What happened the last time you were prescribed an opioid? If you're like most people, you didn't finish them — and didn't dispose of them — in effect, making you a potential source of illicit drugs and addiction that has been exploding across America. This rogue supply of painkiller is alarming, given the latest data on addiction deaths: Even after years of heightened attention from politicians and the press to the nationwide opioid epidemic, 2016 saw an increase in overdose deaths of 21 percent, with rates of synthetic-opioid deaths doubling, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There are around 200 million opioid scripts a year. ... It's an extraordinary reserve,"" said Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who worked on drug policy for the Obama administration. ""That's just as many scripts as there are adults; it's such a huge reservoir to tap. ... Lots of people just don't think about it,"" Humphreys said. As many as 92 percent of patients don't finish their painkillers, and less than 10 percent dispose of them properly — either flushing them down the toilet or returning them to a hospital, pharmacy or law enforcement, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Surgery. ""For almost every injury we looked at, patients had pills they didn't use,"" said Johns Hopkins pain-management specialist Mark Bicket, who led the study. ""They become a source for illicit use. Other adults use them, and children and adolescents can find them when they're exploring,"" he said. At least two-thirds of a total of 810 patients didn't use their entire opioid prescription but kept the unused pills, according to the data Johns Hopkins studied, and roughly 75 percent of patients ignore warnings to keep opioids in a locked cabinet. ""If it was only one or two pills, it would be one thing,"" Bicket said. ""But most patients have more than 10 — almost the entire prescription — just lying around."" He said many patients hoard the drugs, not to get high but so they can react to a relapse of pain or some new injury without seeing a doctor again. Many patients stop taking pills because their pain has receded, according to between 42 percent and 71 percent of those studied. A smaller group of patients stopped taking the pills because of side effects. Either way, leaving the pills around the home leads to abuse. ""Some teenage kids want to experiment, but a teenager can also be entrepreneurial,"" Humphreys said. ""You can sell a 20-milligram OxyContin pill for $20 on the street."" He added that other threats are beyond a family's ability to foresee: There have been cases where visitors to a real estate open house clean out pill cabinets. Opioids account for 2 million people with a substance-abuse problem, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Most people with opioid problems began by using pills they were prescribed as pain relievers, but more recent twists in the epidemic include a resurgence of heroin addiction and abuse of fentanyl, the drug that singer Prince overdosed on last year. Drug overdoses in 2016 killed more than 64,000 Americans, with the largest numbers coming from people who abuse prescription pills such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, whose brand-name versions are OxyContin and Vicodin. More recently, the  growth in overdose deaths has come mostly from fentanyl and heroin, the CDC data shows. The simplest thing patients can do to dispose of prescription drugs properly is to simply flush them down the toilet, Bicket said. Patients are right to fear doing environmental damage by flushing — the Drug Enforcement Administration has stated it can affect the water supply — but it's still a better option than leaving unused pills around the house. ""It's a trade-off of risks,"" Humphreys said. ""I think the candid answer a DEA official would give you is that flushing down the toilet isn't good, because it's not good to throw toxic chemicals into the water supply, but flushing, although bad, is less bad than hoarding."" The National Drug Prescription Take Back Day — created by the Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Administration as a way to get unused prescription drugs out of the public supply — is another option and is conducted twice annually. The next Take Back Day will be on Oct. 28 (as of Oct. 1 the Justice/DEA site will list collection locations). There were more than 5,400 collection sites across the country last April and 450 tons of prescription drugs collected. Initially focused on law-enforcement location drop-off, the Obama administration expanded the program in late 2014, giving pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and other ""authorized collectors"" the ability to take back drugs. CVS, among other companies, now offers customers the ability to drop off unused prescriptions. Patients and their family members can also mail their prescription controlled substances to an authorized collector using prepaid mail-back packages that can be obtained at a pharmacy, or from other locations, like libraries and community centers. If drop-off is not an option, the DEA recommends preparing unused drugs for disposal by mixing with coffee grounds or used cat litter, sealing them and then throwing them in the garbage. Humphreys said these efforts work — to a point. ""I remember I was in Russell, Arkansas, for a Take Back day, and in three hours in front of a Wal-Mart, we got more pills than there were people in the town."" But he added that Take Back Days are for all pills — not just controlled substances — and many people bring in vitamins and ""Grandma's liver pills."" He also said the National Take Back Days are designed as ""special occasions"" and, as such, can never be a complete solution. ""We need to force it into a cultural habit so it is not a special event."" Even year-round drop-off at select sites lacks a key component: incentive. Humphreys said the best suggestion he has heard recently about getting unused prescription painkillers off the market is to create a recycling program that includes a financial reward. ""People return bottles because of the deposit."" More from Modern Medicine:A new source of addiction is seducing millions: the Internet Marijuana's role in Alzheimer's research hits federal roadblock The battle over drug pricing hits America's No. 1 killer The Johns Hopkins study doesn't limit culpability to patients. Analyzing data from six previous opioid studies, Bicket found that doctors are failing to keep tabs on where all those pills go. ""Surgeons may not be aware of the magnitude of the problem,"" Bicket said. Doctors and patients are changing how they work with opioids but need to do more. The simplest solution is to not prescribe addictive painkillers: Over-the-counter painkillers, like Tylenol and Advil (acetaminophen and ibuprofen), can be more effective than many patients think, especially when used in tandem, Bicket said. Alternating between the two can enable a patient take more, with a low risk of toxic reaction than if the same patient used more than the recommended dosage of either one. States and the federal government are moving to cut off the flow of unused opiates onto the black market. Massachusetts and Maryland are considering laws to limit the number of pills that can be prescribed at one time, and the federal government last year passed the Reducing Unused Medications Act, which gives doctors or patients the right to direct that a prescription for opioids be dispensed in several separate lots. That way, the patient will return to the pharmacy for more pills only if they are still in pain. ""It is critical to limit the number of pills that travel home from the pharmacy in the first place ... in the absence of greater reforms, encouraging prescribers to embrace the partial fill option for their patients can help to reduce the number of opioids left over in homes across the country,"" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia wrote in a letter to the nation's governors this month, urging them to promote the law in their home states. ""Educating health care professionals about various methods to limit overprescribing, as well as simple policy tools like partial fill and safe disposal of unused medications, are all critical ways to address the opioid epidemic,"" they added. Longer-term strategies could include developing versions of pain drugs that lose their effectiveness after a few months, or adding ways to make the drugs ineffective if they are taken improperly, Bicket said. Neither is ready for the market yet, but ""multiple companies and labs are working on that right now.'' Humphreys said many ideas have been tried over the years, such as putting a shell on a painkiller so if it is crushed for inhalation, the opiate becomes inert; or putting a strong coating on the pill so it makes accessing the opioid difficult. But he said these efforts have limited ability to turn the tide. ""As soon as they [the new drugs] come out, there are internet chat rooms where people say, 'Here is what you do. ... It's an arms race."" There are also boxes that have been designed to only release one opioid every 12 hours, or only dispense when a code is entered or fingerprint-scanned, and these work in some limited situations. ""I'm from West Virginia and you worry about someone breaking into your trailer to steal your painkillers,"" Humphreys said. But as someone who has worked for many years on the opioid epidemic, the Stanford professor isn't hopeful for any single, novel solution. There is only one way to beat addiction: less prescriptions. He said the medical students that he comes into contact with today are ""far more cautious"" about prescribing opioids than their mentors. Even as overdose deaths increased in 2016, the number of prescriptions fell between 2012 and 2015 for the first time in decades. ""If you look at American opioid prescribing, which is off the charts, if you reduced it by 75 percent, we would still be among the list of top nations,"" Humphreys said. He added that there is no known estimate for the rogue opioid supply but thinks the ""off-book"" supply of drugs has to be ""massive."" If the level of prescriptions doesn't keep coming down, ""all this other stuff is at the margins,"" he said.

96,Stacey Yuen,9142017,CNBC,9072017,"North Koreans are likely to face serious food shortages despite recent relief from an intense dry spell, officials from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization told CNBC. Rainfall this year was ""considerably lower"" than a corresponding period in 2001, when cereal production in the communist dictatorship plunged to record lows, the UN said in a July report. An estimated 20 percent of herd animals have also reportedly been severely affected this year in the worst-hit regions. The worst dry conditions, which ran from April to June, could threaten this year's overall agricultural yield and exacerbate food shortages in the country. According to the report, cereals, potato and soybeans comprise the main source of nutrition for North Korea's population — many of whom are already underfed. Even before taking the drought into account, the UN estimates that the average North Korean consumes approximately 1,640 calories of food each day. That compares with the 2,000 calories recommended for Americans by the U.S. Department of Health. Rainfall has improved over large parts of the country since August, but the shift in precipitation will be insufficient to reverse the adverse effects of the drought, said Mario Zappacosta, senior economist at the UN. By the time rain fell, ""the optimal planting period was over … and the early planted crops were already affected by the drought,"" he said. The months of April to June are critical for crop development, according to the UN report. North Korea's overall yields for the 2017 ""main season"" crops — those harvested around September and October — are expected to fall compared with 2016, Zappacosta added. It's not yet possible to determine how much, however. Still, crop output is unlikely to fall to the unprecedentedly low levels in 2000 to 2001, according to Cristina Coslet, country monitor at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization. Coupled with the latest round of UN sanctions, which aim to pressure North Korean leader Kim Jong Un into giving up his nuclear weapons, unfavorable weather conditions are likely to severely hurt Pyongyang's economy. ""They are facing a very bad harvest. And with the latest sanctions, [Kim] won't be able to pay in credit for his oil imports anymore,"" said Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Switzerland-based private bank Julius Baer. Kim would do well to pause his weapons testing in exchange for aid from China or the United States, Matthews added. North Korea is currently harvesting its main-season crops, scheduled to be completed by mid-October. The UN agency will await until then to determine its final production estimates for the country, which will not be ready before end October, Coslet said. The regime still cannot feed its own people without external food aid, who rely on black markets to buy rice, produce, beer and even school supplies. Chinese food exports to North Korea have soared over the past year, despite increasing sanctions imposed by the UN, hinting at Pyongyang's increasing reliance on Beijing.

97,"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC.com",9142017,CNBC,9072017,"Amidst the media hubbub of the new presidential administration, autism was back in the news. Well-known vaccine skeptic Andrew Wakefield attended one of President Donald Trump's inaugural balls; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and outspoken critic of vaccines, claimed that Trump had asked him to chair a commission on ""vaccine safety and scientific integrity,"" though seven months after those initial reports no concrete plans for such a commission have been made public. Both Wakefield and Kennedy have expressed their doubts about the safety of vaccines on the basis that they may be linked to increased incidence of autism. For many researchers working to find the causes of autism, this is frustrating, if well-tread, rhetoric. ""Regarding vaccines, the case has been closed for many years as far as the evidence is concerned,"" says Mayada Elsabbagh, an assistant professor of psychiatry at McGill University. Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, called the discussion about vaccines and autism a ""distraction"" because money spent looking into it isn't being dedicated to more pressing research questions. In the past decade, researchers have come a long way in narrowing down which conditions may make autism more likely to develop. What they learn could lead to more sophisticated treatments for autism at its early stages, or even prevent the disorder from developing in the first place. Autism Spectrum Disorder, or autism for short, is a disorder that can affect how the brain develops. It's characterized by social challenges, difficulties in communication and behavioral issues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms usually appear in children between 12 and 18 months old. And the effects of autism can range from slight social challenges to severe cognitive impairment. ""If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism — everyone looks a little different,"" says Heather Volk, an assistant professor in the department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. About 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism, according to the CDC. Today the Autism Society estimates that 3.5 million Americans are living with an autism spectrum disorder, and the prevalence has been rising over time, increasing by 119.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to the CDC. Though that's likely also driven by greater awareness of the condition and its symptoms, as well as access to services, Elsabbagh says. A 2014 study found that it costs $2.4 million to support a person with autism and an intellectual disability (which appears to affect 40 percent to 60 percent of those with autism) throughout the course of his or her life. Scientists spent decades looking for a specific gene, or a specific part of the brain, that could be causing the symptoms of autism. But that work hasn't turned up any one specific answer. Instead, researchers have had to change their questions. They now suspect that autism, like other complex diseases such as cancer or obesity, comes about by the interaction of many different genes and environmental factors. Researchers estimate that there may be hundreds of genes that could make someone more likely to develop autism, but merely having any one of those genes doesn't determine whether or not the disorder develops, or how severe it is if it does. Through careful epidemiological studies conducted on large populations, a number of scientists, including  Craig Newschaffer at Drexel University and Peter Bearman at Columbia University, have been able to point to some factors that correlate to the risk of autism. Over the years, researchers have determined that childhood or prenatal exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides ; hormone-disrupting phthalates (often found in plastics) and some found in air pollution, have played a role. Mothers who have bacterial or viral infections during pregnancy or those who are obese are also more likely to give birth to babies who are later diagnosed with autism. It's important to note, however, that these are risk factors for autism, not causes — there's a correlation between these factors and autism, but researchers aren't quite sure of the mechanism that might make the disorder more likely to develop. Researchers are getting creative with the kinds of studies they are designing to better assess these and other potential risk factors. One long-running study at the University of California, Davis tracks a huge array of children's genetic and environmental factors in children as young as two years old to compare those that develop autism to those that do not. Other research efforts start even earlier, tracking moms — since autism seems to run in families, scientists are recruiting mothers who already have one child with autism, then recruit the next sibling. ""If you do this during pregnancy, you can give the mom questionnaires in real time and ask her things like where she drove, what she ate,"" Volk says. Plus, you can take samples from the mother during her pregnancy or even image the fetus' brain as it develops. More from Modern Medicine:FDA testing groundbreaking science: Human organs-on-a-chip

A new sickle-cell drug 25 years in the making But even if a well-designed study uncovers a new risk factor, that has to be validated and replicated by other scientists. And so far, Volk says, researchers are not far enough down the road to come up with any interventions to treat or prevent autism based on those findings. There are some findings that, if reflected in policy, are generally beneficial, such as having cleaner air and making baby bottles that are BPA-free. ""But we're not far enough to think about pharmacological interventions in pregnancy,"" Volk says. Right now the most effective interventions for autism take place after a child has begun to show symptoms. ""The best way for us to support children with autism is to support parents so that they interact with children and address concerns with children together,"" Elsabbagh says. Programs are popping up all over the world to help parents do exactly that—to modify their own behavior towards children with autism so that, over time, the children's brains develop in the most optimal way possible. In the US, some of those programs include the UC Davis MIND Institute, the  Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in New York and the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. Researchers are working on how to make these costly programs available to all families who need them, Elsabbagh says. It's not clear what future interventions might look like. But scientists are working on it. ""I think the best thing we can do as scientists is ask smart questions and follow the data where it seems to point,"" Volk says. Sometimes, that process is time consuming or surprisingly complex. ""I think maybe the challenge in that type of reporting is that science changes incrementally. We make small discoveries over time,"" Elsabbagh says. And though they've been at it for decades, researchers are hopeful that they can unravel autism to provide more effective interventions for people with autism. ""I don't think [understanding autism] is an unsolvable problem. I don't think any autism researcher would be doing it if it were,"" says Halladay of the Autism Science Foundation. According to the National Autism Association,  a person with autism may: Not respond to his or her name.Have obsessive interests.Avoid eye contact or physical contact.Have difficulty understanding, or showing understanding, of others' feelings or their own.Repeat words or phrases.React more or less sensitively than usual to sounds, smells, tastes, sights or physical sensations.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you're one of the millions of Americans with Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage coverage, or if you're signing up for one of these plans for the first time, then you're probably wondering: How do I lower my drug costs when Medicare falls short? Here are six tips that can save you a pile of money on your medicine when you're on Medicare. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Every year, Medicare Part D members can switch their plan, and if you find that you're paying more than you want to pay for drugs on your existing plan, it may be time to switch to a plan that provides better coverage. For example, the standard Part D deductible is $400, but some plans provide coverage from dollar No. 1. You may pay a little more per month for the additional coverage, but that's not always the case. Some plans with no deductible cost roughly the same per month as a standard plan. At a minimum, eliminating your deductible can help you avoid the up-front cash crunch caused by paying a deductible before your coverage kicks in. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Once the total retail price of the drugs you buy reaches $3,700, you're typically responsible for 100% of your drug costs up to a cap of $7,425 in 2017. This $3,725 gap in coverage is called the ""donut hole."" Fortunately, some plans offer additional donut hole coverage that can save you money. For example, you may be able to find a plan that allows you to pay the same copay as you would prior to entering the donut hole. This coverage will increase your monthly premium, but it can lower your total spending if you find yourself in the donut hole every year. A word of caution, though: Every plan covers individual drugs differently, and oftentimes, donut hole coverage doesn't include expensive brand-name drugs. Therefore, review the lists of covered drugs carefully and contact the insurer to confirm your medicine is covered. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It can pay off to ask your doctor about generic alternatives to your existing medications, because generic drugs are cheaper than brand-name drugs, and the FDA only approves generic drugs after they've proven to be equivalent to the brand-name drugs you're already taking. Generic drugs offer lower copays, and they're more likely to be included in the donut hole coverage I recommend in tip No. 2. Furthermore, generic drugs' lower retail price can help you delay, or potentially avoid, exceeding the $3,700 annual threshold that puts you in the donut hole in the first place. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Insurers negotiate with drugmakers for the cheapest price, and the cheapest drugs are included in each insurer's preferred drug list. You can save a lot of money by picking a plan whose ""preferred"" drugs include the ones you need -- especially when you use the plan's preferred pharmacy to fill your prescription. For example, CVS Health's SilverScript Plus' California plan offers $0 copays for preferred generic drugs filled by its preferred pharmacy, which, unsurprisingly, is CVS. If you use a nonpreferred pharmacy to fill a preferred drug on this plan, it will cost you $10. Meanwhile, filling a prescription for a preferred brand-name drug at a preferred pharmacy can cost as little as $67.50 -- less than half what it would cost to fill the same prescription at a non-preferred pharmacy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you take the same medicine all year long, filling 90-day prescriptions instead of 30-day prescriptions will also save you money. For example, the copay for a preferred generic drug filled by AARP's MedicareRx Preferred plan in Ramsey County, Minnesota, is $0 for a 90-day supply when it's filled by AARP's preferred mail-order pharmacy, OptumRx. The copay for a 90-day supply of a preferred brand-name drug that's filled by OptumRx is $90, which is a 21% discount to the cost of filling a 30-day supply at a nonpreferred pharmacy. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. If you've taken advantage of these tips and your medicine is still costing too much, then you may still have some ways to cut those expenses even further. Many drug companies offer discount savings programs for patients in the donut hole, and you can see if such a program exists for the medicine you take by going to Medicare's pharmaceutical assistance program website. You may also qualify for a pharmaceutical assistance program through Medicare, Social Security, and/or your state of residence. If you qualify for Medicare and Social Security's program, you could pay no more than $3.30 for each generic drug or $8.25 for each brand-name covered drug in 2017. If you don't qualify, many states also offer programs that may help. For instance, New York's EPIC program can reduce drug costs for couples with annual household income of up to $100,000. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It's important to discuss your financial situation candidly with your doctor, because they may recommend changes to your treatment plan that can reduce your out-of-pocket costs. They know how expensive drugs have become, and they're in the best position to help you figure out your options. Overall, even if you're in good health, don't skimp on your coverage. It's better to over-prepare financially by buying the best coverage you can afford than to get caught flat-footed when an unexpected illness or injury strikes. ","

According to Department of Health and Human Services officials, the Trump administration is slashing outreach and navigator funding for the upcoming enrollment cycle, which begins on Nov. 1, 2017 and ends on Dec. 15, 2017, for the 2018 calendar year. Outreach funding, which involves marketing and advertising to make consumers aware of their enrollment options, is being cut by 90% to just $10 million, while navigator funding (navigators answer questions for consumers and guide them in their search for an ACA plan) will be cut by 41%. The administration justified the latter cut by pointing out that navigators hadn't been hitting their enrollment objectives. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to less funding being available for marketing for the upcoming enrollment cycle, premiums are also expected to soar. President Trump has made it crystal clear that repealing and replacing Obamacare is a prime goal while he is in the Oval Office. The uncertainty created by Trump's and the GOP's efforts to repeal, coupled with ongoing losses for a number of national insurers, has precipitated a huge spike in rate requests by health-benefit providers. While there is no clear consensus as of yet regarding how much rates could rise nationally in 2018 since many states are still negotiating with insurers, ACASignUps.net estimates that premiums could jump 15.44% across the 47 states it has data on thus far. This scenario assumes that the Trump administration keeps cost-sharing reductions (which help lower the cost of copays, coinsurance, and deductibles) in place. Should these be removed, coupled with no enforcement of the Shared Responsibility Payment (the penalty consumers are supposed to pay for not buying health insurance), premiums could rise by an average of 29.49% across 47 states. It's not a very pleasant forecast, but there are (thankfully) ways for consumers to potentially save money in the upcoming year. Here are 10 Obamacare tips that could help put extra money in your pocket when shopping for health coverage. Image source: Getty Images. The first move you'll want to consider making is applying for the Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) if you're earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. APTCs are the subsidy attached to the ACA that lowers your out-of-pocket premium costs. The APTC is an especially helpful tool for seniors aged 50 to 64 and lower-income individuals and families that makes their premiums affordable. In 2018, the federal poverty level for a household of one will be $12,060, meaning folks with earned income of $12,060 to $48,240 may qualify for the APTC. Based on the federal poverty levels for 2018 coverage, those earning between $12,060 and $30,150 may qualify. Image source: Getty Images. While it's true that we've witnessed an insurer exodus from the ACA for the upcoming year, consumers still need to take the time to shop around if they hope to get the best deal. Insurers frequently change their premiums and coverage options from one year to the next, meaning the best value one year (note that value may not mean the lowest-cost plan) may not be your best choice the following year. As noted above, the 2018 enrollment period will be made all the more challenging with Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM) announcing their complete exit from the ACA exchanges in the upcoming year, and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) slashing their coverage by more than 90% this year from 2016. Even Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), the company behind the Blue Cross Blue Shield name in 14 states, has announced that it'll be pulling out of a handful of states. If you won't be subsidized by CSRs or the APTC in 2018, it still pays for you to shop around the ACA networks to see if there's an insurance plan that meets your medical and financial needs. However, don't be shy about looking off-network for deals. Private networks like eHealth may offer unsubsidized consumers considerably more options than the ACA exchanges do -- and these private markets are presumably far more stable than Obamacare. Image source: Getty Images. Consumers should also understand that they have a number of exemptions at their disposal that may not only keep them from paying the Shared Responsibility Payment, but could also open up new coverage options. For example, some folks may still qualify for catastrophic insurance coverage, which involves very low premiums but really high deductibles, if they meet certain criteria. For instance, if you're under 30 years old, or you're over the age of 30 and qualify for a hardship exemption, you may be able to purchase a catastrophic plan which, at least from a premium perspective, could be friendlier on your wallet. Arguably one of the greatest aspects of Obamacare is that it allows children to stay on their parents' health plan until they turn 26, which is great for college-aged students who may be too busy focusing on their studies to worry about paying for health insurance. If you're under the age of 26, consider putting hubris aside and latching onto your parents' health plan. Best of all, if you do land a great job with paid coverage from an employer, you can always opt out of your parents' plan. Image source: Getty Images. Another smart decision to consider is purchasing a pricier gold- or platinum-tier plan if you visit the doctor often or have a chronic illness. Though bronze and silver plans may be tempting for their lower premiums, the deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with these plans are considerably higher than under a gold or platinum plan. Even with higher premiums, sicker individuals who head to the doctor more often should be able to save money -- and have fewer out-of-pocket surprises -- by choosing a pricier ACA plan. We Americans typically don't like to be told what to do, but if you want to save some money in the upcoming year on your health insurance, you'll choose to put the tobacco products down. Under ACA guidelines, only five factors determine what you're charged for health insurance: If you use tobacco, insurers have the right to charge up to 50% more for your monthly premiums. This is because scientific studies have shown that smoking leads to an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, and a host of other ailments. Image source: Getty Images. You should also take into consideration, as pointed out above, that where you live can influence what you'll pay each month for health insurance. States like Wyoming and Alaska have frequently offered the highest monthly premiums in the country because of their minimal population and lack of specialized equipment throughout their sparsely placed hospitals and medical centers. States and counties that have dense populations are often some of the cheapest places to buy health insurance since the likelihood of having specialized equipment nearby is high. Finally, consider opening or contributing to a health savings account (HSA). In order to qualify for an HSA, you'll need to be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, not be enrolled in Medicare, and be able to say you're not being claimed as a dependent by anyone else. If you meet these criteria, you'll be able to contribute pre-tax dollars to an HSA, which you can then lean on to help cover the costs of eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on a tax-free and penalty-free basis. Since HSA dollars are pre-tax, it also means contributions can lower your current-year tax liability. If you come into the open enrollment period prepared, there's no reason you can't save yourself money on health coverage in the coming year. ","
      
    10 Obamacare Tips to Save You Money in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

101,Sean Williams,9142017,Fool,9072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chances are you'd struggle to find an industry that's been stronger over the trailing one-year period than legal marijuana. Cannabis research firm ArcView pegged North American legal weed growth at 34% in 2016 and foresees a compound annual growth rate of 26% over the coming five-year period.  Not surprisingly, marijuana stocks have jumped, as an aggregate, by an average of more than 100% over the trailing year, if we only consider the 14 with a current market cap above $200 million. Aside from the massive sales growth behind pot stocks, changing public perceptions have played a key role. No longer perceived to be on the same level as heroin, LSD, and other Schedule I substances, some 60% of respondents want to see marijuana legalized across the U.S., according to Gallup's October 2016 poll. This represents an all-time record high, and it suggests that pressure could be mounting on Congress to make changes in their scheduling of cannabis at the federal level. Image source: Getty Images. However, rapid sales growth and changing perceptions have also attracted a sea of speculators who've thrown around a number of bad reasons to buy into the budding weed industry. If any of the following five reasons summarize why you've purchased a marijuana stock, or a group of stocks, it may be time to re-evaluate your holdings. The thesis here is pretty simple: The percentage of folks who want to see marijuana legalized in some form is skyrocketing, meaning Congress and state governments will have no choice but to listen to the will of the people and legalize cannabis, or risk being voted out of office. In addition to the 60% of Gallup respondents who want to legalize recreational weed, 94% in a Quinnipiac University poll want medical cannabis to be legal nationally. Sounds like a valid thesis, right? There's just one big problem: Congress doesn't have to do anything. Not to deny the fact that Americans have dramatically shifted their views on pot over the past two decades, but it seems highly unlikely that a single issue like marijuana is going to be the reason incumbents are voted out of office if they don't alter their stance on weed. At the moment, Congress is far too concerned with healthcare and tax reform, the debt ceiling, and the upcoming budget to even remotely consider federal marijuana legislation. Image source: Getty Images. Another common investment thesis in marijuana stocks is that expansion via state approvals should lead to growth. Right now, 29 states have legalized medical cannabis, leaving just 21 that haven't, and eight states have legalized the sale of adult-use weed to those aged 21 and over. With more than half of all U.S. states having legalized, marijuana stocks have to be a great investment, right? Not exactly. Quite a few of the remaining 21 states that haven't legalized medical cannabis are run by Republicans, who are among the two groups, along with senior citizens, who still oppose the expansion of marijuana. Also, 24 U.S. states lack the initiative and referendum process, meaning legislation at the state level is essentially the only way to pass medical and recreational pot laws, leaving residents with very little say in the matter. Earlier this year, Vermont's state legislature passed a bill to legalize recreational cannabis and become the ninth state to do so, but Gov. Phil Scott (R-Vt.) vetoed the measure. Long story short, expansion opportunities appear to be dwindling, not increasing, in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Some speculators turn to the eye-popping growth rates behind legal weed as a reason to invest. As noted, ArcView sees legal marijuana sales in North America growing by 26% annually through 2021, reaching nearly $22 billion by that time. With some of the fastest growth estimates around, marijuana stocks have to succeed, right? Wrong. One of the biggest issues with the marijuana industry being so new is that we haven't seen much in the way of industry consolidation. It means that smaller mom and pop-type dispensaries and even grow farms are competing against one another. Without industry consolidation, it makes it incredibly difficult for the retail investor to profit from the growth of legal weed. What's more, marijuana's Schedule I categorization leads to a host of disadvantages for businesses that include an inability to take normal corporate income-tax deductions, as well as difficulty in securing basic banking services, even for something as simple as a checking account. Researchers also struggle to get the green light to run critical clinical studies into the benefits and risks of medical cannabis. Image source: Getty Images. Another clear argument in favor of investing in marijuana stocks -- especially those that are developing cannabinoids to fight disease, or are utilizing the body's natural cannabinoid receptor system -- is the idea that marijuana is medicine. With 29 states having legalized cannabis for medicinal purposes, investors see its benefits outweighing its risks and therefore generating a lot of money for pot stocks. Solid thesis, right? On one hand, we have the example of GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH), which dazzled in multiple phase 3 trials with oral cannabidiol drug Epidiolex as a treatment for two rare types of childhood-onset epilepsy. In all instances, Epidiolex led to a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency, setting the drug up for what could be a 2018 approval from the Food and Drug Administration. However, there's been no shortage of cannabinoid-based failures, either. GW Pharmaceuticals' Sativex failed miserably as a treatment for cancer pain in U.S. phase 3 trials, while Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) recently disappointed in two studies involving its cannabidiol-based gel, ZYN002. Zynerba's lead drug failed to produce a statistically significant reduction in focal seizures for epileptic patients in the Star 1 study, while the Stop trial for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee also missed its primary endpoint. At least the Stop study hit a few secondary endpoints, offering some glimmers of hope. Long story short, cannabis may be medicine, but it's not a miracle cure by any means based on this clinical data. Image source: Getty Images. Lastly, some folks might be buying into marijuana stocks simply for the sake of sticking with what they known. In other words, marijuana users, be it medical or recreational, are buying into marijuana stocks because they're familiar with the product, much in the same way you could buy Coca-Cola stock because you drink Coke. Buying what you know is a great investment thesis, right? Generally speaking, yes it is, as long as the product has staying power. But there's no guarantee that the weed industry has any staying power, for two key reasons. To begin with, in case you forgot, cannabis is still wholly illegal at the federal level. ""Buy what you know"" doesn't work very well when the federal government outlaws what you're investing in. The other issue here is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who'll seemingly stop at nothing to ensure that marijuana's scheduling at the federal level isn't changed. In short, pot is likely to remain a Schedule I drug throughout the Trump presidency, severely hampering the ""buy what you know"" thesis. For marijuana stocks to be investment-worthy, we're going to need to see clear changes at the federal level and industrywide consolidation. For the time being, the safest place continues to be on the sidelines. ","
      
    The 5 Worst Reasons to Buy Marijuana Stocks -- The Motley Fool

102,Todd Campbell,9142017,Fool,9072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Following Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) decision to buy Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) for $11.9 billion in cash, we couldn't help but wonder what other healthcare stocks could be takeover targets, too. A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: Buyouts, buyouts, buyouts! Harjes: Yeah, I can see why. Last week, you were talking to my colleague Michael Douglass on this show about Gilead Science's acquisition of Kite Pharmaceuticals. So, this week, we figured we would continue the trend a little bit by highlighting some stock we think might be the next takeover candidates. After that, we'll discuss the demise of Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), a stock that shed half its value just last month. But first, Todd, I feel like the biotech space is particularly talked about in terms of buyout speculation. Why do you think that is? Campbell: People like to hit home runs in this industry. [laughs] You know? By the nature of the beast, with clinical trials failing and successes being rare, and failures being more frequent, when people go in and buy biotech stocks, they tend to be more risk tolerant. Wouldn't you agree, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, sure. And, investors should be pretty risk tolerant if they're going to enter particularly clinical-stage biotech space. I don't know, it confuses me why there's so much speculation and hope for buyouts, because if it were me and I was buying one of these companies that had what I thought could be a blockbuster drug, I wouldn't want it to get bought out. I would want all that upside of them potentially bringing it to market and actually succeeding. But maybe that's a long-term, short-term difference. Campbell: Yeah, but Kristine, it's not like consumer goods, where you're dealing with a brand like Coca-Cola. All of biotech is driven by patent expiration or protection. With innovation moving so quickly, you may have a great, innovative product, but how long will that innovation keep you ahead of the competition that's coming up the pipeline behind you? From a corporate standpoint, [I think there are] some reasons why you've got entrepreneurs who are saying, ""Let's ring the register and be willing to sell,"" and from the acquirer standpoint, you've got people saying, ""OK, we've got patents expire in, what's the next big thing and can we bring it into our fold to offset that risk?"" Harjes: Yeah, you're right, I can totally see why both sides of the equation would be interested in it. I guess my hesitation is, why do investors push for it so much? I think it's more just the fun of speculating, and that's exactly what we're about to do, is speculate a little bit on who we think could be the next big buyout. One place where there's been a ton of hype around potential acquisitions is none other than the CAR-T space. As a refresher, Kite Pharma, as I mentioned earlier, was bought by Gilead Sciences, it's a CAR-T cancer drug developer. On Kite's acquisition, a bunch of the other CAR-T developers also had their share prices pop, which to me is very indicative that people think that some of these other smaller players might also get acquired. Campbell: Yeah, that move up in Juno was pretty insane, wasn't it, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, I was pretty happy to see it. A long time ago, I realize I probably should have had my money in Kite instead of Juno, but I'm still sitting on my Juno shares. I was definitely a happy camper that day. Campbell: Yeah, I think we got, what, a 40% move up in the span of a couple of days? Obviously, investors were extrapolating, ""If Novartis gets their CAR-T approved, and Kite theoretically gets its approved in November, and Gilead just spent all this money acquiring Kite to be able to get that upside, and then Juno, Juno has these CAR-T drugs, too, and maybe those drugs will be even better. So, perhaps I should get involved with that!"" Harjes: Yeah. I think there are a couple of different ways people might be looking at this. The first is, Gilead might not be finished buying CAR-T developers. I think there are some people out there who look at Gilead's strategy here and say, ""They're not done, they don't want just Kite. They want to build an entire oncology franchise built around cellular therapy,"" which is exactly what you heard John Milligan say on the conference call regarding the Kite acquisition, that they're looking to do this, to see other companies they could fold in and augment what they've already built by buying Kite. So, this is that string of pearls acquisition technique where, instead of making one enormous splashy purchase, you can tuck in a couple of companies here and there, and they definitely have the money to do that. And, on the other side of that coin, you could also have speculation that someone else is going to buy Juno. I'm not sure who exactly that would be, but it could be Celgene. Campbell: I'll throw a name in the mix there, Kristine. Harjes: Who are you going to throw? Campbell: I'll say Celgene. Harjes: Yep. [laughs] Campbell: Why not? Harjes: They've already been looking at Juno in terms of partnerships. Campbell: Oh, absolutely! Correct me if I'm wrong, but they took a stake in it previously when it inked its deal on CAR-T development. I think Celgene has shown that it loves to tie itself to the wagon of emerging biotechnology. They don't have an internal CAR-T option. They do have some collaborations, one with bluebird bio, which was another stock that rallied significantly following the news on Kite. We've discussed that one on the show previously. So, they've got a couple deals externally for CAR-T, but they don't have anything internally. And since they've already shown that they want to be a major player in cancer, you could see that as being a possibility. But, I always get so nervous when we start talking about ifs and buts and whens and what ifs. Harjes: Yeah, you sound like you're about to throw out some caveats. Campbell: Well, yeah. If you look at what's been happening with CAR-T, Juno, I'm not going to call it and also-ran, but they went from being a front-runner to now being in, we'll call it third place. Their JCAR015, they had to shutter development of that. That was their lead product candidate, and they had to shutter development when safety risks caught up to them. Specifically, people were dying because of brain swelling. They had some patient deaths because of brain swelling. Well, they've now shifted their focus to JCAR017, which is a very intriguing drug. It's next generation CAR-T, and they think it could be safer. But, it's not like they've necessarily proven that out. They're not at the same stage as, say, Kite was, with a pending FDA application, or that Novartis was with their CAR-T in getting unanimous support from an adcom committee. So, I think there's a significant amount of risk with all the remaining CAR-T players, and that does make me a little bit cautious on the idea of them being a buyout. Harjes: Yeah. And they're, appropriately, a lot smaller than Kite. At their inflated market cap, Juno and bluebird are both around less than half the size currently. And that, of course, reflects the fact that they are earlier stage. Even bluebird is super early, but they also have this entire side gene therapy program. One more name that I want to mention, because Todd, you brought up the safety risks involved here with CAR-T, and this company that I think has a really a novel way of addressing the safety risks is so, so tiny. They're only $350 million in market cap, which, for Gilead to purchase them, that would be pennies to them. This company is called Bellacom. They have an interesting molecular switching technology that could potentially make it best-in-class down the road, but way down the road. It'll be years. Their lead candidate could maybe hit the market in 2019. So, super interesting technology that could potentially improve the outcomes of some of these CAR-T therapies, things like stem cell transplants, which often have complications. But, this, again, is an extremely early stage company. I'm not even sure if Gilead would be interested in them, because it's so tiny that it probably won't even be a needle mover. Campbell: Yeah. A company like Gilead, they like to focus on companies that are a little bit further along in their development, a little bit closer to market, where they can see a return on their investment in a relatively short period of time. They tied their wagon to Kite right now. I think, unless one of these other companies comes out there and shows that they really have dropped-dead better efficacy, better safety. Safety is going to be key in CAR-T, Kristine. I think that's the differentiator. Harjes: Well, that's a bunch of the Juno theory right now, that they're not going to be first but they might be safest. Campbell: Exactly! And if they are the safest, that's critical, because right now CAR-Ts are getting approved for use in refractory disease, heavily pretreated patients, these patients don't have a lot of treatment options. If they want to be able to tap into the much larger pool of cancer patients and move that up into earlier forms of treatment, they need to be able to prove that these drugs are safe. Now, in clinical trials, I think Juno has shown some really interesting interim results that suggest, possibly, it may have a better safety profile than, say, Kite's Axi-Cel. But, you need to roll this out in more patients, you need to evaluate this because we interim stuff that we saw in JCAR015 looked good, too, right? Harjes: Yeah. You definitely need a bigger sample size. Campbell: Oh, yeah, absolutely! Whenever it comes to investing in clinical-stage companies, I really do caution investors chasing the news and trying to buy something simply because it's running up because of something that's happened to another company. It's a risky way of investing. I think you're better off saying, do I like the technology, after doing the research? Reading everything there is on The Fool about Juno, am I convinced that this company has a better mouse track? If you think that's the case, then be a little patient, wait for shares to balance out a little bit. They've had a big run up. And then pick your spots. Again, keep it to a small, diversified position in your portfolio. Harjes: Yep. Let's pivot pretty hard here away from CAR-T and go over to the robotic surgery market, where Todd, you brought up to me another company that you think might be a very good buyout candidate. Campbell: Kristine, we spent a lot of time talking on the show about companies in biopharma. We don't really talk as much about companies in med-tech. And I thought it might be interesting to go out and try to find a company in med-tech that fits three criteria. I wanted to find something that's a little bit off the beaten path, something that's disrupting an industry. I also wanted to find something that already has a product on the market that's delivering sales growth, and I wanted to find a company that was already being shown some interest or some love by a larger company that could potentially become and acquirer. And when I put all that stuff up in the mixing bowl, the name that popped out for me was Mazor Robotics, a robotics company that's reenvisioning the way surgeons do spinal surgery. Harjes: At first, when I looked at this company, I was like, ""Oh, well, Intuitive Surgical, they're just going to dominate this space, why would I ever be interested in a smaller player?"" But, it turns out that there's actually two pretty separate markets. Mazor has the Mazor X and the Renaissance System that helps surgeons perform spine and brain procedures, which is pretty different from what Intuitive Surgical -- which, if listeners aren't familiar with them, they are the Goliath in robotic surgery. But, Intuitive focuses on gynecological, urology, and general surgery. Campbell: Right, more laparoscopic stuff. Harjes: Right. So, what Mazor is improving the accuracy of surgeons when they're doing these surgeries, it reduces complications, it minimizes the need for inner operative X-rays, which is great because that will lower the radiation doses that patients are exposed to, and it leads to a faster recovery and less postoperative pain. All good stuff there. Campbell: Which is very important. You have to remember that these procedures are being reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid at fixed rates. So, the more that hospital can reduce, say, recovery times, get patients in, get patients out, avoid complications that may end up having them return to the hospital where they're not likely to get reimbursed as much from Medicare and Medicaid, the better. I equate this company, Mazor, to where Intuitive Surgical was maybe five years ago, in the stage of, OK, we're at the tipping point where we've invested a lot of time, effort, and energy over the course of the last few years, and trying to establish ourselves with those first-mover surgeons, the ones who are saying, ""yes, I want to be on the cutting edge of technology."" And now we're getting to a point where there's enough clinical data and papers published and things going on that it's becoming a little bit more mainstream. You're reaching that tipping point where more hospitals may go out and start buying these machines, which are relatively expensive machines. They can run $800,000 to $1,000,000. So, it's a big investment for these hospitals and surgery centers. I think that's what we're seeing now. We're seeing Mazor generate pretty rapid growth for its latest system, which is the Mazor X. Harjes: Which is a win-win, because the more hospitals and surgery centers that you can get into, you not only have the sales from the systems themselves, you also get roughly $1,500 per procedure in disposables sales. That's that razors and blades model that we talked about with Intuitive Surgical. Plus, you also get the service contracts. So, at this point, Mazor just wants to sell the most of these machines that they can to continue getting in that constant revenue from the procedure sales and from the service contracts. So, what they've done is, they've enlisted a little bit of help. Campbell: Yes. And this brings us to the big company that's showing it some love part of the segment, where we step back and say, what's the spine market look like? And, if this company is disrupting the spine market, what players in spine right now are paying attention? And the company that is really paying attention is Medtronic. Medtronic cut a deal with Mazor last year to start using its sales force to generate out leads that would get surgeons at the hospitals that it calls upon to go check out Mazor's system. Harjes: Yeah. This is a partnership that had initially the responsibility for the two of these two companies to both be marketing these machines through the end of this year. Then, it had some options that came at the end of the year. But, we actually just found out earlier this week, I believe it was, that Phase II of the agreement is already going to kick in, which means that Medtronic will take over the exclusive rights to distribute the Mazor X system, and it'll also make another investment in the company. Campbell: Right. It was kind of like a courtship. You went out on a date to see if the two of you liked each other. You had Medtronic giving some very preliminary training on Mazor's system, learning a little bit about it, and then of course, starting to talk about it with the people they were calling upon and get those people to go. The way that the deal had structure originally was, if the Phase I portion of the deal had gone well, then you would advance to Phase II, where Medtronic takes over 100% of all the marketing of it. But that wasn't expected to happen until February of 2018. Instead, they're doing it now. So, that tends to show you a little bit of the opportunity that Medtronic thinks there is for the Mazor X, and how it thinks it may dovetail into its own spine platform, which includes things like, say, the implants that are being used by this system during these surgical procedures, and some of the other componentry that's used by this system during these procedures. You have Medtronic doing $649 million in quarterly sales tied to spine alone. And you have Mazor possibly on the cusp of contributing much more meaningfully to that number over time, now that Medtronic is taking over the responsibility of marketing them. Which, by the way, is global marketing, which is huge, because up toward now, Mazor has really only penetrated the U.S. market. It's not very well penetrated outside the U.S. Harjes: Yeah. I haven't even seen ex-U.S. numbers as projections from Mazor, but within the U.S. alone, the opportunity is still huge. Last year, they only used the system in 5,000 different procedures in the U.S., but they estimate that the total addressable market in just the U.S. is 500,000. So, stretch that out to the global opportunity, and yeah, absolutely, this opportunity is enormous. Campbell: Yeah, I don't know if this is going to get to the size of an Intuitive Surgical. I think there's a likelihood that at some point, Medtronic maybe just swoops in and buys up the company lock stock and barrel. It's already, Kristine, as part of these deals, putting its money where its mouth is and buying shares in Mazor. Harjes: Yep. The equity stake is also huge, just as a vote of confidence from Medtronic, which is a Goliath in the space. Campbell: Right. There are three tranches that Medtronic took advantage of. They bought some shares at $11.42, which has worked out really well for them. They bought another 4% at $21.84. Now, they have a third tranche that they're buying at $38.46. Once they're all said and done, they're going to already own about 12% of Mazor, with a potential to take that up to between 14 and 15% because of some warrants. Harjes: We'll be watching to see if that ever hits 100%. Onto the second segment of today's show where we answer the question, what the heck happened with Teva last month? Campbell: I feel like we've seen this movie before, Kristine. Harjes: With Teva? Campbell: Yeah. A company goes out, spends a lot of money on acquisitions, gets heavily indebted, sales start to fall, next thing you know ... Harjes: Yeah, here we are. Teva has a lot going on right now, but we will unpack all of that. As a reminder, back in August 2016, Teva bough Actavis, which is Allergan's generic business. This was largely funded by debt. Now, fast forward a little bit to today, and that's gotten them in some trouble. Campbell: Yeah, a little bit. The timing of it ... it looked like a really good deal at the time. It was a $40 billion deal, with some of it being done in Teva stock, and the rest of it being done in ""cash."" They borrow the money because, ""Why not, the interest rates are low, I can go out and buy this money and finance it with the sales growth and the cash flow."" That thinking is wonderful as long as you don't stumble and cash flow doesn't start to decline. Harjes: Yeah. When Teva reported earnings on August 23rd, its stock dropped 24% right away, which was due to a confluence of negative news in the earnings report. The most relevant one to this generics business was them saying that because of customer consolidation and increased competition from other generic drug makers, they're just not getting the prices that they're used to. Apparently, the negotiations that they went through on their contract renewals led to a 6% overall price decrease. They expect that to continue eroding through the rest of the year. So, that's alarming on its own, but I'm also really worried by the fact that management didn't really seem to see this coming. Campbell: No. I don't think a lot of the industry did, to be fair. I think some of the pharmacies themselves have been surprised by the impact of falling generic pricing. I think you've seen it throughout the entire supply chain. The reality is this is the situation we're in today on September 6th. We have a company that's a mammoth, it's a Goliath in generic drugs, that now has this rope around its neck in the form of this big debt payment that it has to make. That's going to force it to make some pretty drastic decisions. They've decided to cut their dividend substantially. Harjes: 75%, yeah. Campbell: Yeah, which is something that income investors never want to hear. You can almost hear the shares being flushed out of income portfolios on that news. And they have all sorts of other problems right now with the share price, because Allergan, as part of that deal, got a whole bunch of shares in Teva. They don't want those shares, so they're planning on unloading them in the open market, selling them. So, you have that weight on the share price as well. So, you have a pitch situation where you have generic drug price compression hurting margins and crimping cash flow, interest expense rising because of all of this debt, and a lot of shares becoming available for sale that's affecting the supply and demand for the pricing of the individual shares. Throw on top of all that, Kristine -- Harjes: Yeah, we're not done yet. If you had asked me a year ago, ""What is Teva's largest problem?"", I would have said the fact that Copaxone, which is a huge part of their branded business -- we talked about Teva as a generics business, but it actually does have a branded segment as well that is dominated by this one multiple sclerosis drug, it's the most popular MS drug in the world, and it's going to come off-patent as early as next year. It could be facing unbranded competition, dragging down its profits from this drug. So, we've had our eye on that forever. And all of the sudden, that problem is just one of many. Campbell: Right, they went from 20mg to 40mg so they could improve the dosing schedule, that protected market share for a couple of years. Now, there's been ongoing patent disputes between them and some generics that have some people thinking that you could end up with a 40mg competitor in relatively short order. This is a billion dollar a quarter drug. At one point, it was racking up $4 billion in sales. And in the second quarter, sales were down I think 12% in the United States to $843 million. This is a significant potential headwind at a time where the company doesn't need any more significant potential headwinds. Harjes: Yeah. I'll also know that they are still looking for a permanent CEO. The guy that they have right now is not anything other than an interim president and CEO after the old CEO stepped down last February. Todd, to wrap up this segment, when you're looking at this company, it has gotten really cheap if you look at it on an earnings multiple basis. Do you think it could be a value player right now? Campbell: A value player or a falling knife, take your pick. I don't know. Whenever you look at these metrics, they're either trailing 12 month metrics, which really don't reflect the situation that Teva's moving into, or they're based on forward estimates, which could very well not pan out depending on how this business ends up performing over the next few quarters. It's very hard to say it's cheap at 3X earnings per share if those are earnings per share could end up getting revised 50% lower. So we just simply don't know. You're right, it's trading at a price to book value that's less than one. It's trading at a low single-digit P/E ratio. But, the current ratio is also less than one, which means it doesn't have a whole heck of a lot of wiggle room in the short-term when it comes to financing its short-term or paying its short-term obligations. Do I think that Teva Pharmaceuticals is going to disappear? I guess, push come to shove, no. Am I willing to bet more than 1% of my portfolio on it? [laughs] I think that's the way you have to look at it. You have to say, ""Maybe this is cheap, and I think it's going to come out on the other side. And certainly, there are big demographic trends at support generic prescription volume over time. Maybe I'll put 1% of my portfolio in it, and if it ends up tripling or quadrupling from these levels over a course of five or 10 years, yay, I'm rewarded."" Harjes: Yeah. You also have that dividend yield that, at this point, is looking kind of insane. I want to say it somewhere around 7%. But, I agree with the hesitation in your voice that says this one is likely to be a falling knife. Campbell: Yeah. Kristine, that dividend yield, though, is based on the trailing, not the forward, I don't think. And now that they've cut the dividend, I don't think it's yielding nearly as much. I don't think it's nearly as attractive on that. Over time, you could get into a situation where cash flow stabilizes, they have a plan to restructure by selling some units, raising some cash. If they can do those kind of things, and cash flow grows again, maybe the dividend starts increasing, and that will be one of the key drivers that makes the stock go much higher. But, it's a very high risk-reward stock in my opinion. Harjes: Absolutely. That'll do it for today's show.

103,John Mauldin,9142017,MarketWatch,9072017,"Published: Sept 12, 2017 10:45 a.m. ET Be prepared for the imposition of a value-added tax By There is a big debate over the exact amount of global debt. Parts of it get hidden in many out-of-the-way pockets. But, broadly speaking, global debt is about 325% of gross domestic product (GDP), and likely over $225 trillion as I write this. Global debt is growing faster than global GDP This chart from McKinsey & Co. is almost three years old, but it shows the growth of debt over time, and we know that global debt has ballooned by about $26 trillion in the past two years. The above chart requires a few observations. First, notice that the growth of household and financial debt has decelerated. Corporate debt continues to grow at roughly the same pace as before. The real acceleration of growth in debt is coming from government borrowing. Second, we are on pace to grow the debt by significantly more between 2014 and 2021 than we did in the previous seven years. Last, global debt is growing faster than global GDP. We are borrowing money faster than we are creating wealth. Lies about the U.S. deficit U.S. government debt is about 100% of GDP, or $20 trillion, and growing around $1 trillion a year. Forget what they say when they talk about budget deficits. They lie, because they don’t want to admit what the true deficit is. Read: The U.S. is now over $20 trillion in debt — here’s how it got there However, you can determine the true deficit simply by looking at the amount of money the Treasury has borrowed at the end of the year and see that another $400 billion-$500 billion of “off-budget” debt has been added. If I ran my regulated investment businesses with the same sort of spurious accounting, the Securities and Exchange Commission and a raft of other agencies would shut me down faster than you can say “MD&A” and ban me forever from participating in the financial industry. As they should. You simply cannot lie when you have the public’s trust at stake. Well, you can’t unless you are Congress and the government. Then you can pass laws that allow you to lie. But I digress. To be able to compare our debt to that of other countries, we have to include state and local debt, which is another $3 trillion. That means total U.S. government debt is 115% of GDP. Japan now serves as the U.S.’s crystal ball That is certainly less than the 250% of debt-to-GDP that Japan finds itself saddled with. But Japan does offer us a clue as to how this will play out. If you had told me 10 years ago that Japan could essentially monetize well over 100% of its GDP and not have its currency fall through the floor, I would have laughed at you. Since the yen didn’t collapse, we start having to look for other causes and effects. Read: China’s 2,000-year path to the top of the economic heap, in one chart When the next recession blows in, it will likely balloon the U.S. government deficit up to $2 trillion a year. The Obama administration took eight years to run up a $10 trillion debt after the 2008 recession. It might take just five years after the next recession to amass the next $10 trillion. Here is a chart my staff created in my free weekly newsletter, Thoughts From the Frontline (subscribe here), using Congressional Budget Office data, that shows what will happen if the next recession comes in 2018 and revenues drop by the same percentage as they did in the last recession (without even counting likely higher expenditures next time). And on top of the $1.3 trillion deficit that this chart predicts, you can add the more than $500 billion in off-budget debt that I mentioned above, plus higher interest rate expense as rates rise. By the early to mid 2020s, barring substantial increases in taxes or reductions in government benefits and entitlements, the deficit will be approaching $2 trillion annually. There will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. If you are in the top 25% of income earners in the United States, you have a big target painted on your income and wealth. The imposition of a VAT seems almost guaranteed. That is the only real way to boost revenues to offset the increases in entitlement spending. The Republicans don’t want to impose a VAT now as part of major tax reform. But a future Democratic administration and congressional majority will.

Early Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude supplies climbed by 4.6 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 1. The rise followed nine-consecutive weeks of declines. Forecasts for the supply data differed somewhat. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts forecast a rise of 2.7 million barrels for crude stocks, but a survey from The Wall Street Journal showed expectations for a larger rise of 5 million barrels. The American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday that U.S. crude supplies rose 2.8 million barrels last week. Crude-oil refinery inputs fell by 3.3 million barrels a day last week, to average 14.5 million barrels a day, while refineries operated at just 79.7% of capacity, the EIA said. “We do expect to see [crude] demand destruction not only in the Texas region but also in Florida with the impact of [Hurricane] Irma,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. “We do feel we will continue to see crude oil builds in the weeks to come due to the demand destruction and especially since we are past the summer driving season.” He expects to “continue to see builds [for crude supplies] in the weeks to come as we see refineries slowly come back online and we are also going to refinery maintenance season.” Gasoline stockpiles were down 3.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles edged down by 1.4 million barrels, according to the EIA. The S&P Global Platts survey showed forecasts for declines of 4.2 million in gasoline and 1.9 million barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.

Traders were also monitoring the development of Hurricane Irma which is heading toward Florida, where oil and gasoline demand could be affected. GasBuddy has been reporting big shortages of fuel at Florida gas stations ahead of the storm, with 41% of Gainesville stations without gas Thursday afternoon. Read: Hurricane Irma set to squeeze a lot more than just Florida’s oranges “So far, this [Atlantic] hurricane season has certainly had an extraordinary impact on the energy market, but almost exclusively thanks to Hurricane Harvey,” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report, told MarketWatch. “WTI was hit hard in the wake of Harvey’s landfall as a substantial percentage of Gulf Coast refineries were shut, essentially cutting oil demand by between 15% and 20%.” As of late Wednesday, about 12.7% of U.S. refining capacity remained down, according to S&P Global Platts. Separate data from the energy and commodities information provider showed that crude output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in August for the first time in five months. The group produced 32.65 million barrels a day in August, down 170,000 barrels a day from July. Natural-gas prices, meanwhile, saw a modest decline after separate EIA data Thursday showed that domestic supplies of the commodity rose by 65 billion cubic feet for the week ended Sept. 1.

                                   are capping costs of flights so that people can evacuate safely. Delta said this week it’s capping airfares for areas affected by the hurricane. On Friday, their airline said it also added more than 5,000 seats and 24 extra flights from San Juan, Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Key West since Wednesday. This comes after a Twitter user noted the company was increasing tickets from $547.59 to $3,258.50 for a flight out of Miami. A spokesman from Delta said that, contrary to this report, the airline has not raised any fares in response to the hurricane and that the price hike was related to dynamic pricing on the third-party travel site where the customer was booking the flight. George Hobica, founder of flight booking site Airfarewatchdog.com said the price increases were likely not intentional. “I don’t think airlines would be callous or stupid enough to be consciously jacking up fares,” he said. “If there’s any gouge, it’s just the last minute walk-up airfares that are designed for desperate business fliers.” “As the storm approached we actually reduced the price level of our highest fares (which are typically seen when customers are booking last-minute travel and inventory is limited) to and from cities in its projected path,” he said. American Airlines is also capping pre-tax fares at $99 for main cabin seats on direct flights out of Florida until Sept. 13, a spokesperson told MarketWatch. IT added additional flights from affected areas including St. Maarten (SXM), St. Kitts (SKB), Providenciales, Turks and Caicos (PLS); and San Juan, and Puerto Rico (SJU). JetBlue is capping direct flights out of Florida at $99 for direct flights or a maximum of $159 for connecting flights. “We want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights,” JetBlue spokesman Doug McGraw told Reuters. (JetBlue did not respond to request for comment.) In addition to cheap fares for those in Irma’s path, Frontier Airlines has been offering charitable support for victims of Hurricane Harvey. The company donated $1 of every ticket booked on Wednesday, Sept. 6 to the American Red Cross for hurricane relief efforts. The airline sent relief supplies to Houston on the first flight back to the area after operations were resumed and, for the next week, it is capping all fares to and from Houston at $99 one way. “We are able to make travel affordable in this time of need,” chief operating officer Jim Nides said in a statement. Other U.S. airlines are waiving fees for passengers re-booking flights in Caribbean destinations as well as Florida, including Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines. Under these changes, passengers can alter their itinerary without paying fees that normal amount to $200 or more per passenger. JetBlue shares have fallen 16% in 2017, Delta shares are down 3.7% and United shares have shed 17%.

Let’s start with Europe, the world’s second-largest economy. The European Union is a collection of states that are vastly different from one another. They are separated by culture, language (which impedes labor mobility, resulting in semipermanent labor productivity disparity between countries — think Greece and Germany), economic growth rates, indebtedness and history. European political (EU) and monetary (EMU) unions were great experiments that made a lot of sense on paper. Europe, at roughly the same-size population and economy as the U.S., was at a competitive disadvantage as dozens of currencies embedded extra transaction costs in cross-border trade, and each currency on its own had little chance of competing with the U.S. dollar

Germans were haunted by their past; they had started two world wars in the 20th century, and a united Europe was their way of lowering the risk of future European wars. Economic and monetary union sounded like a logical marriage of all the significant powers of post–World War II Europe, but the arrangement was never really a marriage. It was more like a civil union. EMU members combined their currencies into one, the euro

Read:  The world is becoming desperate about deflation Though treaties put limits on budget deficits (limits that, ironically, Germany was the first to exceed), each country went on spending its money as it wished. Some were relatively frugal (like Germany); others (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) went on spending binges, like newly hitched college students who had just gotten their first credit card, with an irresistibly low introductory rate and a free T-shirt. Now let’s turn to Brexit, the U.K. referendum on exiting the EU. Ironically, the U.K. doesn’t have half the problems that most EU nations are going through. Because it is not part of the EMU, it has retained its currency and its central bank. The U.K.’s main dissatisfaction with EU membership stems from the immigration issue. Because treaties have turned the EU into a borderless union, when Germany accepted refugees from the Middle East and Northern Africa, it basically made a unilateral decision on behalf of all EU members to accept those refugees to all EU countries. High unemployment, wage stagnation and terrorism are now endemic in the EU, and you can see how the U.K.’s citizenry might have a problem with this. After the Brexit vote, the financial media lit up with opinions on its consequences for the EU and the global economy. They’ve varied from “Brexit is a nonevent” to “This is a Lehman moment for the global economy,” referring to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that almost brought the financial system to a halt in 2008. The arguments on both sides are quite convincing. The argument for Brexit’s being a nonevent is simple and straightforward. The U.K. maintained its currency, and the pound’s

There is a fear that the EU may impose trade sanctions on U.K., not so much to punish the U.K. but to threaten other EU members that exit will come at a stiff economic cost (effectively turning this voluntary club into a prison). However, the U.K. is a net importer of goods from the EU; thus any sanctions will hurt remaining EU members more than the U.K. The Lehman moment argument is less simple, but not unimaginable. Brexit may provide the spark that will ignite already gasoline-soaked ground. Though the EU and EMU were supposed to unite Europeans, they may have had the opposite effect — causing a groundswell of nationalism. In all honesty, Italy is more concerning than the U.K. Italy is the third-largest economy in the EU, and its debt stands at 132% of GDP, second only to Greece (171%). Seventeen percent of Italian bank loans are noncurrent. In the depths of the financial crisis, that number was 5% in the U.S. Italian lenders account for nearly half of bad debt in the EU. If Italy was not part of the EMU, it could just print lire and bail out its banks. But it gave up that luxury when it joined the single currency. To make things worse, in 2014 the EU passed a law that prohibits governments from bailing out their banking systems; thus the shareholders, debtholders, and depositors may bear the brunt of the eventual bailout. Unless the EU passes a new law that bends the 2014 law — or the Italian government takes matters into its own hands, violating EU rules — we may see Italian debtholders and depositors hit with the cost of bank bailouts take to the streets and demand “Italexit.” Nationalism is a highly emotional, zero-sum, us-against-them sort of business. Add immigration concerns on top of economic ones, and it’s not hard to see how Europe has turned into a highly combustible mixture looking for a match. And because emotions are often antilogical, future decisions by EU countries may not necessarily be beneficial to the European Continent. Given that the situation in Europe is so complex and combustible, it’s unclear whether Brexit will be just another match that simply burns out or the one that starts the fire. Will it trigger other exits? Will it slow down EU growth, thus straining an already leveraged system? No one knows. Meanwhile, China is the world’s second-largest economy and is experiencing the largest debt bubble we’ll probably ever see in our lifetimes. From 2007 to 2014, the country’s debt quadrupled, to $28 trillion from $7 trillion. Over the same period, China’s economy grew to $10.5 trillion from $3.5 trillion. These numbers are staggering and point to one indisputable fact: All Chinese growth since 2007 has come from borrowing. There was no miracle in it. But it gets worse, much worse. The numbers also show that every $1 of new debt brought only pennies of GDP growth. In the absence of skyrocketing debt, the Chinese overcapacity bubble, which was already fully inflated pre-2007, would have burst years ago. As the government continues to engineer growth by borrowing, every yuan of debt will bring less growth. The laws of economics have not been suspended in China. American economist Herbert Stein’s law states that things that cannot go on forever, won’t. When its debt bubble bursts, China will become a headwind for global growth. This brings us to Japan. It is the most-indebted developed nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 230%. Japan is the proof of Stein’s law — its economy is still suffering a hangover from what at the time seemed like an endless real estate party (bubble) that lasted from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s. Japan has been on the quantitative easing and endless stimulus bandwagon longer than anyone else and has nothing (except a lot of debt) to show for it. Japan also has the oldest population in the world — 26% of its people are older than 65 (in the U.S. the figure is 15%). Rising debt and an aging population are a double negative for the economy, as debt per capita is rising at an even faster rate than total debt. And since the working population is declining at an even faster rate than the population as a whole, debt per working person is growing at an even faster rate. Given this reality, you might think Japan is paying the highest interest rates in the world, perhaps somewhere in the high teens. Wrong. The Japanese 10-year goverment bond carries a negative yield. This is an overview of the challenging environment facing investors around the world. It’s evident that stock market performance has not been driven by the improving health of the global economy. Just as negative interest rates are not a positive for the continued health of the economy, current stock market performance does not augur rosy future returns for stocks. In fact, the opposite is true. So, how does one invest in this overvalued market? Our strategy is spelled out    in this fairly lengthy article.

108,Andrea Riquier,9142017,MarketWatch,9072017,"Published: Sept 8, 2017 5:23 p.m. ET ‘A catastrophic storm that this state has never seen,’ Florida governor warns residents By Winds from Hurricane Irma, already the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, on Friday picked up speed as it barreled toward Florida, prompting Gov. Rick Scott to urge all Floridians to evacuate. “Based on what we know, the majority of Florida will have major hurricane impact and deadly winds,” Scott said in a news conference. “We expect this along the entire East Coast and West Coast.” At 5 p.m. Eastern, Irma was about 345 miles southeast of Miami, with winds reaching speeds of 155 miles an hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane was projected to reach the Florida Keys and southern tip of the peninsula by Sunday morning. Hurricane Jose was right behind it. The first hurricane hunter plane to make contact with Jose, on Friday morning, found it “much stronger than previously estimated,” the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane, which is smaller than Irma but packing winds that are blowing just as fast, is forecast to pass near or east of the Leeward Islands by Saturday. Multiple counties issued mandatory evacuation orders spanning their entire county, including St. Johns, Nassau, Glynn, Camden, Atlantic Beach, and Flagler. “This is a catastrophic storm that this state has never seen,” Gov. Scott said Friday.

President Donald Trump’s seaside Mar-a-Lago resort was also ordered to evacuate beginning Friday morning, along with the barrier islands and low-lying areas of Palm Beach County, the Sun Sentinel newspaper confirmed. Trump has owned the private golf club since 1985. The president has vacationed and conducted business there numerous times early in his presidency, including hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other foreign leaders, sometimes raising controversy over security. Read also:  Hurricane Irma set to squeeze a lot more than just Florida’s oranges Irma has already rampaged through a string of Caribbean islands, leaving at least 19 people dead and many injured. The tiny island of Barbuda of about 1,600 inhabitants has been “totally demolished,” while 95% of St. Martin—a popular destination with U.S. and European travelers—has been destroyed. The Red Cross estimates that at least 1.2 million people have been battered by Irma. Read: Tiny island of Barbuda ‘practically uninhabitable’ in Irma’s devastating wake Trump also owns properties in that region, including a multimillion-dollar mansion on St. Martin that is listed for sale, according to the Miami Herald. It remained unclear what had happened to the property, but French officials said that the four most solid buildings on the island had “suffered serious damage,” making it unlikely Trump’s house had been spared. Puerto Rico narrowly avoided a direct hit as the eye moved northwest about 50 miles offshore, but were still lashed with rains and heavy winds. Nearly 900,000 people were reportedly without power, and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority gave a stunning warning Wednesday that parts of the island could be without electricity for up to six months. Cruise operators have been forced to cancel and reroute sailings, while thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled due to Irma. Read now:  Taking a cruise, flight or hotel room in the path of Hurricane Irma? Here’s what you need to know… Due to #HurricaneIrma, please confirm that your flight is operating before coming to the airport. Many flights have been canceled. Hurricane Jose is on its way to the Caribbean islands of Barbuda, St. Martin and Anguilla, all of which have already taken heavy damage from Irma. A Hurricane Watch is in effect for all three islands, and rainfall of up to 5 inches is expected to maintain or even add to existing flooding. Additionally, Katia, a Category 1 hurricane, is still strengthening in the Mexican Gulf, and now has maximum sustained winds of 105 miles an hour. A Hurricane Warning is in effect for Cabo Rojo to Laguna Verde. The center of the storm will make landfall in Mexico later Friday or early Saturday. “Some intensification” was possible before landfall, followed by “rapid weakening,” the NHC said in its latest advisory. The trio of hurricanes comes just two weeks after Harvey brought widespread destruction to the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, estimated by AccuWeather to have caused damages of up to $190 billion. If realized, that would make it the costliest-ever U.S. national disaster. But Irma could top that. On Friday, Bryan Norcross, a senior Weather Channel hurricane specialist, called Irma “extraordinary” on his Facebook page. He told The Wall Street Journal that “the odds favor this being the most expensive natural disaster in the history of the United States” in part because of the storm’s size, and because of the population in her path.

                                   meanwhile, slipped 31.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 6,429.08. A reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000. Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday’s data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher. “CPI was a bit above expectations,” but market participants can’t be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed’s 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was “not so strong that it’s likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.” Inflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve’s target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017. On Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session. The equity market’s continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations. “The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,” said Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945. However, Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. “If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,” he said. “Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,” he said. “But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,” Kepner added, referring to a decline of at least 20%. Read:  Stock market’s 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls Earlier Thursday, North Korea made more threats in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and “reduce the U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness.” The acerbic rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports. Economic and political news: The Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.

On the political front, President Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to be nearing a deal to give legal status to the children of illegal immigrants. Trump tweeted early Thursday that no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement with him to enact protections for “Dreamers” in exchange for increased border-security measures that don’t include funding for a wall.

Monster Hurricane Irma slammed into Caribbean islands today after making landfall in Barbuda, packing ferocious winds and causing major flooding in low-lying areas. As the rare Category Five storm barreled its way across the Caribbean, it brought gusting winds of up to 185 miles per hour (294 kilometers per hour), weather experts said. PHOTO: AFP. WASHINGTON: Irma has been downgraded to a Category Four hurricane but is still extremely dangerous, the National Hurricane Center said on Friday. The storm raging in the Caribbean which is en route to Florida is now packing maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 kilometres per hour), the agency said its 0900 GMT update. Hurricane Irma kills at least eight on French island of Saint-Martin That is down from speeds of 185 mph when Irma was at its peak as a Category Five hurricane.

But, unfortunately, it looks as if it will. For investors, there may be trading opportunities, as shares of some companies may be punished more than they should be. For them, it is important to consider the following three scenarios: • Damage is less than expected • Damage is in line with expectations • Damage is worse than expectations To understand the trading setups, let us start with a chart.

                                   an insurance company that does a lot of business in Florida. The chart shows that the stock has fallen to the first support zone in anticipation of large damages from Hurricane Irma. It also shows the second support zone. It appears that investors are anticipating about $40 billion-$50 billion of insured losses in Florida. As a reference, Hurricane Andrew, which was somewhat similar to Hurricane Irma, caused $15.5 billion of insured losses in 1992. Since 1992, the value of the dollar has fallen and there has been more construction. According to some estimates, if Hurricane Andrew were to hit today, the insured losses would be about $50 billion. From a trading perspective, if the damage is significantly less than anticipated, the stock may not only recover the entire loss, but may go even higher to the zone shown on the chart. The reason is that after the hurricane, insurance companies may be able to raise rates. Furthermore, if the stock starts moving higher, a short squeeze may propel the stock artificially higher than the fundamentals may warrant. Similar reasoning can be used to trade other scenarios. If the damage is less than expected, the pre-hurricane moves will reverse themselves.

The problem with buying or short-selling these stocks and ETFs now is that the storm is not projected to hit until Sunday, when the markets are closed. On Monday these stocks can gap up or down, potentially making a lot of money or losing a lot of money for investors. There is no good way to control risk at this time. That’s why it’s best to wait until Monday, even at the cost of missing any opportunities.

112,Ann Skeet,9142017,MarketWatch,9072017,"Published: Sept 7, 2017 2:55 p.m. ET U.S. Constitution offers leaders a way to resolve ethical dilemmas By President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and then ask Congress for a law to resolve this thorny immigration issue, underscores an ethical dilemma faced by people in formal leadership roles. It is a common challenge for those in top jobs who have one title but many roles and duties that are, at times, in conflict with one another. How can leaders meet these challenges? The president is the country’s chief legislator, commander-in-chief, chief diplomat, administrator, and magistrate.  The responsibilities are identified in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, which states, ""He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" Some see Trump’s direction to Congress  earlier this week to “legalize DACA,” without recommending his own legislation, as lacking executive leadership. Trump has chosen to place greater weight on his duties as chief magistrate, to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed” than the power he has to recommend new laws. In contrast, former President Barack Obama chose to emphasize his role as chief executive, using an executive order to create DACA and grant a reprieve of the laws as applied to young immigrants he identified as contributors to our country and owed certain rights. It is not uncommon for different people in the same position to emphasize different aspects of their role as a signal of their leadership priorities. Trump’s DACA decision follows through on an oft-stated campaign promise. He is both demonstrating compassion for those affected, and is allowing Congress to play its role by drafting this important immigration legislation. These are all positive elements of ethical leadership. We offer a framework for ethical decision-making at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. It prompts people facing challenging decisions to ask questions to weigh rights and perspectives that can be add odds with one another, drawing on philosophical traditions. These include: Which option produces the most good or does the least harm? Which protects the rights of all who have a stake? Which treats people equally or proportionately? Which best serves the community as a whole? Which leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be? Two additional areas of position and mission can aid leaders faced with such dilemmas, namely:  What do the duties of my position call for me to do, and which interests am I asked to protect?  What is the mission of the organization or group I am leading?  Am I acting in a way that is consistent with that mission? I view this well-known sentence from the Declaration of Independence to be our country’s vision statement, our aspirations for a future ideal:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” What about guidance the president and Congress can find in the country’s mission?  Scholars and courts have turned to the Constitution’s preamble as embodying the purpose and principles of our federal government. To me, this serves as America’s mission statement: “We the People, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.” Presidents take an oath to uphold the Constitution. Can we find additional guidance from the document’s principles? Take the preamble and derive some questions from it, an exercise I recommend for organizations seeking to define ethical behavior and decisions. Does this option offer justice? Is it fair, treating people equally or proportionately? Does this option insure domestic tranquility? Does it keep the peace? Does this option provide for the common defense — keeping our country safe from attack? Does this option promote the general welfare — the health, happiness, and fortunes of a person or group? Does this option secure the blessings of liberty — a freedom from oppressive restrictions for people now and in the future? Congress has other places to turn for direction. Each of the U.S. departments represented in the cabinet has a mission statement.  For example, here’s the mission statement for the Department of Defense: “Create a more secure, democratic and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community.” If Congress can use questions derived from mission and purpose of both the U.S. and the federal government to address young people currently without immigration status because of decisions made by their parents, then legislation should emerge that garners broad-based support and is signed by the president.

That was boosted by a 9% rally after AeroVironment reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings last month. While Chinese drone maker DJI has crushed much of the competition for consumer drones, commercial drone makers are finding success, especially in military and enterprise applications. AeroVironment, which makes drones both for reconnaissance and as lethal weapons, is increasingly turning to small drones, about the size of a water bottle. “The demand for our small UAS products and solutions internationally is strong and continues to be strong,” AeroVironment Chief Executive Wahid Nawabi said during the company’s quarterly earnings call last week. Aerovironment has delivered 30 of its Snipe drones to the U.S. Department of Defense. The 5-ounce, cell phone-sized camera drone has motors so quiet that it is difficult to detect, and is used for reconnaissance. AeroVironment sells its drones to 40 other countries, and this quarter signed contracts with the Australian military and an unnamed Middle East customer. “We are impressed with continued international demand for small UAS,” analysts at Raymond James said in a note last week. Another drone maker focused on enterprise and defense, Israeli-based Airobotics, announced on Thursday that it had nabbed $32.5 million in funding. Meanwhile, China’s DJI has been the subject of controversy recently after a leaked memo indicated that the U.S. Army would discontinue using its drones due to “cyber vulnerabilities.” Some drone service providers have also said their clients will not allow them to use DJI products because of related security concerns. And while DJI has a massive market share in the consumer market, those security concerns could be an opportunity for other drone makers to leap into the commercial side of the market. “Our small UAS solutions are designed to be highly secure and reliable,” AeroVironment’s Nawabi said, in reference to the DJI news. The U.S. Army later clarified that it could continue using DJI drones if the software passes a security check. DJI also followed up on the news by releasing a new flight mode that stops internet traffic to and from the app that operates it, in order to provide enhanced data-privacy assurances for sensitive government and enterprise customers. Nawabi indicated that recent rulings by the Federal Aviation Administration are holding back aspects of the commercial drone market. The FAA currently does not allow commercial pilots to fly at night, over people, or to fly drones beyond their line of sight without special permission. So while a farmer might be able to fly a drone over their farmland, an electric utilities company that has thousands of miles of transmission lines would not be able to legally use a drone. “The FAA will play, and is going to play, a critical role as an enabling factor for the adoption of this market,” Nawabi said. There are more than 60,000 licensed commercial drone operators in the United States, according to the FAA. The FAA said in a statement Wednesday that it “is using a risk-based approach to enable increasingly more complex UAS operations,” but added that current restrictions on commercial drone use would likely be eased.

115,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called their “last best chance” to repeal Obamacare while a new analysis underscored how Democratic-leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. With no Democratic support for the bill, Republicans remain a handful of votes short in the Senate, needing 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48, with Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. Senator Rand Paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Asked whether the legislation will pass, Pence said, “We’ll see. We’re close.” Republicans, still reeling from their failure in July to win Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, have set a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. “This may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head America back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that’s based on individual-choice, state-based innovations,” Pence told Fox New Channel. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. The current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet assessed the bill’s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on Thursday that states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non-expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. The Graham-Cassidy bill in 2020 would end the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which many Democratic-governed states had carried out while many Republican-governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five-decade-old program regardless of how many Americans qualify for its benefits. Republicans have called Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020-2026: New York (down 35 percent), Oregon (down 32 percent), Connecticut (down 31 percent), Vermont (down 31 percent) and Minnesota (down 30 percent). All are Democratic leaning. The analysis found that six Republican-leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: Mississippi (up 148 percent), Texas (up 75 percent), Kansas (up 61 percent), Georgia (up 46 percent), South Dakota (up 45 percent) and Tennessee (up 44 percent). In total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is California, losing $56 billion. The biggest gainer would be Texas, with a $34 billion increase. California, the most populous U.S. state, is Democratic leaning. Texas is the second most populous state and the largest Republican-leaning one. “It’s absolutely true to say the Graham-Cassidy bill over time levels out on a per-person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which I think resonates with most Americans,” Pence said. McCain, Collins and Murkowski were the three Republicans who voted against the last Republican healthcare legislation brought up in the Senate, which failed 51-49 in July. Paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on Thursday went to Twitter to underscore his criticism that the Graham-Cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase Obamacare. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. More medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the Graham-Cassidy bill on Thursday, including the American Psychological Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NAACP. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. The Graham-Cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.

116,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"Pfizer said in the suit that J&J is offering discounts on its Remicade treatment in exchange for essentially excluding Pfizer’s drug from insurance coverage, keeping it out of the hands of patients. J&J said in an e-mailed statement that the lawsuit was without merit and that the company is competing on value and price. “To date Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value to patients, providers, payers and employers,” said Scott White, President of Janssen Biotech Inc, a unit of J&J. J&J signed exclusionary contracts with health insurers, hospitals and doctor groups after U.S. regulators approved it as a reasonable substitute for Remicade in 2016, Pfizer said. Both Aetna and Anthem declined to comment. Other U.S. insurers contacted for this story did not have an immediate comment. Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the suit. Its Inflectra rival is priced 19 percent lower than that list price. But Pfizer said it has not been able to reach customers because of J&J’s anticompetitive actions. The suit comes at a time when insurers, consumers and the U.S. government have pushed for lower drug prices, saying double-digit annual price increases are unsustainable. Biosimilars are intended to be lower cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But because they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be. Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J’s contracts with many insurers exclusively pay for Remicade and only pay for Inflectra in limited cases where patients “fail first” on Remicade. In return, Pfizer said, J&J pays after-market rebates on both new and existing customers’ Remicade purchases. To make up for the J&J rebates and discounts on this large base of old and new customers, Pfizer said it would need to price Inflectra below its own average variable cost. Pfizer shares were up 1.3 percent, or 45 cents, at $35.90 and J&J shares fell 1.6 percent, or $2.10, to $133.11. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. ","

117,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the Obama era, according to data reviewed by Reuters. The more intense scrutiny of the applications for H-1B visas comes after President Donald Trump called for changes to the visa program so that it benefits the highest-paid workers, though he has not enacted any such reforms. Data provided by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows that between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, the agency issued 85,000 challenges, or “requests for evidence” (RFEs), to H-1B visa petitions - a 45 percent increase over the same period last year. The total number of H-1B petitions rose by less than 3 percent in the same period. The challenges, which can slow down the issuance of visas by months, were issued at a greater rate in 2017 than at any time in the Obama administration except for one year, 2009, according to the USCIS data, which has not been previously reported. The trend is likely to cheer supporters of Trump’s hardline stance on immigration. They say visas for skilled foreigners undercut American workers by replacing them with low-paid employees shipped in from abroad. But major tech companies, universities and hospitals contend the visas allow them to fill highly specialized jobs for which there are sometimes few qualified Americans. The USCIS inquiries typically challenge the basis of the original petitions and assert that the employers do not qualify for the visas. Employers and their lawyers must then provide further evidence to prove their need and eligibility for the visas. To be sure, the Obama administration also issued a large number of H-1B challenges – nearly 59,000 - from January through August 2016, and a similar number in 2015. Immigration attorneys have for years complained about redundant and burdensome challenges to high-skilled employment visas. But they say they are seeing a new trend in the Trump era. In addition to querying applications more often, the Trump administration is targeting entry-level jobs offered to skilled foreigners. The lawyers say this violates the law governing H-1Bs, because it allows for visa holders to take entry-level jobs. Several attorneys said they view the increase in challenges and focus on entry-level jobs as a stealth campaign by the administration against the H-1B program in the absence of public regulatory changes or changes passed by Congress, which could be debated and decided in the open. “One way to have an immigration policy that’s consistent with the policy that’s been articulated by the Trump administration is to put more scrutiny on H-1B cases,” said Cyrus Mehta, a New York-based immigration attorney. USCIS spokesman Robert C. Langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyers or the sharp spike in RFEs this year. In an email, he said the agency is applying “currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirements to evaluate petitions.” Partners HealthCare is a healthcare system that includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, two prestigious teaching hospitals for Harvard Medical School. It has received more than 50 RFEs from USCIS so far this year, compared to fewer than 15 all of last year in response to a similar number of H-1B petitions, said Anthony Pawelski, an immigration attorney who handles H-1B applications for Partners. USCIS questioned the hospitals’ connection to the university even though their applications included proof of their non-profit status, a 1948 agreement between Harvard Medical School and the hospitals and even text from the hospitals’ website referencing a 200-year history with the university, Pawelski said. “They’re doing anything they can to delay the processing and adjudications and in their mind close any perceived loopholes,” he said. Langston declined to comment on specific H-1B petitions. It is still unclear how the increase in challenges will affect the number of visas issued this year. In the 2016 fiscal year, USCIS approved 87 percent of H1-B petitions. By June 30 of this year, the agency had approved 59 percent of H-1B petitions, although that number is incomplete because it does not take into account the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, when a large portion of H-1B applications are processed. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized H-1B visas, because the biggest beneficiaries are outsourcing firms, which critics say use the program to fill lower-level information technology jobs and replace American workers. Members of both parties have introduced legislation this year to reform the visa’s use. In an April executive order, Trump directed a review of the H1-B program, aimed at ensuring the visas “are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid” applicants. The order itself did not implement changes but directed agencies to suggest reforms. “What the Trump administration has done for the first time in a very long time is take seriously the fact that companies are misusing the H-1B system,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The group opposes the H-1B program but supports giving more high-skilled foreigners employment-based permanent residence. Many of the government challenges for visas for entry-level jobs either say that the salary should be higher because the job is too complex or that the job does not count as a “specialty” occupation, as required by the H-1B program, according to a review of hundreds of RFEs by the American Immigration Lawyers Association provided to Reuters. Entry-level jobs are positions for fresh university graduates with little or no work experience. Such jobs can pay “Level 1” wages, the lowest of four tiers. “An RFE may be justified if the wage level is not appropriate for the position,” said Langston, the USCIS spokesman. The USCIS data did not specify what positions the RFEs challenged or the reasons for the challenges. Lawyers question the implicit argument advanced by USCIS in the challenges - that specialty jobs cannot be entry-level. They point to young doctors and engineers, for instance, who may not have work experience but have spent years learning technical skills. Though the challenges can come across all industries, the AILA review showed software developers and computer systems analysts were challenged more often than other jobs. Silicon Valley tech giants either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on whether they had been receiving more RFEs. The requests can increase legal fees associated with each H-1B visa by as much as half, attorneys said. Government fees for H-1B visas can run upwards of $2,500, and standard fees paid to lawyers per application can easily reach $2,000 or more. The increased costs and hassle could discourage employers from hiring such foreign workers especially at junior levels, immigration lawyers said. Jeffrey Gorsky, an attorney with Berry Appelman & Leiden LLP, one of the largest corporate immigration firms in the country, said one of the firm’s clients, a mid-sized tech company, was hit with six RFEs from USCIS in a single day this year. Between late 2015 and the end of 2016, the company received just one RFE on an H-1B visa petition, he said. ","

118,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chalk one up for the nationalists. Among the many signals that Donald Trump sent in his speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, one was especially clear: former chief strategist Steve Bannon’s White House departure has not muted the president’s “America First” foreign policy instincts. Trump’s eight months in office have been characterized by a sometimes dramatic tug-of-war between “globalists” and “nationalist” advisers who have sought to move the president in myriad ways on issues both domestic and international. Bannon’s exit last month caused some of the former New York businessman’s core supporters to fret that the more multilateral-leaning group inside the administration had gained ground. Not on foreign policy, at least not on Tuesday. Trump’s strident defence of national sovereignty during his debut at the annual U.N. General Assembly showed his campaign-honed policy inclinations very much intact and presented a Trump Doctrine to the world that focused unabashedly on the U.S. homeland. “The chief nationalist in this administration is Donald J. Trump. And he knows what he’s trying to say,” said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a Trump supporter. He said the speech showed that Trump had a doctrine that was defined by more than tweets, with roots in the conservative philosophies of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, France’s Charles de Gaulle, and Britain’s Margaret Thatcher. “It’s not a one-sided American nationalism, it’s a re-centring on sovereignty that’s really, really important,” Gingrich said. The speech, in which Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if attacked, divided Trump’s supporters and opponents. Ben Rhodes, an adviser to former Democratic President Barack Obama, said Trump was upending international order with threats of war and attacks on diplomacy. It did not divide Trump’s often warring advisers, however, an administration official said. “It was the most collaborative speech among the senior people in the national security cabinet that the president has given to date,” the official said. He said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stood up after Trump’s speech and shook chief speechwriter Stephen Miller’s hand and said “you did a great job.” Miller is considered a nationalist and an ally of Bannon, while Tillerson is more globally minded. “This was more ... Trump just being Trump,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser, adding he thought the nationalist versus globalist tension in the administration played itself out more on domestic policy issues such as immigration policy. The administration has given mixed signals on foreign policy, too. Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser and a member of the so-called globalist wing, had to clarify with U.S. allies this week that Trump still intended to pull the United States out of the Paris climate change agreement unless there were a renegotiation to make it more favourable for U.S. interests. But Trump seemed to stun some people in the United Nations hall, despite his well-known penchant for blunt talk. His speech included a condemnation of the Iran nuclear agreement reached with U.S. allies under Obama, and an observation that some portions of the world were “going to hell”. Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations, said allies would interpret the speech as a sign that Trump was wary of undertaking major commitments around the world. “Neither of the biggest problems, North Korea and Iran, can be solved by an America First, Lone Ranger policy,” he said, adding the speech showed that globalists within his administrations were “throwaways” and that Trump was still driven by nationalism.

119,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called on the United States on Friday to withdraw Peace Corps volunteers in an escalating row over accusations that U.S. agents conspired with an opposition leader to plot treason. Hun Sen was responding after the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh issued a travel warning that urged citizens to show caution amid “anti-American rhetoric by officials”. “Are you scaring Cambodians?” Hun Sen said of the United States in an address to garment workers at factories which export much of their production to the United States. “Are you prepared to invade Cambodia and that’s why you told Americans to be careful? It’s good if you pull out the Peace Corps,” Hun Sen said. The U.S. embassy declined to comment. It has previously dismissed the accusations of collusion with opposition leader Kem Sokha and called for his release. On Friday, the embassy was swearing in 71 new volunteers from the Peace Corps, which sends Americans abroad to help with local projects with the stated goal of promoting mutual understanding. Hun Sen said on Friday that he had ordered an investigation into whether any Americans were involved with Kem Sokha. Opponents of Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics ahead of a general election next year. The evidence presented against Kem Sokha is a video recorded in 2013 in which he discusses a strategy to win power with the help of unspecified Americans. Hun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests this year from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit to forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave. On Thursday, Hun Sen said he was suspending cooperation with Washington to find the remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. According to the U.S Embassy, more than 500 Peace Corps volunteers have served and worked in Cambodia since 2006, providing English teaching and teacher training as well as community health education. U.S. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961 to promote world peace and friendship. ","

120,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea told a U.N. rights panel that international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs would endanger the survival of North Korean children. Han Tae Song, Pyongyang’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, was speaking at a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child late on Wednesday. The panel of independent experts challenged North Korean officials over allegations of forced child labor, sexual abuse and trafficking in North Korea, Pyongyang’s health and education budget, and Internet access for children. Han said North Korea, whose population is 26 million, is a “people-centered socialist country... where protection and promotion of the rights and welfare of the child are given top priority ... There is room for improvement.” But Han said that new sanctions imposed by the United States and the U.N. Security Council over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests were hampering the production of nutritional goods for children and provision of textbooks. “The persistent and vicious blockade and sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) are not only hampering the endeavors for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child but also seriously threatening their right to survival,” he said, calling for sanctions to be lifted. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. Han said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un - denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump as “Rocket Man” - “personally guides the construction in different parts of the country of schoolchildren’s palaces, children’s hospitals, baby homes, children’s homes, and primary and secondary boarding schools and works with devotion for the well-being of the young generation”. South Korea approved a plan on Thursday to send $8 million worth of aid to North Korea as China warned the crisis on the divided Korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington continued. The U.N. panel asked how North Korea’s “songbun” (caste system) that ranks citizens based on family loyalty to the ruling dynasty affected children’s access to education, health and food. The North Korean delegation replied that this was an “imaginary concept” invented by hostile forces. Human Rights Watch has called on the rights panel to press North Korea’s delegation on cases of child sexual abuse, which the New York-based group said it had documented. “The (North Korean government) report was silent on the issue of sexual abuse so the delegation was asked to provide data,” read a U.N. summary of the hearing. North Korea’s delegation said that forced child labor did not exist in the country and was banned, and that the maximum duration of young people’s work in agricultural fields was limited to three weeks per year. “In response to a question on the use of the Internet, the delegation explained that there was public control of this medium in order to give preference to access to positive information for children. In addition, all children had access to the (North Korean internal) Intranet,” the summary said. The committee will issue its conclusions on Oct. 4. ","

121,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and other countries opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will not support the reconstruction of the country until there is a political transition “away from Assad,” British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday. The “Friends of Syria” group, an alliance of mainly Western and Gulf Arab countries, met in New York on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly at a time when the conflict in Syria, now in its seventh year, appears to be less urgent with attention focused on the North Korean nuclear threat and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal. “We believe that the only way forward is to get a political process going and to make it clear to the Iranians, Russians and Assad regime that we, the like-minded group, will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is such a political process and that means, as Resolution 2254 says, to a transition away from Assad,” Johnson said. He was speaking after a meeting of about 14 countries that back the Syrian opposition including France, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States. The U.N. Security Council has adopted a Syria transition road map through a Geneva-led process. Russia joined the war on Assad’s behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favour. Assad also enjoys robust support from Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the moderate Syrian opposition is moribund and the United States has largely stepped back from a leading role in Syrian diplomacy. Earlier this year the Trump administration also halted the CIA’s covert program to equip and train certain rebel groups fighting Assad. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, David Satterfield, said all those at the meeting agreed that “there has got to be a political process if there is to be any international participation in the reconstruction of Syria.” “The regime and the regime supporters cannot declare a victory solely based on a map and colours of positions on the ground,” Satterfield said. “The reconstruction of Syria depends very much on that credible political process. That political process is focused on Geneva and the role of the United Nations.” The meeting on Monday was in stark contrast to last year’s which took place after a ceasefire deal between the United States and Russia effectively collapsed when an aid convoy was bombed in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city. Aleppo is now in the hands of Assad’s forces and Assad himself is in a much stronger position, thanks to Russian and Iranian support. The last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), which included Iran, was cast aside after Syrian government forces retook the rebel stronghold of Aleppo in 2016. Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in Astana to try to reduce the violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long-term political solution “We discussed here how to bring it back to the U.N.-led process and Geneva,” Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström told Reuters. Asked if there was consensus on that, she said “I would say so.” “It’s good if the Astana process leads to de-escalation and a reduction of the violence but it has to lead into the political process.” Earlier on Monday, France warned that the status quo in Syria risked leading to the country’s permanent fragmentation and opening the door to new radical Islamist groups. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in New York he would hold a meeting with the four other permanent members of the Security Council - Britain, China, Russia and the United States - on Thursday to persuade them to create a contact group to give new impetus to end the seven-year conflict. Le Drian said “realism” dictated that Assad could not stay in power after millions of Syrians had fled the country due to the war, but that it was vital major powers worked together to help revive U.N.-brokered peace talks in Geneva. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said the French contact group proposal was not discussed at the Friends of Syria meeting. But Riyad Hijab, a prominent Syrian opposition leader, said he told French President Emmanuel Macron that the initiative was important in part because “of American withdrawal and Russia is dominating the entire process. So Mr. Macron’s initiative  is the right way to fix this because it’s vital all five (permanent Security Council members) are involved in the process.” ","

122,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"The deal would make an unlikely pairing. Jollibee has a huge following in the Philippines, as well as with Filipinos overseas, for its burgers and other fast-food meals. Pret, meanwhile, has built its reputation selling organic coffee and wholesome sandwiches to office workers in Britain and in cities like Hong Kong and New York. Jollibee had been holding talks with an advisor over an offer for Pret, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks were not public. The sources said Jollibee’s offer could value Pret at over $1 billion, based on its 2016 core earnings of just over 93 million pounds. A successful bid by Jollibee would mark the biggest overseas deals to date by the Flipino company, and potentially one of the biggest ever outbound deals from the Philippines. Jollibee, with a market value of $5.2 billion, operates the largest food service network in the Philippines with 2,700 restaurant outlets, including its eponymous chain of fast food stores with the ubiquitous smiling bee logo. But it has also been expanding across Southeast Asia and beyond, hoping to appeal to lucrative local consumers as well as Filipino expatriates with coffee, donut and noodle offerings. Pret, a chain with more than 400 shops worldwide, has built its reputation selling gourmet baguettes and offerings like wild crayfish-and-rocket sandwiches to office workers, and has since embraced health options like dairy-free coconut porridge. Citing sources, Reuters reported earlier this year that Pret’s private equity owner, Bridgepoint, was preparing for a New York listing later this year. Pret reported 2016 revenues of 776 million pounds ($1.1 billion). Still, the company’s interest in Pret is still at an early stage and it has not yet finalised a valuation or had direct discussions with Pret, one of the sources said. Jollibee declined to comment on Pret but said acquisition of new businesses was part of its growth strategy. “Very few selected companies reach completion‎ of acquisition, while the vast majority of potential targets does not,” Chief Financial Officer Ysmael V. Baysa told Reuters in an emailed response. Baysa said Jollibee had not submitted a formal or informal bid for any company in recent months. Bridgepoint and Pret declined to comment when reached by Reuters. Jollibee’s most recent expansion move was the acquisition in 2015 of a 40 percent stake in Smashburger, a U.S.-based chain, for roughly $100 million, a deal that already marked a shift towards higher end ready-to-grab meals. The unsolicited offer for Pret, however, would also have to compete with the likely valuation from the potential listing. Jollibee’s foreign businesses - including joint ventures in China, the United States and Vietnam - account for 30 percent of its system-wide global sales. That is a measure of all sales to consumers both from company-owned and franchised stores. Pret would mark a more dramatic step, however, given its network of more than 400 shops globally, with the majority based in the United Kingdom. Bridgepoint bought the Pret chain at the height of the buyout boom in 2008 for 500 million euros ($539 million). ($1 = 0.7362 pounds) ($1 = 51.1630 Philippine pesos) ","

123,,9212017,Reuters,9142017,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia on Thursday defended its anti-narcotics efforts after U.S. President Donald Trump said he considered downgrading the country in a White House assessment because of an uptick in the cultivation of coca, the base ingredient for cocaine. Tens of millions of dollars in development and security funding and logistical help could be in danger should the United States decide the South American country is not doing enough, and such a decision could even jeopardize Colombia’s access to monies from multilateral organizations. The two countries have long been close allies in the fight against illegal narcotics but in recent years have broadened the focus of their relationship to include trade and Colombia’s peace process with leftist guerrillas. However, Trump said this week he had contemplated declaring in the White House’s annual review of countries it considers hubs for narcotics trafficking that Colombia is not meeting its drug fight obligations because of decade-high coca production. The government of President Juan Manuel Santos took issue with Trump’s statement. “Colombia is without a doubt the country which most has fought drugs, and which has had the most success on that front,” the government said in an early morning statement. “No one has to threaten us to confront this challenge.” In the last seven years, the country has confiscated 1,621 tonnes of cocaine, the statement said. The United States has expressed its worry about a sharp uptick in coca cultivation and cocaine production at the close of last year, after Colombia signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), its largest rebel group, and halted the spraying of powerful herbicide glyphosate over health worries. Coca cultivation was up to 188,000 hectares (464,000 acres), while cocaine production capacity climbed to 700 tonnes annually, the highest figures for at least a decade. Colombia is counting on more than $400 million in funding help from the United States for implementing the FARC deal and has rejected the possibility of restarting fumigation with glyphosate, something Washington has backed. Instead, Colombia favors manual eradication and crop substitution in concert with rural communities, as agreed upon in the FARC deal. The country is planning to manually eliminate 50,000 hectares of coca. Rebel groups, right-wing paramilitaries and crime gangs have all been involved in drug trafficking during Colombia’s five-decade conflict, which has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions from their homes.

124,Dan Mangan,9212017,CNBC,9142017,"Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday said the Trump administration fully supports a last-ditch Senate bill to gut and replace Obamacare — but 10 governors of both parties immediately afterward called on Senate leaders to not even consider that legislation. The dueling views came as the clock kept ticking toward to a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of the Graham-Cassidy bill, which would effectively replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, who have 52 seats in the Senate, continue to struggle to cobble together the 50 votes they need in that chamber to pass the bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday did not commit to holding a vote on the bill before the end of the month, a sign of the political difficulty it faces. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the bill's sponsors, told reporters that if Republicans passed the legislation it would ""stop a march toward socialism."" Graham warned that if the bill fails, the nation would move closer to adopting a single-payer health system of the kind called for last week by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont. ""Here's the choice for America: socialism or federalism when it comes to your health care,"" said Graham, whose bill would block grant federal funds to individual states to craft their own health coverage systems. But Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Graham-Cassidy is ""a bill to end Medicaid as we know it."" Schumer said individual Republicans are ""ashamed"" of the bill, and are trying to ram it through Congress without a traditional set of hearings and without a full analysis of its effects by the Congressional Budget Office because ""they're afraid to find out what it actually does"" to Americans. Pence said he was set to tell Republican senators at a lunch Tuesday that the House of Representatives will reject any legislation to prop up individual insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. But the 10 governors — Republicans, Democrats and an independent — called on the Senate to pass exactly that kind of insurance market stabilization legislation. A Senate committee led by Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., has been considering a series of measures to prop up Obamacare markets, including by guaranteeing the continuation of federal subsidies paid to insurance companies in exchange for discounts in customers' out-of-pocket health costs. Pence's comments came aboard Air Force Two as it flew to Washington from New York, with Graham aboard. On Monday night, Pence told a pool reporter aboard the flight that President Donald Trump called Graham to encourage him, and to say the bill must be passed by Congress. When Graham said he had gained a new appreciation for the president's tenacity, Pence quipped, ""You're learning."" Pence said he planned to tell senators Tuesday, ""This is the moment. Now is the time"" to pass an Obamacare repeal bill. Pence said he also would make clear that Obamacare is collapsing and that the House will not support any efforts to either fix or bolster that health-care law. ""We have 12 days,"" Pence added, referring to deadline for passing the Graham-Cassidy legislation under the terms of the reconciliation process being used to get the bill approved with just 50 senators voting for it. The vice president said that he and Graham have been lobbying senators on the phone to support the bill. Pence said he has even called Sen. Joe Manchin, the Democrat from West Virginia, to ask him to vote for the legislation. However, no Democrat or independent in the Senate is expected to vote for a repeal bill. The duo also has reached out to governors to ask for their support, particularly Alaska's Bill Walker, who has said he is worried about the bill leading to Medicaid cuts. The independent Walker, it turned out, was one the 10 governors who signed a letter Tuesday asking the Senate to reject Graham-Cassidy. At one point during the conversation, Pence left the cabin of the plane to speak with Trump. Graham told the pool reporter that he has struck an unlikely partnership with Steve Bannon, the recently fired Trump advisor, whom he referred to as ""Darth Vader,"" to push the health-care bill. ""I have got Alan Greenspan, Jeb Bush and Steve Bannon"" behind the bill, Graham said. ""If anyone can do better I'd like to meet them."" The letter Tuesday to McConnell and Schumer was signed by the governors of Ohio, Colorado, Montana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Louisiana, Nevada, Massachusetts and Vermont, as well as by Alaska's Walker. ""As you continue to consider changes to the American health care system, we ask you not to consider the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson amendment and renew support for bipartisan efforts to make health care more available and affordable for all Americans,"" the letter said. ""Only open, bipartisan approaches can achieve true, lasting reforms,"" the governors wrote. ""We ask you to support bipartisan efforts to bring stability and affordability to our insurance markets. Legislation should receive consideration under regular order, including hearings in health committees and input from the appropriate health-related parties."" ""Improvements to our health insurance markets should control costs, stabilize the market, and positively impact coverage and care of millions of Americans, including many who are dealing with mental illness, chronic health problems, and drug addiction."" Schumer, in his own remarks to reporters Tuesday, blasted Graham's bill, which he called even more ""dangerous"" than prior Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. Schumer said if Graham-Cassidy becomes law ""millions will lose coverage,"" there will be no guarantees of affordable coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions, and would cripple Medicaid. Earlier Tuesday, the American Medical Association and the National Council for Behavioral Health joined a host of other health-care groups that have announced their opposition to the bill. ""We believe the Graham-Cassidy Amendment would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance coverage, destabilize health insurance markets, and decrease access to affordable coverage and care,"" wrote AMA Executive Vice President and CEO Dr. James L. Madara in a letter to Senate leaders. ""We sincerely urge the Senate to take short-term measures to stabilize the health insurance market."" In a letter to all senators on Tuesday, AARP, the leading lobbying group for older Americans, said it opposed the bill ""on behalf of our nearly 38 million members"" because it would not help make premiums more affordable, lower out-of-pocket costs, and offer coverage they can count on. ""Overall, the Graham/Cassidy/Heller/Johnson bill would increase health care costs for older Americans with an age tax, decrease coverage, and undermine preexisting condition protections,"" the group wrote. ""In addition, this bill would jeopardize the ability of older Americans and people with disabilities to stay in their own homes as they age and threaten coverage for individuals in nursing homes.""

I appreciate it. And I'm greatly honored to host this lunch, to be joined by the leaders of Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Nambia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and South Africa. In particular, I want to thank President Condé, who is representing the African Union. Thank you. Thank you. In this room, I see partners for promoting prosperity and peace on a range of economic, humanitarian, and security issues. We hope to extend our economic partnerships with countries who are committed to self-reliance and to fostering opportunities for job creation in both Africa and the United States. Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. I congratulate you. They're spending a lot of money. But it does — it has a tremendous business potential and representing huge amounts of different markets. And for American firms it's really become a place that they have to go — that they want to go. Six of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Increasing American trade and investment across diverse industries — including agriculture, energy, transportation, health care, travel, and tourism — will further transform lives throughout the continent. Secretary Tillerson and the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation are already considering an investment worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Côte d’Ivoire, which has made impressive economic reforms. Really, you've done a tremendous job. We also hope that African firms — like the company Sasol — consider making investments in the United States. Sasol, as an example, is building a $9 billion petrochemical plant in Louisiana, which will bring new jobs to the state and, really, hard-working Americans will be manning those jobs. But we cannot have prosperity if we're not healthy. We will continue our partnership on critical health initiatives. Uganda has made incredible strides in the battle against HIV/AIDS. In Guinea and Nigeria, you fought a horrifying Ebola outbreak. Nambia’s health system is increasingly self-sufficient. My Secretary of Health and Human Services will be traveling to Africa to promote our Global Health Security Agenda. Yet, we know that our prosperity depends, above all, on peace. The United States will partner with the countries and organizations, like the African Union, that lead successful efforts to end violence, to prevent the spread of terrorism, and to respond to humanitarian crises. I commend your troops currently serving in the field. Very brave. Very, very brave what they’re going through. As you well know, too many people are suffering from conflict in Africa. In the Central African Republic, the Congo, Libya, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan, among others, they’re going through some very, very tough and very dangerous times. Terrorist groups, such as ISIS, al-Shabab, Boko Haram, and al-Qaeda also threaten African peace. The United States is proud to work with you to eradicate terrorist safe havens, to cut off their finances, and to discredit their depraved ideology. And a number of you have told me — actually, last night — that we’ve been doing a very good job over the last six or seven months in particular. We're closely monitoring and deeply disturbed by the ongoing violence in South Sudan and in the Congo. Millions of lives are at risk, and we continue to provide humanitarian assistance. But real results in halting this catastrophe will require an African-led peace process and a sincere — really sincere commitment of all parties involved. And I know you’re working on that, and you’re working on that very hard. To assist in these efforts, I'm sending Ambassador Nikki Haley to Africa to discuss avenues of conflict and resolution and, most importantly, prevention. Lastly, I want to discuss our partnership against a global challenge. Today, the world faces an enormous security threat from North Korean regime. We must all stand together and be accountable in implementing United Nations sanctions and resolutions in response to North Korea’s hostile and menacing actions. We believe that a free, independent, and democratic nation, in all cases, is the best vehicle for human happiness and success. Thank you for joining me for this critical discussion of the challenges and the opportunities facing our nations. Africa, I have to say, is a continent of tremendous, tremendous potential. The outlook is bright. I look forward to hearing from you and your advice during the meal. I thought rather than just eating, we’ll have long discussions — and I look forward to that very much. But I also look forward to getting to know so many of you, and so many of you I do know. And it’s an honor. It’s an honor. And I really want to congratulate you — growing very fast economically and in every other way. You’ve done a terrific job, you’ve had some tremendous obstacles placed in your path, but you have done, really, an absolutely incredible job. So I want to thank you, and I look forward to our discussion. Thank you. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) ","Trump's puzzling speech to African leaders, annotated - The Washington Post",0.9961

I congratulate you. They're spending a lot of money."" Trump delivered the remark at a luncheon he hosted with the leaders of many of the 54 diverse nations on the African continent. And while Trump almost certainly meant it as compliment, and even seemed to pause for applause, not one attendee clapped. For centuries, Europeans and Americans have exploited Africa's natural resources and labor force, not least during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In the post-Colonial era, the U.S. government has supported dozens of authoritarian regimes on the African continent, while American companies have made billions of dollars from deals with dictatorships. Since taking office in January, Trump has nominated ambassadors to only around a dozen African nations, despite having recalled all Obama-era ambassadors before he was inaugurated. This means that the vast majority of nations on the continent do not currently have a U.S. ambassador with whom they can conduct bilateral diplomacy. During the same speech, Trump also mispronounced Namibia as ""Nambia,"" saying very clearly that ""Nambia's health system is increasingly self-sufficient."" A White House transcript confirmed that Trump meant to say Namibia. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

127,Christina Farr,9212017,CNBC,9142017,"Karl Kaufmann, an emergency room physician at Washington's Valley Medical Center, spends a lot of time at the end of a shift doing administrative work, like typing words and checking boxes into electronic medical records. But recently, he's been testing out a virtual medical scribe called SayKara. SayKara was developed by a group of former employees from companies like speech recognition giant Nuance and Amazon. The team is based in Seattle and is launching this week after several years quietly developing the technology and securing a $2.5 million seed round from local investment firm Madrona Venture Group. ""I use SayKara in two ways, both to recap a patient visit and to incorporate the pertinent details of a patient interaction into the medical record,"" said Kaufmann. Similarly to Amazon Alexa, SayKara starts working when a physician says a hot word, like ""OK Kara"" or taps on the app that runs on iOS devices, including iPhone and iPad. Kaufmann was one of the first to try out SayKara, which aims to be an alternative to human scribes and existing dictation tools like Nuance's Dragon. The goal is to accurately transcribe audio to text, parse the information to make it structured, and insert it cleanly into an electronic health record. Voice is rapidly becoming big business in health care, as medical systems look for new ways to help doctors focus on the patient interaction, rather than the computer. Studies have shown that doctors today spend about a quarter of their time on the patient visit, with nearly half on desk work and charting in the electronic health record. As a result, hospitals are already tinkering with Amazon's voice technology Alexa. And businesses like Augmedix are leveraging Google's Glass hardware to offer electronic health record support with a remote scribe. But SayKara says it's taking a different approach. Unlike Amazon, it is narrowly focused on the health-care space. And unlike more established competitors like Augmedix, it doesn't rely on human transcribers, which are expensive and take months to train. SayKara CEO Harjinder Sandhu says the first inspiration for the technology was Amazon Alexa, but that the team realized early on it needed to focus on the needs of the medical sector to get it right. In order to sell to hospitals, SayKara needs to meet compliance, security and privacy requirements, and ensure that it doesn't make seemingly small mistakes that can actually have an enormous effect (a difference is ""hypo"" versus ""hyper""). ""The hurdles in health care are very high,"" admits Sandhu. But Sandhu believes that the current technology is good enough for physicians to use. ""We're taking the state of the art in speech recognition and machine learning and we're applying it,"" he explained. ""The key is to couple it with deep knowledge of how physicians work and the information that is relevant to them."" The company hasn't figured out a price yet, but Sandhu maintains that it cost a fraction of a human scribe. Ralph Pascualy, former CEO of Swedish Medical Group, is one of the first to sign up to use the tool. In his view, so much of his doctors' time is wasted in medical records that any company that can eat ""even halfway into the problem"" is worth the cost. He also appreciates SayKara's approach in not claiming to replace doctors, but to help them with specific challenges. ""Unlike some AI tools, this company isn't attempting to boil the ocean,"" he said. ""I think physicians will be more comfortable with that."" ",SayKara building Amazon Alexa for health care,0.9892
128, ,9212017,CNBC,9142017,"The long-term battle on trade between the U.S. and China shows no sign of ending as a war of words ensued this week between the two. First, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called China an ""unprecedented"" threat, because of the ""sheer scale of their coordinated efforts to develop their economy, to subsidize, to create national champions, to force technology transfer and to distort markets."" Then China countered, repeating its long-held stance that the bilateral relationship is good for both sides. ""The nature of China-U.S. trade relations is mutually beneficial,"" said Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry. ""China and the U.S. should work together to uphold authority of the WTO rules."" China refuses to be ruffled by what the U.S. has to say, as Beijing is more keen than ever to maintain stability ahead of a major leadership shuffle in a few weeks' time. But the U.S. doesn't look like it plans to simmer down anytime soon, especially as President Donald Trump is expected to visit China later this year and the two sides prepare to sit down at the negotiating table. The trade deficit between the world's two largest economies is in excess of $300 billion a year, something many critics have pointed to as evidence of an unbalanced relationship. China, meanwhile, counters that ""many U.S. products are not favored by Chinese,"" according to an editorial in state media Global Times. ""But China still imports them for its trade balance. Some terribly produced Hollywood movies have profited handsomely on the Chinese market."" It's a tricky line to toe for Beijing — middle-class Chinese consumers have clamored for foreign products in the wake of many food and health safety scares over the years. And the government restricts the number of foreign films that can be released in China each year. But never mind all that: Clearly, the message China wants to send is that it's not a one-sided relationship. ""Washington doesn't need to act as if it has been taken for a ride,"" wrote the nationalistic Global Times. The official media goes on to point that China bought U.S. Treasury bonds for the sixth straight month in July, becoming again the largest holder of U.S. debt, which it says is ""the epitome of mutually beneficial trade relations."" It also said Lighthizer's comment that China unfairly subsidizes companies to create national champions was ironic in light of Trump's ""America First"" campaign. Still, the Trump administration continues to pressure China. A few weeks ago, the U.S. launched an investigation into Chinese intellectual property theft under ""Section 301"" of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, a tactic that is rarely used and could see the U.S. take retaliatory action within a year.

But when a breast cancer diagnosis at 59 left this once ebullient woman ""severely clinically depressed"" — her words — she turned to an unusual research project for help. In 2016, Ingenito became one of 18 subjects in the first-ever FDA-cleared study to explore the therapeutic effects of MDMA — commonly known as ecstasy — on people with life-threatening illnesses who are suffering from depression. After four standard (i.e., sober) therapy sessions with the two psychologists leading the study, Ingenito embarked on three ""medicine journeys,"" as she calls them: marathon eight-hour therapy sessions fueled by capsules of MDMA. ""Incredible"" is how she describes the experience now. ""From the very first moment that I felt the medicine in my body, it radically transformed all the trauma that I had been holding, not only from the diagnosis but previously from my life as well. My anxiety is gone; the depression is gone; my life force is back."" Today she is free from both cancer and depression. Depression now affects 16 million Americans and 350 million adults worldwide, according to the NIMH, making it one of the most common disabilities in the world. But even with more than 20 antidepressants approved by the FDA over the past 60 years, many people still struggle with the condition: One-third of Americans simply don't respond to any of the currently available medicines, studies say, and there hasn't been a significant breakthrough in decades. As the years of desperation mount, doctors are finding themselves turning to new and unexpected sources for the next big antidepression drug. Though there is no shortage of antidepression drugs currently available, analysts believe there is still plenty of opportunity in the nearly $17 billion global market. The notion that a ""party drug"" like MDMA could be used for more than recreation may have been out of fashion for many years, but it's not a new idea. Before it was outlawed in the 1960s, LSD showed promise as a treatment for depression and alcoholism. Dr. Phillip Wolfson, an author of Ingenito's study, was one of several mental health professionals experimenting with MDMA as a therapy aid in the early 1980s before it was outlawed. But a combination of prohibition and social stigma rendered it nearly impossible to get government permission, much less funding, to perform any sort of research with such drugs. Now a handful of studies — and the persistent researchers behind them — are pointing to a future where drugs like LSD, MDMA, ketamine and psilocybin (the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms) could find a second life not just as therapeutic aids but as potential blockbusters.

Insurers, doctors battle over new heart disease drugs ""MDMA has a blockbuster aspect in many, many areas,"" said Dr. Wolfson in a telephone interview. ""It could be used for PTSD, depression, couples' work, relationship work and probably OCD."" The evidence, he claims, is in the studies now being published. Though results of Ingenito's study are still being analyzed, preliminary data suggests the MDMA sessions dramatically alleviated depression in the subjects. That follows an earlier study that tested MDMA as a treatment for PTSD in which 80 percent of subjects no longer suffered from the condition after just two sessions. Early studies with psilocybin have been similarly encouraging. In a 2016 NYU study looking at whether the drug could alleviate anxiety and depression in cancer patients, more than 80 percent of subjects reported significant improvements. A smaller  2012 study yielded similar results. Ketamine — which goes by the street name Special K — has been studied more than most illicit drugs, thanks to its legal status in the United States as a tranquilizer (usually for animals). And results have been so encouraging that both Allergen and Johnson & Johnson currently have ketamine-inspired antidepressants in late-stage clinical trials. Of course, ketamine and MDMA are powerful drugs with serious side effects that would need to be managed. Ketamine's paralyzing effect can be so powerful, it's often classified as a date-rape drug, and users sometimes asphyxiate because they can't clear their own airwaves. MDMA can induce symptoms resembling a panic attack — sweating, nausea, chills, involuntary teeth clenching — and is occasionally associated with heat stroke.  Due to the risks, there is a clinical study under way at Stanford University to test if ketamine acts like an opioid. Promising as the research on some illicit drugs is, scientists caution that many of these treatments are still years away from commercial availability, and the testing itself is, in many cases, still in its infancy. For example, a team of researchers in the U.K. last year became the first ever to produce images of the human brain on LSD — a remarkable fact, considering how widely the drug has been consumed over the past 50 years. But the obstacles to working with the drug were simply too great, said Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College and an author of the study. ""The illegal status of LSD meant that researchers were scared, and the costs of complying with the regulations were prohibitive, and governments wouldn't fund the research because the drugs were illegal."" Still, the results of the scans strongly suggested that LSD could help treat depression in much the way psilocybin does. ""It switches off regions of the brain that are overactive in depression,"" Nutt said. It also disrupts communication between certain sections of the brain, producing an ""ego dissolution"" that helps users feel more connected to the world around them. Such results are going a long way toward easing the path for researchers who want to explore these drugs. As is the existence of groups like MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), which has helped secure private funding for much of the research on these drugs — a notoriously difficult endeavor given the stigma surrounding them. Of course, MAPS is not the first group to advocate for the legal use of psychedelics. And hopes of a breakthrough in the area seem to arise every decade or so, suggesting the path to FDA approval may still be a long, arduous one. But Dr. Wolfson, who has watched the enthusiasm for researching psychedelic drugs rise and fall over the decades, says he's never seen the surge of interest like he is seeing now. ""Interest is peaking,"" said Dr. Wolfson, but ""it hasn't peaked yet.""

131,"Andrew Zaleski, special to CNBC.com",9212017,CNBC,9142017,"Gary Foster was in his 50s when his eyesight started to fail. The native Canadian eventually lost all central vision in both his eyes a few years ago as a result of age-related macular degeneration. Place a peanut on a table, and Foster won't be able to see it; if he turns slightly and uses his peripheral vision, he might catch a glimpse of it. He can't see people's faces or read text on a page. After he lost his central vision, he lost his license. After he lost his license, he lost his job, since it required him to drive. ""There is no cure. All I ever heard from the doctor is, 'Sorry, there is nothing we can do for you,'"" said Foster, now 63. But several years ago Foster happened upon a piece of technology at a public exhibition in Calgary. It was a pair of glasses called eSight, and when he put them on, he realized that his vision drastically improved, so much so that he could see faces and read books. ""When I first put it on, I was able to read to the bottom of the eye chart,"" Foster said. Foster is not the only visually impaired person turning to new technologies to either improve vision or assist with everyday tasks. A growing cohort of companies, like eSight, offer visual tools that can enhance vision — making things bigger, brighter and bolder so that they're able to be visible to people like Foster. Other companies, like San Diego-based Aira, connect people to real-time support services that — thanks to devices such as Google Glass — can see what the blind can't and navigate users interacting with, for example, a vending machine by talking to them over the phone. Founded in 2006 by Conrad Lewis, a computer engineer with two legally blind sisters, Toronto-based eSight developed its own pair of proprietary glasses, backed by a decade of in-house research. The company keeps many specifics under wraps. According to communications director Jeffrey Fenton, eSight is ""backed by tens of millions of dollars,"" and there are ""thousands of stories that showcase"" people using eSight. The company released its latest pair of glasses, eSight3, last February. The glasses, which look like a visorlike headset, are rechargeable and good for eight hours on a single charge. Each houses a high-speed, high-definition camera that captures what the user is looking at. The device uses algorithms to enhance the video feed and displays the video through eSight's OLED screens in front of the user's eyes. Almost immediately, the cameras enhance the footage that beams across two screens, one in front of each eye. A 24-times zoom also helps out. The wearable headset has Wi-Fi and HDMI capabilities to stream digital content, and it can send pictures and videos. Each person who wears the glasses are able to control color, contrast and magnification. The result is that many people who use the eSight3 today are able to read books and street signs, see objects from far away and know what their friends' and relatives' faces actually look like. More from Modern Medicine:It sounds futuristic, but it's not sci-fi: Human organs-on-a-chip Glasses like the eSight3 are good for people suffering from any one of about a dozen eye conditions, among them Stargardt disease, optic atrophy, macular degeneration and some forms of glaucoma. According to the National Federation of the Blind, roughly 10 million Americans are blind or visually impaired, and about 1.3 million of that number are legally blind, defined as central vision acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye. ""It works for the overwhelming majority of the legally blind,"" Fenton said, who added that its oldest user is 97. The youngest user: four years old. The main problem with technology like eSight is the cost. ""There's still a major group of people out there who want but cannot afford the technology,"" Fenton said. Foster purchased his own eSight glasses for $15,000 out of pocket. The eSight 3, the new version of glasses, costs less, with a price tag of $9,995. Paying for this kind of technology when you're blind can be difficult, as the costs are often not covered by health insurance. ""The technology becoming available is phenomenal, and most people won't be able to get their hands on it,"" said Mindy Jacobsen, first vice president of the National Federation of the Blind of New York. Each year, the overall tally of low-vision or blind people in the United States increases by 75,000, according to the NFB. But 70 percent of working-age blind adults are unemployed. Medicare and health insurance companies determine whether eyesight technology is going to be reimbursable or covered at all. Historically, most insurance companies have seen glasses as something different from the correction of a medical problem, according to Melissa Chun, director of the Vision Rehabilitation Center at the Los Angeles-based Stein Eye Institute. For example, prosthetics technology for a person with a missing limb is classified as durable medical equipment and is therefore covered by insurance. Vision-assisted equipment, almost universally, are classified as glasses, which are not covered by insurance. ""This technology is wearable tech and video magnification, really, a whole different route for people with low vision. And it's really more appropriate to call it vision-assisted equipment rather than anything else,"" Chun said. ""It can be perceived as a form of discrimination, actually, if [insurance companies] don't cover vision-assisted equipment."" The one-time cost of equipment like eSight contrasts with other pricing models. Aira, founded in 2015 with $15 million in venture capital from firms including New York City's Lux Capital, employs 70 agents throughout the United States who are available daily from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. EST who provide over-the-phone instructions to people with low vision or blind vision. Aira users pay for one of four monthly plans and then receive a pair of Google Glasses and an AT&T data plan. ""Users connect to an agent using the phone, and when they connect to the agent, they can yield the camera to the agent,"" said Suman Kanuganti, CEO and co-founder of Aira. ""Our agent is literally living in the world of the blind person whenever a call is coming in."" But a basic plan through Aira costs $89 per month and only gets a user 100 minutes to speak to someone over the phone. So far, Aira counts thousands of users and 3,800 hours of service over the last six months, Kanuganti said. He added that navigation comprises only 20 percent of all calls. ""Users cook; they go to museums to get descriptions of the artwork. Someone read a children's book to a daughter. Someone went to his father's funeral using Aira,"" he said. The NFB's Jacobsen demonstrated using Aira in a recent video produced by CNBC. Again, the main problem with Aira for many users is the cost. The Aira plan with unlimited minutes costs $329 per month. For someone who can only afford the basic, $89 package, they have to judiciously use the 100 minutes they receive every month. Bringing the cost down of making products for those with vision impairments is going to be a matter of scale, Kanuganti said. Companies like eSight, on the other hand, think it's up to large organizations — companies and the government — to be willing to employ people with vision impairments and pay for eyesight technology. ""We continue to believe that society could and should provide this to the blind at low or no cost,"" Fenton said. His company has a financial stake in the matter, but it does put its money where its mouth is: About 20 percent of eSight's own workforce of 100 are legally blind. Foster is one of those employees. He's been working at eSight for the last couple of years, demonstrating the technology at various events throughout Canada. Before he lost his central vision, he was a highways supervisor for Parks Canada in charge of coordinating jobs like snow removal and clearing major accidents from roadways that pass by the Yoho and Banff national parks in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, respectively. He lost that job when he lost his vision, since it meant he could no longer drive. While he's still not licensed to drive, Foster said the glasses effectively restore his central vision. He's now able to travel on his own, without his wife's help, and take part in his main hobby of carpentry. ""My wife has normal vision, and she doesn't even try to read prescription bottles anymore. She just hands them to me,"" Foster said. ""It just made me completely independent again.""

132,"Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com",9212017,CNBC,9142017,"While President Trump lays out a foreign policy agenda based on nationalism and ""America First"" principles, his daughter Ivanka has taken a different worldview. Three months ago Ivanka Trump stood next to her father and other world leaders at the G20, announcing a plan to bring $1 billion to help women entrepreneurs in emerging markets. The media and the development world scorned, calling it a naked bid for good press and an attempt by world leaders, especially those in Saudi Arabia, to curry favor with the American president through his daughter's pet project. The World Bank quickly downplayed Ivanka's role, and it's unclear how involved she remains. After Ivanka met with Arab women entrepreneurs, money from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seeded the initiative. But the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative — or We-Fi, as it's called — has spread, with about a dozen other countries, donating a total of $325 million to the financing facility that launched on October 12 to provide funding to women-owned enterprises. But now We-Fi is emerging as an innovative attempt to spur private investment in women's enterprises in countries around the world. There are already signs that insurance companies, venture capitalists and private equity funds are looking more seriously at investing and designing products with an emphasis on including women. The new managing partner at the Abraaj Group's $1.6 billion impact investment arm, Kito de Boer, for instance, said it is considering launching a fund focused on diversity. Ivanka's goals seem to contradict President Trump's. In March he said he wants to cut off the spigot that has helped fund many micro ventures around the world: a little-noticed federal agency called OPIC that is a backstop lender for community banks in developing countries. ""This World Bank fund is very important because it cuts through the politics and diplomacy,"" said Sofana Dahlan, a Saudi lawyer, entrepreneur and government official who met with Ivanka in Saudi Arabia. ""A lot of countries do refrain from helping Saudi women, because they don't want to be politically incorrect."" Ivanka, Dahlan said, may have seized a rare moment when the Saudi government was open to change. ""Saudi Arabia welcomed the idea. It's very important to act on it right away."" We-Fi — which appears to have rapidly folded in some ideas that the World Bank has been studying and experimenting with for the past five years — is different from other financing initiatives for women. While most programs for women have focused on grants and low-interest loans, We-Fi is making the money available for equity investments — meaning venture capital and private equity funds will be able to tap into it — and insurance products. That may give big insurers an incentive to develop products for women in emerging markets. There are only about 60 funds worldwide with a specific focus on investing in women entrepreneurs, based on her research, said Suzanne Biegel, senior gender lens investing adviser at the Wharton Social Impact Initiative, part of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. They have a combined $1.3 billion. An additional $500 million to $600 million is sought collectively by the funds. Against this universe, ""for women entrepreneurs, $1 billion is a huge number,"" she said. More from iCONIC:7 lessons from Elon Musk's first, forgotten small-business success A report from the World Bank, financial services giant Axa and consultancy Accenture found the market for insurance for women, including women entrepreneurs, in 10 emerging markets that it studied would be $1.7 trillion by 2030, up from $800 billion in 2013. Money from We-Fi, which will be distributed through development banks that likely will award the money based on project applications, could conceivably be used in projects like developing insurance products aimed at women entrepreneurs, or to loan money to women-led brokerages. The first calls for proposals will be out in October, according to the World Bank. ""I'm sitting in Tanzania talking to 19 entrepreneurs about scaling up,"" said Biegel. ""Insurance is a huge need. They can't get crop insurance or greenhouse insurance. Without insurance, you are vulnerable."" We-Fi will make the $325 million pledged by donor countries available for equity deals where partners include venture capitalists and private equity funds. That means the World Bank could be an investor in funds that invest in women-led start-ups, or the start-ups themselves, in emerging tech hubs, like Dubai or Nairobi's ""Silicon Savannah."" The presence of World Bank money in a deal often reassures co-investors from the United States or Europe and gives funds working in geographies or with populations that investors see as risky a longer time frame. World Bank investments in funds in the Middle East and North Africa has helped launch several venture capital funds there. The We-Fi money may push more funds to focus on women. For instance, a $150 million Cairo-based fund, Ripples Impact, aims to launch in the second quarter of 2018 to invest in growth-stage companies in the Middle East and North Africa working in health and food security, with women's empowerment one of its guiding investment principles. If women participated equally with men around the world, $12 trillion would be added to the global economy, consulting firm McKinsey estimated in 2015. Funding women entrepreneurs, especially in traditionally male-dominated industries, is seen as one of the best ways to spur greater equality. The White House did not respond to questions about Ivanka's continuing role in the We-Fi initiative, though she was involved over the summer, meeting with investment and entrepreneurship experts and hosting meetings at the White House. She is leading the U.S. delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, India. The annual summit is an Obama initiative. Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, an advocate for women and a philanthropist, investor and the founder of several luxury lifestyle companies, will become an advisor to the fund. Part of the vitriol directed against Ivanka came from her lack of experience in global entrepreneurship, as well as her father's stated intention to dismantle global financial infrastructure. Her clothing line has come under fire for not monitoring the treatment of factory workers to which it outsources.  ""She has got zero credibility when it comes to global women's entrepreneurship, much less financing entrepreneurship,"" said one expert. It is a deeply complicated issue, one that has so far defied most solutions. ""If we are trying to change patterns of capital distribution, we should be bold and purposeful and choose areas that will demonstrate what's possible,"" said Laurie Spengler, CEO of Washington, D.C.-based Enclude, which advises businesses and financial institutions on how they can serve underserved entrepreneurs. ""With $1 billion, you're trying to lead others."" Take Kenya, for instance. It is a financial center, and, as home to a flourishing mobile money ecosystem based on MPesa, an emerging tech capital. But women there still face a long road to working or founding businesses in traditionally male-dominated sectors. On a recent Thursday, about 20 articulate, confident 7th-grade girls at a school in Kibera run by the nonprofit Shining Hope for Communities, sat around a table describing their aspirations. Most wanted to be teachers and doctors. One or two mentioned business. One girl, Susan, spoke up and said firmly: ""I want to be a banker."" Despite the top-notch education at the school, the odds are still stacked high against Susan if she wants to work in finance in Kenya. ""It's hard to convince a male CEO of a bank to listen to you,"" said Peris Bosire, co-founder of a Nairobi-based company called Farm Drive that enables small farmers to keep track of their revenue and expenses and apply for loans. As the company gathers more data on repayment rates, she hopes to be able to convince more banks to take a risk on Farm Drive and the farmers it works with, and to find investors to back the company. ""Most investors and the people you're trying to do business with, they have subconscious bias against us. They think of us, 'OK, the two young girls' and not in a nice way."" Women provide 80 percent of Kenya's farm labor and manage 40 percent of the country's smallholder farms, yet they own only roughly 1 percent of agricultural land and receive just 10 percent of available credit, USAID reported in 2015. While funding for start-up tech businesses is beginning, one of the gaps for women's enterprise in emerging markets is growth capital for traditional businesses, said Spengler. Two she has worked with in Karachi are a pest-control company and Al-Karam Packaages, which makes plastic bags. Founded by a divorced mother, Mussarat Ishaq, who worked days as a babysitter and cleaner while she learned the business, it now has 250 employees. Now, she wants to move into environment-friendly packaging materials. Banks in Pakistan often don't approve such loans: convincing them to do so involves analyzing new market segments perceived as ""too risky"" for banks; developing the right bank products and services; training loan officers in cash-flow based lending and demonstrating he positive P&L results that come from investing in underserved segments, Spengler said. Few banks in emerging markets are willing to make the investment, so some programs to support women entrepreneurs offer banks low-interest capital. The supply of capital for ambitious women entrepreneurs falls far short of the demand. In India, for instance, the World Bank estimated $30 billion in working and fixed capital requirements for women entrepreneurs in India. The supply from banks and other formal sources is estimated at less than $9 billion. It is not money alone that enables women entrepreneurs to grow. Saudi Arabia has set aside a budget of $180 million to promote entrepreneurship in its economy, and women are meant to be part of that group. But the reality is far different. Initiatives need to be carefully calibrated not to run afoul of culture to succeed. Women are entering the tech sector in higher numbers, possibly because it is a new part of the economy. Dahlan's company helps creative people, like graphic designers, start businesses. She is also cautious, as she talks to women, to tell them they can become entrepreneurs after their children go to school. ""We need to look at building sectors in Saudi Arabia where women can easily operate and take matters into their own hands and open their own ventures,"" she said. She stays inspired, she said, by something her grandmother told her: ""The footsteps of a woman with coins in her pocket has a different sound."" ""I can only have a voice if I am financially independent. Nobody can tell me if I can fly or not, because I pay my own ticket,"" she said.

That marked the highest total in history, besting the previous all-time high of 897.9 million passengers set the year prior. Expectations for 2017 are that we could wind up setting a new traffic record yet again. This added traffic is a bit of a double-edged sword for the airline industry. While the boost in travel demonstrates that demand from consumers is healthy, it's also increased the voracity of competition among the airline industry. This competition, especially fare-price wars, has been weighing on margins for the industry as a whole. Lower fares may not be good news for airline margins, but it tends to make the consumer pretty darn happy. Image source: Getty Images. You know what else makes passengers happy? Perks. A number of airlines have been bringing back ""extras"" or emphasizing existing perks to win customers over. Examples include a few of the majors bringing back complimentary meals on long domestic flights, or in rarer cases the opportunity to bring one or two bags of luggage onboard for free. But passengers want more than just a free meal or a free checked bag. If they're going to stick with an airline for the long haul, they want to feel appreciated and get rewarded for their loyalty. That's where an airline's elite status comes into play. We're talking here about what perks a passenger is offered for flying a certain amount of miles, or spending a specific amount of money, with an airline in a given year. The better the perks, the assumption would be the more likely a consumer is likely to choose one airline over another. And loyalty can be a very important profit driver in the airline industry, especially if loyal customers prove to be less reliant on sales when making their purchases. So which airlines have the best elite status perks? To answer this question, we'll turn to a brand-new report from ThePointsGuy.com, which examined six national airlines: Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and United Continental (NYSE:UAL). What happened to Frontier, Hawaiian, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country, and Virgin America, you ask? Frontier, Hawaiian, Spirit, and Sun Country were excluded because they're regional carriers with limited elite status perks outside their hubs, while Virgin America is currently merging with Alaska Air and is already included in its results. Image source: Getty Images. The report examined these six national airlines across eight broad categories, each with a percentage weighting of importance: Lastly, the analysis looked at four separate categories of elite status: The performance of the six airlines was averaged across all four tiers, so a first-to-worst list with regard to elite status could be assembled. Let's look at the results. Image source: Alaska Air. Alaska's outperformance is perhaps the highest in the mid-tier elite category, where MVP Gold members earn a 100% bonus on the miles they fly, which for 50,000 miles translates to about $950. The other major carriers offer three miles per dollar spent, or about 18,000 miles total. MVP Gold members are also privy to fee waivers, which comes in handy for those last-minute flight changes since it won't result in extra fees. Not surprisingly, J.D. Power in May announced that Alaska had earned the highest ranking in terms of customer satisfaction among traditional airlines for the 10th consecutive year. With perks like these, it's no wonder its passengers are happy and Alaska's business is excelling. Image source: Getty Images. United Airlines, the second best performer based on elite status, finished a respective, fourth, second, third, and first in the low-, mid-, high-, and road-warrior-tiers. Whereas Alaska was top dog for casual to regular fliers, United Airlines appears to be the preferred choice for those who are seemingly always flying the friendly skies. Interestingly enough, the analysis shows that there's nothing specific about the United Premier 1K status (for those with 100,000 miles flown and $12,000 in spending) that sets it apart from the competition other than it finishing consistently in the top three in seven of the eight categories examined. Perks include enhanced award availability in economy and premium cabins, complimentary drinks and snacks, and a total of six regional premier upgrades and six global premier upgrades. Another perk offered to United customers is its RewardPlus partnership with Marriott, which allows automatic reciprocal status between both companies. This crossover perk platform helps really boost United's non-flying perks. Image source: Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines came in third overall with consistent respective finishes of third, third, second, and third across the low-, mid-, high-, and road-warrior-tiers. For Delta, its in-flight perks and flexible perks appear to be the lure it'll be using to attract passengers. For example, in the high-tier category Delta offers a longer upgrade window of 120 hours (compared with United at 72 hours), complimentary access to preferred seats, and extra-legroom economy seats. Similar to United, Delta also offers a crossover rewards partnership with Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG). While ThePointsGuy.com finds that the United partnership with Marriott is tops on the list, Delta's crossover rewards with SPG come in a close second. The bottom half of the rankings consisted of American Airlines in fourth, JetBlue in fifth, and Southwest Airlines, which J.D. Power found ranked highest in customer satisfaction among low-cost carriers for the first time in 2017, ranked dead last. Certainly an odd position for Southwest to be in considering its financial success. Image source: JetBlue Airways. Why did these airlines rank so poorly on elite status relative to the aforementioned three? To begin with, in the low-tier category neither JetBlue nor Southwest offers perks. You'll have to reach mid-tier status just to receive perks from either airline -- though the report notes that even there JetBlue and Southwest lag the other major airlines. At the mid-tier level, neither company offers a first class or premium upgrade for elite members, and you'll receive no benefits based on your status when flying with partner airlines. As for American Airlines, it does offer a few welcome perks, such as priority security to low-tier elite status fliers, and waiving same-day stand-by fees. However, high-tier elite members are restricted to two free checked bags weighing less than 50 pounds each, while United and Delta offer high-tier elites three free bags with each allowed to weigh up to 70 pounds. An overweight bag on American can set you back up to $200, the steepest penalty in the industry. The question is: Are elite status perks the end-all deciding factor for passengers? To that end I'd suggest it's still debatable. Take the aforementioned J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction survey into account. Southwest and JetBlue's scores of 807 and 803 were respectively higher than Alaska at 765, and well above the remaining legacy airlines. Yet as the analysis from ThePointsGuy.com shows, JetBlue and Southwest brought up the caboose in elite status perks. This suggests it's quite possible that customer satisfaction is still derived primarily by cost savings via lower fares than perks derived from loyalty, although the two sort of go hand in hand. If this is indeed the case, then low-cost carriers like Southwest and JetBlue have little to worry about and probably won't spend too much time trying to compete with legacy carriers on elite status perks anytime soon. What matters more to you: a low fare, or being rewarded for your loyalty? ","

Investors in Nabriva Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NBRV) are having a wonderful start to the trading week. Shares of the clinical-stage biotech focused on antibiotics rose 36% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT on Monday in response to reporting encouraging data from its phase 3 LEAP 1 trial. The LEAP 1 trial was designed to study the safety and efficacy of the company's lead compound lefamulin in treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). CABP is leading cause of death from infection in the United States and is a very serious public health issue. Top-line data from the 551 patient trial showed that lefamulin was able to meet the FDA's and European Medicines Agencies primary endpoints of non-inferiority when compared to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid. Specifically, the early clinical response rate assessed for lefamulin was 87.3%, while moxifloxacin's rate was 90.2%. What's more, lefamulin's safety data was also comparable to moxifloxacin. Dr. Colin Broom, Nabriva's CEO, offered investors the following commentary on the trial: ""These Phase 3 data provide strong evidence of the potential of lefamulin to treat adults with CABP and provide an alternative to a current gold standard treatment regimen. Due to lefamulin's flexible dosing and targeted spectrum of activity against the pathogens most commonly associated with CABP, including multidrug-resistant strains, we believe that lefamulin is well suited to be a first-line empiric monotherapy."" Given the clinical results, it is easy to understand why traders are bidding up shares on Monday. Image source: Getty Images. CABP is responsible for more than 3 million hospitalizations each year in the U.S. and has a mortality rate of more than 5%. What's more, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is exacerbating the need for new and improved treatment options. These facts suggest that lefamulin could quickly become a top seller if it manages to cross the finish line. However, investors should remember that Nabriva is far from the only company with a dog in this race. Paratek Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PRTK) is another clinical-stage biotech that is focused on next-generation antibiotics, and just a few months ago the company reported encouraging top-line results from a phase 3 study evaluating its investigational drug omadacycline as a treatment for CABP. The company also reported that it plans to have the drug in regulators hands in early 2018. That represents a faster timeline than Nabriva is currently on with lefamulin so the company's investors should watch omadacycline's progress closely. Nabriva is moving forward with its LEAP 2 trial, which is the company's second pivotal phase 3 study comparing oral lefamulin to moxifloxacin. Enrollment is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year and top-line data should be available in early 2018. Potential investors might want to wait until data from the LEAP 2 trial becomes available before they decide whether or not to jump in. ","

137,Sean Williams,9212017,Fool,9142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Few industries have been able to put up growth numbers like the legal marijuana industry over the past couple of years. Though estimates vary, most analysts estimate the legal weed industry can grow by 25% to 35% annually between 2016 and 2021. GreenWave Advisors is calling for perhaps the highest growth rate, with $30 billion in U.S. sales and all 50 states legal to some degree (medical or recreational) by 2021. The prospects of this consistent growth are what's fueled a ferocious rally in marijuana stocks over the past year. A number of cannabis producers and retailers have seen their share prices surge by 100% or more. It also hasn't hurt that more than half of all U.S. states have legalized to some degree, Mexico legalized medical cannabis in June, and Canada is considering legalizing recreational pot by next summer. Image source: Getty Images. However, in spite of these clear positives for marijuana proponents and investors, the industry faces an almost insurmountable hurdle: the federal government. At the federal level, cannabis still holds a Schedule I designation, meaning it's on par with heroin and LSD, is entirely illegal, and has no perceived medical benefits. Lawmakers' worries can essentially be boiled down to two primary concerns. First, they often claim that there isn't enough reliable clinical data on the benefits and risks of medical cannabis to consider altering its scheduling. Though you'll note that there are seemingly hundreds of university-sponsored research studies involving cannabis, there are very few Food and Drug Administration-approved studies involving cannabis and cannabinoids. It's the latter that Congress will want before deciding pot's fate on Capitol Hill. Perhaps the greatest irony here is that lawmakers want more clinical data, but the current scheduling of marijuana makes it extremely difficult to get the OK for researchers to run clinical studies. The second issue many lawmakers have with the legal weed thesis is that it'll make it easier for adolescents to get their hands on pot. Some university studies have shown that adolescent minds can be adversely impacted by marijuana use while their brains are still developing, which makes lawmakers fear home-grow options that often accompany legalization efforts, as well as access to medical cannabis in a household, could ease access for teens. But there may be good news on this latter objection. Image source: Getty Images. Recently, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released findings from its 2016 survey on drug use and health. The results showed that just 6.5% of teens aged 12 to 17 had used marijuana over the past month, which was down 0.5% from 2015, 1.7% from 2002, and is the lowest reading over the past 15 years. Mind you, eight states have voted to legalize adult-use weed since 2012, yet teen use rates have fallen by more than 1% between 2011 and 2016. And this isn't the only data point that suggests teens aren't being lured by marijuana. Pro-legalization reform group Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) pointed out following the release of the SAMHSA report that teen pot use rates in both Colorado and Washington haven't materially changed since they began to sell adult-use weed in 2014. Why the drop despite purportedly easier access to weed? MPP suggests that a tightly regulated industry, coupled with the clear notion that there's a line-in-the-sand legal age requirement for marijuana, has sunk in with adolescents. ""Regulating marijuana for adults reinforces that message and creates effective mechanisms for making it more difficult for teens to obtain marijuana,"" said Morgan Fox, senior communications manager for Marijuana Policy Project. Image source: Getty Images. For those who want to see medical cannabis, or even recreational weed, legalized across the United States, the data from the national SAMHSA report is great news. It wouldn't be surprising if the Canadian parliament looked to this data as well, as it's in the process of debating the legalization of adult-use weed throughout Canada in 2018. One of the biggest objections in Canada has been the home-grow option and the likelihood of adolescent getting their hands on marijuana. Nevertheless, the excitement from this report can only extend so far. When all is said and done, it remains highly unlikely that marijuana has a path to rescheduling under the Trump administration. For starters, Congress is far too busy with healthcare and tax reform at present to consider marijuana legislation. Even if these two issues get tackled, President Trump will likely want to move onto passing an infrastructure bill next. There's next to no room on the docket for cannabis on Capitol Hill. But this is far from the only issue. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will seemingly stop at nothing to ensure that marijuana's expansion is slowed or stopped completely. Sessions hasn't minced words in his views of marijuana, and in May, the attorney general sent a letter to congressional leaders asking them to repeal an amendment that protects medical cannabis businesses from federal prosecution. Sessions seems unwilling to let off the gas in his pursuit to prosecute pot businesses. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is unlikely to be of help, either. It had an opportunity to review two petitions to reschedule marijuana last summer and chose to stand pat on its scheduling. The DEA determined that there wasn't enough clinical benefit-versus-risk data available to alter its scheduling, and noted concerns about abuse and oversight if its scheduling were to be changed. It can take a long time for petitions to work their way up to the DEA, so don't look for any chance of rescheduling anytime soon. Despite industrywide momentum, the ceiling on the industry and marijuana stocks remains very much in place. ","

The first thing that I ask myself when looking for stocks that I could hold in my portfolio forever is ""Will this business be around in 50 years?"" For example, people will need safe places to store their wealth, reliable ways to get around, and access to healthcare. Once it has been established that the industry will endure the test of time, there are a few other attributes to look for in a ""forever stock."" Financial strength, growing revenue, and a shareholder-friendly capital return policy are a few examples. With these things in mind, here are three stocks that you could buy and hold for decades to come. These stocks could build wealth in your portfolio until your retirement and beyond. Image source: Getty Images. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is the fifth-largest bank that's based in the United States, and to be clear, the stock isn't cheap. In fact, the bank's price to-book value is the highest of the largest U.S. banks by far. USB Price to Book Value data by YCharts. However, the stock is expensive for a reason. U.S. Bancorp is consistently the most profitable of the big banks, and the bank has grown tremendously over the past decade or so, emerging from the financial crisis even stronger than it went in. In addition, the bank is among the strongest financial institutions in the U.S. As my colleague John Maxfield recently pointed out, U.S. Bancorp was one of the few banks in the recent Federal Reserve stress tests that would still make money during a hypothetical nine-quarter downturn. This shouldn't be too surprising -- U.S. Bancorp never even had a single quarterly loss during the actual financial crisis. With excellent asset quality, a solid balance sheet, and strong profitability, there's no doubt in my mind that U.S. Bancorp is a stock that you can confidently buy and hold for the long haul. Shares of automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) trade for just 6.1 times trailing-12-month earnings at a time when most of the market looks rather expensive, despite the company posting some excellent profits over the past few years. To be fair, auto industry experts are projecting a downturn in vehicle sales in the next few years, and this is likely to put pressure on General Motors' profits. To name a few examples, analysts at Morgan Stanley see auto sales peaking in 2017, while J.D. Power is projecting a small drop this year. However, there's still a good case to be made, even if a rather large drop in auto sales does occur. The company is generating enough cash to cover its 4% dividend several times over, and has plenty of cash in reserve. In fact, it is committed to maintaining a cash reserve of $18 billion. Operating margins have been expanding thanks to the popularity of highly profitable vehicles such as crossovers and pickup trucks. Finally, it has become a leader in innovation and plans to stay that way, even throughout a downturn. In a nutshell, this is not the same General Motors that existed before the Great Recession. In fact, GM has become a solid, well-run company that is capable of thriving in any environment, but it's trading at a valuation as if it were headed toward insolvency. Healthcare is certainly an industry that will be needed forever -- regardless of what happens with the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) and other healthcare legislation, people will always need quality medical care. My favorite way to invest in healthcare is through real estate, specifically the types of healthcare properties that stand to benefit from the expected growth in the U.S. population. Ventas (NYSE:VTR) is one of the largest healthcare real estate investment trusts (REITs), and it has a lot of opportunity for growth over the coming decades. Ventas owns more than 1,200 properties, and about 55% (by net operating income) are senior housing, with another 19% comprised of medical offices. Life science facilities, health systems, and a few other property types take up the rest. Ninety-four percent of tenants' revenue comes from private-pay revenue sources, which are more stable than government reimbursements like Medicare and Medicaid. To make a long story short, Ventas is a forever stock because it is one of the largest and most efficient operators, and should have tremendous growth opportunities as the senior citizen population grows over the coming decades. The 75-and-older age group is expected to grow by 14 million people by 2030, and is growing at seven times the rate of the overall population. In addition, less than 15% of healthcare properties are REIT-owned, which will create a lot of opportunity for consolidation. And Ventas' size and financial flexibility give it a major advantage over peers. ","

Politico said the flights took the HHS chief to a resort in Maine where he participated in a discussion with a health-care industry CEO, and to community health centers in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. HHS spokespeople declined to confirm details of the flights or respond to questions about who paid for them, Politico said. A spokesperson told Politico that Price sometimes charters planes when commercial flights aren’t feasible. Charter operators estimated the five flights would cost at least $60,000, Politico said.

140,Jacob Passy,9212017,MarketWatch,9142017,"Published: Sept 20, 2017 4:37 p.m. ET North Carolina becomes the latest state to join the effort to uphold climate change agreement despite Trump’s pull-out. By The state-based movement to continue meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change following President Trump’s choice to withdraw is making headway. The U.S. Climate Alliance, as the group is called, said Wednesday that it is on track to meet and possibly surpass its portion of the Paris Agreement’s targets of a 24% to 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emission rates from 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted in 2015 by 195 countries, aims to reduce emissions in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The bipartisan coalition of states was created by three Democratic governors — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, California Gov. Jerry Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee — after President Trump announced in June his plan to withdraw the U.S. from the international accord. North Carolina became the latest and 15th state to join the U.S. Climate Alliance, which also includes Puerto Rico. Additionally, two states with Republican governors, Massachusetts and Vermont, are part of the alliance. “Either we end this problem or this problem will end us,” Cuomo said during a press conference in New York, which was also attended by Brown, Inslee and former Secretary of State John Kerry. In recent days, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be reconsidering its stance on the agreement, but the White House later issued a statement saying that there had been no change to the U.S.’s position. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also tweeted that the U.S. will withdraw “unless we get pro-America terms.” Don’t miss: 11 ways to build a Paris climate change accord — in your own community During the press conference, the attendees lambasted the president’s choice to pull out of the agreement. “No burden was placed on the United States other than what we in the United States set for ourselves,” Kerry said. “He forfeited American leadership.” The governors and Kerry also made repeated references to the hurricanes that have made landfall on U.S. soil — Harvey, Irma and now Maria — as well as the wildfires burning across the West Coast as an indication of what could occur if climate change worsens. The U.S. Climate Alliance is just one way in which state governments are working to continue the U.S.’s commitment to the climate change agreement despite Trump’s actions. Cuomo touted New York’s Green Bank, a state-sponsored financial entity that aims to increase investment in clean energy markets, and said that the bank will be going national. He also expressed interest in potentially working with California on a carbon market.

Prices for the yellow metal had gained for the session as the dollar dipped and U.S. equities paused their run to fresh records. But the greenback strengthened, putting pressure on dollar-denominated gold in the wake of the Fed’s statement, which came after gold futures prices settled for the session. Gold “bulls are likely to be stressed as the market adjusts to incorporate Fed rate increases,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist of U.S. Bancorp Wealth Management. “Prices are likely to see pressure through rest of year based on solid economic trends and markets beginning to price Fed rate increases.” In electronic trading, gold for December delivery

The Fed on Wednesday indicated it still plans to raise interest rates once more by the end of this year, but it also signaled that its cycle of rate hikes might end sooner than planned. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, said gold prices moved lower after the FOMC statement “because the market has perceived the statement as somewhat hawkish.” “The Fed still thinks that more interest-rate hikes are possible despite the fact that the size of the balance sheet will also be reduced,” he said. The central bank said it would taper its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by $10 billion a month.

                                   meanwhile, slipped 31.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 6,429.08. A reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000. Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday’s data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher. “CPI was a bit above expectations,” but market participants can’t be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed’s 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was “not so strong that it’s likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.” Inflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve’s target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017. On Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session. The equity market’s continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations. “The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,” said Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945. However, Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. “If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,” he said. “Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,” he said. “But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,” Kepner added, referring to a decline of at least 20%. Read:  Stock market’s 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls Earlier Thursday, North Korea made more threats in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and “reduce the U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness.” The acerbic rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports.

Trump tweeted early Thursday that no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement with him to enact protections for “Dreamers” in exchange for increased border-security measures that don’t include funding for a wall.

145,Barry Eichengreen,9212017,MarketWatch,9142017,"Structural reforms since financial crisis are slowly but surely starting to bear fruit, with the lowest unemployment since 2009 and production ratcheted up Jennifer Rankin Sat 16 Sep 2017 16.00 BST


Last modified on Sat 2 Dec 2017 02.44 GMT It was a story few predicted: the eurozone is growing faster than the United States. When Jean-Claude Juncker gave his annual state of the union speech on Wednesday last week, Europe’s booming economy was near the top of his list. Ten years since the crisis struck, “Europe’s economy is finally bouncing back,” the European commission president told MEPs. Detailing the economic resurgence, but also referring to the EU’s newfound unity after Britain’s vote to leave, Juncker declared: “the wind is back in Europe’s sails”. In fact, growth in the 19-country eurozone has quietly outshone the US for the last two years. The latest annualised growth numbers show the single currency bloc growing at 2.3%, compared with 2.2% for the world’s largest economy. Eurozone unemployment has fallen to the lowest level since 2009, while factories are humming again, with production up 3.2% on last year. The upturn in fortunes is likely to continue, says James Nixon, chief European economist at consultancy Oxford Economics. “The euro area has done a lot of work over the last decade to get its house in order and also a lot structural reform. That has been an extraordinary, excruciatingly slow process but it is starting to bear fruit.” The eurozone might be doing better, but the crisis has left deep scars and many wounds are far from healed. In France, the economy is expanding at an annualised rate of 1.7%, fuelled by confidence in French president Emmanuel Macron and his reform agenda, but growth continues to lag the eurozone average. Germany’s economy remains solid, but Germans are increasingly worried about inequality and low-wage jobs. Spain has bounced back from the crisis, but inequality is rising and unemployment remains painfully high at 17% - second only to Greece. Italy’s economy is doing better, but worries remain over its heavily indebted banks. Despite the rapid pace of job creation, eurozone unemployment remains high (9.1%), worse than the EU average (7.7%) and the US (4.3%). Eurozone economies would need to be expanding faster to generate steeper falls in unemployment, says Cinzia Alcidi, head of economic policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies. “The outlook for the euro area has improved a lot but we are still closer to 2% than 3% [economic growth] so the effect [on unemployment] will be milder and will take more time.” This explains why eurozone watchers are focused on economic reforms. Above all they are looking at whether Macron can succeed in pushing through far-reaching labour reforms to make it easier for small and medium-sized firms to fire workers, thus boosting hiring. French ministers believe such reforms will make it easier for the young and low-qualified to break into the labour market. If France succeeds, pressure is likely to build on Italy to undertake similar measures. “It is possible that, in this framework this could be the start of a decade-long period of expansion, golden years for the euro area,” argues Nixon. European leaders also want to push on with eurozone reforms. Two days after the German elections on 24 September, Macron is expected to set out a detailed blueprint of his ideas, which include a eurozone finance minister and parliament. “Either the eurozone moves from being an imperfect monetary union to a true economic continent, or it could disappear,” finance minister Bruno Le Maire told the Financial Times last week. But there are differences on the detail. “There is a certain alignment in the broad ideas, but... divergences on how to make this happen,” says Alcidi at CEPS. “French ideas could be much more ambitious than Germany could accept,” she says. Differences are likely to emerge over the size of a eurozone budget or what it should be used for. Beyond shoring up the eurozone, the EU is also pressing ahead on trade: the election of Donald Trump on an “America First” ticket helped bring the long-discussed EU-Japan trade deal closer to the finish line. This week Juncker said the commission wanted to start trade talks with Australia and New Zealand - perhaps one in the eye for Brexit dreams of “Canzuk”, a trading alliance of English-speaking commonwealth countries. “The UK position is looking very, very lonely,” Nixon says. “The UK argument, to a certain extent, has always been that we didn’t want to be part of what looked like a failing club and I always felt that was a very Anglo-Saxon jaundiced way of looking at things [that underestimated] the political commitment to making this fly.” ",The eurozone strikes back – why Europe is booming again | Business | The Guardian,-0.9234

                                    and opening borders per the Schengen agreement was so out of step with reality and with the mood in EU countries that he seemed to be on a different planet. In fact, the German daily Die Welt thought the idea of a Bulgaria or a Romania joining the euro was so absurd that one had to ask “on what distant star the spaceship EU under its Captain Juncker has spent the last few years.” Sahra Wagenknecht, a leader of the Left party in Germany — who takes advantage of her party’s marginal status to speak more pointedly than mainstream politicians — said “Mr. Juncker seems to have taken leave of his senses.” The euro is already causing enough damage to the countries that have it, without extending it to the rest of the EU, she said. Even the liberal Guardian, which has been steadfastly pro-Europe, said “Juncker’s federalist vision for the EU is far from reality.” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described Juncker as a “romantic,” the paper reported, and suggested that people with vision see an eye doctor. But a counter vision offered up by dissidents concerned about the “democratic deficit” in an EU governed by unaccountable technocrats is equally unrealistic. Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis is spearheading a group called Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, or DiEM25, to promote a different kind of EU. In a New York Times op-ed in July, Varoufakis embarked on a convoluted analysis of how insiders and outsiders were outside and inside the establishment. French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance, was an outsider who upended the French establishment but really has an insider austerity agenda. While Varoufakis’s bitter critique is often right, his solutions seem as far-fetched as Juncker’s vision. “The answer lies in ditching both globalism and isolationism in favor of an authentic internationalism,” he suggested, whatever that means. He wants an International New Deal, modeled on Franklin Roosevelt’s program during the Great Depression to mobilize idle private money for public purposes. He suggests the Group of 20 oversee a massive fundraising coordinated by central banks with development institutions (World Bank et al.) issuing bonds to soak up global savings and spend it on projects to alleviate poverty, develop human capital and so on. Really? Perhaps in an alternate universe. The problem with any grand vision of how to integrate and restructure Europe is that’s not the way history happens. And Europe has a lot of history. Grafting on some notion of a United States of Europe is antithetical to that history, and virtually impossible to achieve politically. In that sense, the notions of a multi-speed Europe propagated by the likes of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble outside of election campaign time, are more realistic. Especially if one of the speeds is reverse. The EU probably reached its peak as a free-trade zone and common market, before the debut of a joint currency and a European Central Bank put member states in a straitjacket that benefited Germany but created problems for other countries. The mistake was to proceed with integration at a forced march even as the bloc expanded to take in the newly liberated countries in Eastern Europe. From the get-go, the political elite have wanted to force the scope and pace of integration. They largely refused to let voters have their say in national referendums on EU membership with all its specific terms or on the joint currency with all its conditions. This was more of a “democracy disconnect,” as Varoufakis observes, that a democracy deficit. A multi-speed Europe, or Europe a la carte, is much more in keeping with European culture and tradition than the effort to create a United States of Europe. The overlapping fealties of a Holy Roman Empire or a Duchy of Burgundy, the commercial connections of a Hanseatic League, or the comfortable tolerances of the Hapsburg Empire are better models for European relations than the runaway centralizing bureaucracy in Brussels. There is no need to force Britain to leave Europe, nor to keep countries like Norway and Switzerland at the door like orphaned stepchildren. In his speech, Juncker proposed “streamlining” EU structure by concentrating power in a single president, combining the roles of Commission president (Juncker) and the European Council president (Donald Tusk). Instead, the EU should become looser, more flexible, less centralized, with more dispersion of power. There’s no need to try to imitate our United States. Europe has its own political traditions that have evolved over centuries, and they should be allowed to evolve on their own, even if takes a few more centuries.

148,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Health stocks are highly sensitive to news about regulatory and legislative change. This week is another test with the latest Republican effort to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. The overall S&P 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC has underperformed the broader stock market in the past two weeks as Senate Republicans seek to generate enough support to overhaul Obamacare with their latest bill, known as Graham-Cassidy. The sector rebounded somewhat on Tuesday as odds for the bill’s passage appeared to diminish after a key senator opposed it. The Senate faces a Saturday deadline because of an expiring rule that lets the Republican healthcare legislation pass with just a simple majority. Here are the main stocks expected to move most from news over the Republican repeal efforts: Graham-Cassidy repeals enhanced federal funding for the Medicaid expansion beginning in 2020 and limits spending through a per capital cap. It also adds uncertainty by providing Medicaid funding through block grants to states that allows them to implement their own rules. “The Graham-Cassidy bill is looking to reduce funding for Medicaid in the longer term. That is a benefit that we have seen improve the earnings outlooks for these hospitals,” said Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut. The proposal also repeals the requirement that individuals buy insurance or pay a fine, known as the individual mandate, which also could reduce insurance coverage, hurting hospitals. One possible positive for hospitals could be the bill’s increase of funding to states that did not previously expand Medicaid under Obamacare, where some publicly traded hospital companies have facilities, said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street. “The perception would be fewer members on Medicaid and therefore less revenue,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management. But Funtleyder said one benefit could be if the Medicaid block grants to states lead them to seek more services from the companies. But Smolinski notes that while prior Republican repeal bills sought to roll back an industry fee - which was seen as positive for insurers - the Graham-Cassidy bill does not end that fee. At the same time, these larger insurers have significant Medicaid businesses, and the bill leaves Medicaid funding uncertain after 10 years. “If you think about them with regard to the Medicaid business, then that’s probably a little bit of a headwind for them,” Smolinski said. “They are the only industry that got relief here,” Smolinski said. Overall, the passage of the bill could revive regulatory uncertainty over the broader healthcare sector, which hurt its performance ahead of the U.S. election last year. Through Monday, the healthcare sector had climbed 18.2 percent in 2017, topping the 11.5 percent rise for the overall S&P 500 .SPX. “If investors start worrying about what comes next or implementation issues, you could see a rotation into other sectors,” Funtleyder said.

149,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called their “last best chance” to repeal Obamacare while a new analysis underscored how Democratic-leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. With no Democratic support for the bill, Republicans remain a handful of votes short in the Senate, needing 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48, with Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. Senator Rand Paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Asked whether the legislation will pass, Pence said, “We’ll see. We’re close.” Republicans, still reeling from their failure in July to win Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, have set a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. “This may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head America back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that’s based on individual-choice, state-based innovations,” Pence told Fox New Channel. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. The current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet assessed the bill’s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on Thursday that states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non-expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. The Graham-Cassidy bill in 2020 would end the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which many Democratic-governed states had carried out while many Republican-governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five-decade-old program regardless of how many Americans qualify for its benefits. Republicans have called Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020-2026: New York (down 35 percent), Oregon (down 32 percent), Connecticut (down 31 percent), Vermont (down 31 percent) and Minnesota (down 30 percent). All are Democratic leaning. The analysis found that six Republican-leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: Mississippi (up 148 percent), Texas (up 75 percent), Kansas (up 61 percent), Georgia (up 46 percent), South Dakota (up 45 percent) and Tennessee (up 44 percent). In total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is California, losing $56 billion. The biggest gainer would be Texas, with a $34 billion increase. California, the most populous U.S. state, is Democratic leaning. Texas is the second most populous state and the largest Republican-leaning one. “It’s absolutely true to say the Graham-Cassidy bill over time levels out on a per-person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which I think resonates with most Americans,” Pence said. McCain, Collins and Murkowski were the three Republicans who voted against the last Republican healthcare legislation brought up in the Senate, which failed 51-49 in July. Paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on Thursday went to Twitter to underscore his criticism that the Graham-Cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase Obamacare. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. More medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the Graham-Cassidy bill on Thursday, including the American Psychological Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NAACP. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. The Graham-Cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.

150,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday blasted Senator John McCain for dealing a possibly fatal blow to the latest Republican attempt to dismantle Obamacare. According to a new independent analysis, the bill awaiting a Senate vote could lead to 21 million fewer Americans having health insurance. McCain, an Arizona Republican who is being treated for brain cancer and cast a crucial “no” vote to defeat a similar bill in July, said on Friday that he could not “in good conscience” vote for the proposal authored by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham. “He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!” Trump wrote about McCain on Twitter early Saturday morning. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will schedule a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill by Sept. 30, the last day when it could pass in the chamber with a simple majority of 51 votes instead of the 60 typically required. The bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help individuals buy private insurance, and deliver it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes legislation, has not had time to assess the Graham-Cassidy bill before the expected vote. McCain, a close friend of Graham, said he could not support it without knowing how much it would cost, its effect on insurance premiums, and how many people would be affected. But the Brookings Institution said on Friday that the Graham-Cassidy bill could leave at least 21 million fewer Americans with health insurance by 2020 to 2026. The Washington think tank has generally been supportive of Obamacare, which is formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The coverage estimate “likely understates” reductions in insured Americans because it is not clear how states would use the money or if they would face obstacles in setting up new programs, according to Brookings researchers. “What is clear, however, is that the legislation would result in very large reductions in insurance coverage,” they wrote. Late Saturday, six associations representing U.S. doctors, hospitals and insurers said they opposed the bill because it would cause patients with pre-existing conditions to lose coverage and result in more expensive health insurance. “The Senate should reject it,” the groups said in a statement. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told Fox News Channel’s ‘America’s News HQ’ on Saturday that he is “providing technical assistance and information” to senators working on the bill. Price said that the bill was “not dead” despite McCain’s announcement and wavering support from several other Republican senators. “The reason it’s not dead is because it’s not finished. The bill hasn’t been completed. We continue to work with the authors on it through this weekend,” Price said. The Senate Finance Committee on Monday will hold a hearing on the Graham-Cassidy bill. Cassidy, a physician, is expected to testify. CBO estimates of previous Republican proposals showed they could lead to more than 20 million fewer insured Americans. This complicated passage in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats and Democrats are unanimously opposed to repeal-and-replace measures. Republicans need at least 50 votes to pass the bill, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has said she was leaning against the Graham-Cassidy bill, as has Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski are undecided. After blasting McCain, Trump on Saturday singled out Paul and Murkowski. “I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Regarding Murkowski, he tweeted that in Alaska: “Deductibles high, people angry!” The insurance industry, hospitals, consumer activists, the AARP advocacy group and organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society all oppose the bill. Shares of some health insurers closed higher on Friday after McCain announced his opposition. Centene Corp ended up 1.6 percent,  while Humana Inc gained 0.2 percent and Aetna Inc rose 0.1 percent, reversing earlier losses. ","

Commercial Bank on Tuesday said it entered into a 90-day period of exclusivity with a “third party purchaser” it did not name to negotiate the terms of a deal, according to a statement on the Qatar bourse Privately-owned Tabarak is in early stage discussions with CBQ, the sources said, declining to be named as the matter is not yet public. “They even have a price commitment pending that due diligence,” said one of the sources. Tabarak declined to comment.  Qatar’s Commercial Bank said in an email to Reuters that the bank received interest from a number of potential buyers for UAB’s shares and have accepted a conditional offer from one. “Their identity is confidential as per the terms of our agreement,” CBQ said. Commercial Bank’s stake in United Arab Bank is worth around $217 million, according to Thomson Reuters data. The move is the latest sign of Qatari companies weighing an exit from the United Arab Emirates, which is part of a group of Arab countries that had cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5. Tabarak, which calls itself a private equity vehicle has a stake in Dubai’s Drake & Scull International and is invested in sectors such as education, industry, logistics and healthcare.

152,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday slapped new travel restrictions on citizens from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad, expanding to eight the list of countries covered by his original travel bans that have been derided by critics and challenged in court. Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia were left on the list of affected countries in a new proclamation issued by the president. Restrictions on citizens from Sudan were lifted. The measures help fulfil a campaign promise Trump made to tighten U.S. immigration procedures and align with his “America First” foreign policy vision. Unlike the president’s original bans, which had time limits, this one is open-ended. “Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,” the president said in a tweet shortly after the proclamation was released. Iraqi citizens will not be subject to travel prohibitions but will face enhanced scrutiny or vetting. The current ban, enacted in March, was set to expire on Sunday evening. The new restrictions are slated to take effect on Oct. 18 and resulted from a review after Trump’s original travel bans sparked international outrage and legal challenges. The addition of North Korea and Venezuela broadens the restrictions from the original, mostly Muslim-majority list. An administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, acknowledged that the number of North Koreans now travelling to the United States was very low. Rights group Amnesty International USA condemned the measures. “Just because the original ban was especially outrageous does not mean we should stand for yet another version of government-sanctioned discrimination,” it said in a statement. “It is senseless and cruel to ban whole nationalities of people who are often fleeing the very same violence that the U.S. government wishes to keep out. This must not be normalized.” The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement the addition of North Korea and Venezuela “doesn’t obfuscate the real fact that the administration’s order is still a Muslim ban.” The White House portrayed the restrictions as consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas. Those requirements were shared in July with foreign governments, which had 50 days to make improvements if needed, the White House said. A number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen. Others did not, sparking the restrictions. The announcement came as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments on Oct. 10 over the legality of Trump’s previous travel ban, including whether it discriminated against Muslims. Trump has threatened to “destroy” North Korea if it attacks the United States or its allies. Pyongyang earlier this month conducted its most powerful nuclear bomb test. The president  has also directed harsh criticism at Venezuela, once hinting at a potential military option to deal with Caracas. But the officials described the addition of the two countries to Trump’s travel restrictions as the result of a purely objective review. In the case of North Korea, where the suspension was sweeping and applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, officials said it was hard for the United States to validate the identity of someone coming from North Korea or to find out if that person was a threat. “North Korea, quite bluntly, does not cooperate whatsoever,” one official said. The restrictions on Venezuela focused on Socialist government officials that the Trump administration blamed for the country’s slide into economic disarray, including officials from the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service and their immediate families. Trump received a set of policy recommendations on Friday from acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke and was briefed on the matter by other administration officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a White House aide said. The rollout on Sunday was decidedly more organised than Trump’s first stab at a travel ban, which was unveiled with little warning and sparked protests at airports worldwide. Earlier on Sunday, Trump told reporters about the ban: “The tougher, the better.” Rather than a total ban on entry to the United States, the proposed restrictions differ by nation, based on cooperation with American security mandates, the threat the United States believes each country presents and other variables, officials said. Somalis, for example, are barred from entering the United States as immigrants and subjected to greater screening for visits. After the Sept. 15 bombing attack on a London train, Trump wrote on Twitter that the new ban “should be far larger, tougher and more specific - but stupidly, that would not be politically correct.” The expiring ban blocked entry into the United States by people from the six countries for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days to give Trump’s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of U.S. vetting procedures for foreign visitors. Critics have accused the Republican president of discriminating against Muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law, breaking existing U.S. immigration law and stoking religious hatred. Some federal courts blocked the ban, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to take effect in June with some restrictions. ","

153,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea told a U.N. rights panel that international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs would endanger the survival of North Korean children. Han Tae Song, Pyongyang’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, was speaking at a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child late on Wednesday. The panel of independent experts challenged North Korean officials over allegations of forced child labor, sexual abuse and trafficking in North Korea, Pyongyang’s health and education budget, and Internet access for children. Han said North Korea, whose population is 26 million, is a “people-centered socialist country... where protection and promotion of the rights and welfare of the child are given top priority ... There is room for improvement.” But Han said that new sanctions imposed by the United States and the U.N. Security Council over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests were hampering the production of nutritional goods for children and provision of textbooks. “The persistent and vicious blockade and sanctions against the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) are not only hampering the endeavors for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child but also seriously threatening their right to survival,” he said, calling for sanctions to be lifted. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006, the latest earlier this month capping fuel supplies to the isolated state. Han said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un - denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump as “Rocket Man” - “personally guides the construction in different parts of the country of schoolchildren’s palaces, children’s hospitals, baby homes, children’s homes, and primary and secondary boarding schools and works with devotion for the well-being of the young generation”. South Korea approved a plan on Thursday to send $8 million worth of aid to North Korea as China warned the crisis on the divided Korean peninsula was getting more serious by the day and the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington continued. The U.N. panel asked how North Korea’s “songbun” (caste system) that ranks citizens based on family loyalty to the ruling dynasty affected children’s access to education, health and food. The North Korean delegation replied that this was an “imaginary concept” invented by hostile forces. Human Rights Watch has called on the rights panel to press North Korea’s delegation on cases of child sexual abuse, which the New York-based group said it had documented. “The (North Korean government) report was silent on the issue of sexual abuse so the delegation was asked to provide data,” read a U.N. summary of the hearing. North Korea’s delegation said that forced child labor did not exist in the country and was banned, and that the maximum duration of young people’s work in agricultural fields was limited to three weeks per year. “In response to a question on the use of the Internet, the delegation explained that there was public control of this medium in order to give preference to access to positive information for children. In addition, all children had access to the (North Korean internal) Intranet,” the summary said. The committee will issue its conclusions on Oct. 4. ","

154,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"(Reuters Health) - Nearly 50 alcohol-flavored tobacco product lines are marketed by more than 400 tobacco brands in the United States and these products may especially attract teens, luring them into tobacco addiction, according to a new study. Adolescent drinking and smoking tend to go hand in hand, the authors write in the journal Tobacco Control, and the combination of alcohol flavors in tobacco products is sure to appeal to teen users. So-called characterizing flavors in cigarettes, except for menthol, are banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and these restrictions should be extended to the many flavored tobaccos for cigars, cigarillos and hookahs, as well as e-cigarette liquids, they add. “We were surprised by the large number of brands of alcohol-flavored tobacco products on the market and the wide variety of alcoholic flavors,” said lead author Dr. Robert Jackler of Stanford University in California. “Not surprisingly, sweet and fruity varieties . . . which appeal to teenagers predominated,” he told Reuters Health by email. Jackler and colleagues analyzed the top 20 U.S. brands of cigarillos and e-cigarettes using the Nielsen database, which includes unit sales in 25 major chains and 14,000 convenience stores. They also looked for the top hookah and shisha brands online. Then they searched among the top brands for products with flavors related to alcoholic beverages such as beer, appletini and margarita. The research team found 455 e-cigarette brands and more than 100 flavored cigar, cigarillo and hookah brands. The most popular fruity flavors were pina colada, mojito and margarita, and the most popular spirit flavors were rum, bourbon and whiskey. The cigars and cigarillos were marketed by large, multinational tobacco companies such as Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, Swisher International, Swedish Match and Scandinavian Tobacco Group, and the e-cigarette flavors were nearly all offered by minor brands, the study team notes. “We found it disturbing that major international tobacco companies, which claim to be socially responsible and who profess they would never target underage youth, produce a wide spectrum of flavored mini-cigars and e-cigarettes, including quite a few with alcohol-themed names,” Jackler said. In 2009, the FDA banned flavors other than menthol from traditional cigarettes, but rulings about e-cigarettes and other tobacco products are still under discussion. Since 2009, California cities such as San Francisco, Oakland, Sonoma, El Cerrito, Manhattan Beach and Berkeley have banned some flavored tobacco products. In June, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously banned flavored tobacco. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which makes Newport menthol cigarettes, is reported to have spent $700,000 on a campaign to collect 34,000 signatures and bring a referendum before city voters. The choice will be on the ballot in June 2018. “If R.J. Reynolds spent this much money on a local policy in one city, they’re sending a message that these bans could severely hurt their business and affect who smokes,” said Dr. Pamela Ling of the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved with the study. “We’re going to see vociferous conversations about tobacco flavors in coming months (in San Francisco),” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “I think some people were misled when they were asked to sign the petition and didn’t realize what it was about.” Jackler and colleagues are now studying how flavored products are advertised to appeal to teens. They’re comparing the differences on social media channels such as Twitter, which predominantly appeals to adult smokers, and Instagram, which appeals to younger smokers, he said. “Our overall goal is to provide legislators and regulators with the evidence they need to enact effective regulations to protect American teens,” Jackler said. Ling encourages parents to be informed and take a stand in their communities as well. “Parents should take action and say they don’t want these products in their stores or neighborhoods,” she said. “There’s not a good scientific reason to leave these products on the market. We should protect our young people.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2fcHpyA Tobacco Control, August 23, 2017. ","

155,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"France angered Italy in July by ordering a “temporary” nationalization of STX, cancelling a deal in which Fincantieri and another Italian investor had agreed to buy 55 percent of the firm, based in Saint-Nazaire in western France. On the back of Wednesday’s deal, which will see Fincantieri effectively holding a 51 percent stake in STX France, Paris and Rome will explore the creation of a Franco-Italian naval defense group, merging French military shipyards company Naval Group with Fincantieri, Macron’s office said. France sees the creation of European champions as crucial to warding off the threat posed by industrial powers in China and the United States. The STX deal comes a day after Macron offered an ambitious vision for European renewal, calling on the continent to forge deeper cooperation. While Macron, who took office barely five months ago, initially appeared determined to protect French strategic assets at all costs, the deals between Alstom and Siemens and now Fincantieri and STX suggest he is willing to see French control diluted if it opens the way for a bigger European champion. Under the terms of Wednesday’s agreement, Fincantieri will take a 50 percent stake in STX. The French state will hold 34.34 percent, Naval Group 10 percent, STX staff 2 percent and STX local suppliers 3.66 percent. In order for Fincantieri to take effective control, the French state will lend it a one percent stake. Paris will have the right to demand the holding back if Fincantieri does not honor commitments on jobs, governance or intellectual property. Before Macron’s July intervention, Fincantieri had agreed in May to pay 79.5 million euros ($93.4 million) for a majority stake in STX France, which was being sold following the collapse of South Korean parent STX. But amid concerns about jobs and the firm’s strategic importance, Paris backtracked on that deal. An Italian Treasury source said Fincantieri had secured a better deal this time as it would now hold a 51 percent stake and not 48 percent. “Now it is possible to work on a 50-50 partnership in the civil and military ship building industry,” the source said, referring to the plans for a wider naval defense partnership. STX’s Saint-Nazaire yard is the only one big enough in France to build aircraft carriers and other large warships, making it a strategic national asset. “I hope that in the naval sector, without wishing to give away anything that might arrive this evening, we can also move towards a world giant in terms of industrial, naval construction  - on a European scale,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters earlier on Wednesday, reiterating his support for the tie-up between Siemens and Alstom.

156,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Supporters of former South Korean president Park Geun-hye have asked a United Nations body to investigate whether her detention during her corruption trial was preventing Park from getting proper medical treatment, a barrister said on Tuesday. Park, ousted earlier this year and in detention since March, is undergoing a lower court trial for charges of abuse of power and bribery. Her current detention period for the lower court trial is due to end on October 17, which the prosecution asked the court to extend on Tuesday. A legal team working for Park’s supporters has asked the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in Geneva to look into whether Park was given medical treatment and whether there were procedural irregularities in her current trial, said Rodney Dixon QC, a London-based human rights barrister. “She is not a flight risk... She has been denied opportunity to receive adequate medical care through provisional release or options of house arrest,” said Dixon. Since her detention began in late March, Park has declined witness appearances in concurrent trials citing health issues, and various South Korean media have reported her as having chronic back and shoulder pains, difficulty sleeping and nodding off more than once during hearings. South Korea’s justice ministry, which oversees the Seoul Detention Center where Park is held, said all detainees are guaranteed ample chances to receive medical care both inside the center and at outside medical facilities when needed, and as such Park is receiving proper medical care. The ministry declined to disclose Park’s exact medical conditions as they are private. Seoul Central District Court, where Park’s trial is ongoing, directed questions about Park to the justice ministry as detention is its purview. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention did not respond to a request for comment. Although the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention does not have the power to enforce an action, it can seek information from the South Korean government, organize a visit to Park to investigate and announce its findings. The team working on behalf of Park’s supporters said in a statement this month it will also bring Park’s case before the U.N. Human Rights Council in November during a periodic review of South Korea’s human rights compliance. ","

157,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"YANGON/DHAKA (Reuters) - The United States wants Myanmar to take urgent action to end violence in Rakhine state, where a military offensive has created a crisis that could jeopardize its economic and political transition, a U.S. official said on Friday. Bangladesh and aid organizations are struggling to help 422,000 Rohingya Muslims who have arrived since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants triggered a Myanmar crackdown that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. (For graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2xTId74) A senior U.N. official said an estimated $200 million would be needed to help the refugees in Bangladesh for six months. Aid workers fear a humanitarian crisis is also unfolding in Rakhine state, though Myanmar has restricted access. “We think, urgently, actions need to be taken to stop this violence and facilitate humanitarian assistance, lower the rhetoric, lower the tension and ... start doing the hard work to solve the longer-standing problems,” U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy told reporters. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of international criticism over the plight of the Rohingya, for not speaking out more forcefully against the violence or doing more to rein in security forces over which she has little power. Sweden, the United States, Britain, France, Egypt, Senegal, and Kazakhstan asked on Friday for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to publicly brief the 15-member Security Council next week on the violence. Tension between majority Buddhists and Rohingya, most of whom are denied citizenship, has simmered for decades in Rakhine, but it has exploded several times over the past few years, as old enmities, and Buddhist nationalism, surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule. Murphy, who spent three days in Myanmar this week, said there were “many points of responsibility” and he wanted to see everyone follow through on commitments Suu Kyi made to uphold rights and the law in an address to the nation on Tuesday. “There’s the elected government, there are the security forces which have authorities that don’t fall under the purview of the civilian elected government, there are local leaders and there is the broader population, among which there are many emotions and many tensions,” he said. “Significant responsibility sits with security authorities and local officials in Rakhine state and we are looking for their cooperation to make these commitments a reality,” Murphy told reporters on a conference call from Bangkok. Myanmar dismisses accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying it has to tackle the insurgents, whom it accuses of setting fires and attacking civilians as well as the security forces. While the United States has urged action to halt the violence, China, which has close economic and political ties with Myanmar, has welcomed measures by the government to alleviate the situation in Rakhine state. Murphy said the military’s response to the August insurgent attacks had been disproportionate and the country risked a terrorist backlash. The attacks were claimed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which Murphy referred to as a “so-called group” of which little was known. It denies links to foreign militants but the government says it is connected to global terrorism. “Whether or not this organization has ties elsewhere is not particularly germane, given the fact that it could be creating an incentive for foreign terrorists to look at a new opportunity and this is among the risks that we have shared with Burmese stakeholders,” he said. Bangladesh was already home to some 400,000 Rohingya who fled earlier bouts of violence and persecution. Given the “massive numbers” arriving in the past few weeks, the United Nations was expected to launch an appeal for $200 million to help them for the next six months, an official said. “It has not been confirmed, but it is a ballpark figure, based on the information we have,” Robert D. Watkins, U.N. resident coordinator in Bangladesh, told Reuters in an interview in Dhaka. Watkins said the situation had not stabilized in terms of new arrivals so it was difficult to say how many people to plan for, or how long. “We don’t want to plan a 10-year operation, obviously, because we want to maintain hope that there will be a way for negotiating a return of the population,” he said. “We can’t plan too far in the future, because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy ... politically, it sends a strong signal, which we don’t want to send, which is that people are going to be here for a long time. “And our donors are not prepared to respond to anything beyond a one-year time frame, given the massive amounts of money we are asking for.” Aid groups in Bangladesh have warned of a public health disaster unless help is increased massively. “We need to scale up quickly,” said Dr N. Paranietharan, the World Health Organisation representative in Bangladesh. “If we don’t drastically improve water and sanitation we will face water-borne diseases including cholera.” ","

158,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Doctors treating some of the 429,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar in recent weeks have seen dozens of women with injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks, U.N. clinicians and other health workers said. The medics’ accounts, backed in some cases by medical notes reviewed by Reuters, lend weight to repeated allegations, ranging from molestation to gang rape, levelled by women from the stateless minority group against Myanmar’s armed forces. Myanmar officials have mostly dismissed such allegations as militant propaganda designed to defame its military, which they say is engaged in legitimate counterinsurgency operations and under orders to protect civilians. Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said the authorities would investigate any allegations brought to them. “Those rape victim women should come to us,” he said. “We will give full security to them. We will investigate and we will take action.” Suu Kyi herself has not commented on the numerous allegations of sexual assault committed by the military against Rohingya women made public since late last year. Violence erupted in Myanmar’s northwestern Rakhine state following attacks on security forces by Rohingya militants last October. Further attacks on Aug. 25 provoked a renewed military offensive the United Nations has called “ethnic cleansing”. Reuters spoke with eight health and protection workers in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district who between them said they had treated more than 25 individual rape cases since late August. The medics say they do not attempt to establish definitively what happened to their patients, but have seen an unmistakeable pattern in the stories and physical symptoms of dozens of women, who invariably say Myanmar soldiers were the perpetrators. It is rare for U.N. doctors and aid agencies to speak about rape allegedly committed by a state’s armed forces, given the sensitivity of the matter. Doctors at a clinic run by the U.N’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) at the Leda makeshift refugee say they treated hundreds of women with injuries they said were from violent sexual assaults during the army operation in October and November. There have been fewer rapes reported among the influx of refugees since August, said Dr. Niranta Kumar, the clinic’s health coordinator, but those they have seen have injuries suggesting “more aggressive” attacks on women. Several health workers suggested that, whereas in October many women had initially remained in their villages believing the army sweeps were only targeting Rohingya men, this time most had fled at the first sign of military activity. Doctors at the Leda clinic showed a Reuters reporter three case files, without divulging the identity of the patients. One said a 20-year-old woman was treated on Sept. 10, seven days after she said she was raped by a soldier in Myanmar. Handwritten notes say she said soldiers had “pulled her hair” and a “gun used to beat her” before raping her. Examinations often find injuries suggesting forced penetration, beating and even what looked like intentional cutting of the genitals, doctors said. “We found skin marks, it showed a very forceful attack, an inhuman attack,” said IOM medical officer Dr Tasnuba Nourin. She had seen incidents of vaginal tearing, bite marks and signs that seemed to show a firearm was used to penetrate women, she said. Among the new influx of Rohingya she had treated at least five women who appeared to have been recently raped, she said, adding that in each case the physical injuries observed were consistent with the patient’s account of what had happened. At Bangladesh government clinics supported by U.N. agencies in the Ukhia area, doctors reported treating 19 women who had been raped, said Dr. Misbah Uddin Ahmed, head of the main health complex there, citing reports from female clinicians. “The evidence included bite marks, tearing of the vagina, these sorts of things,” he said. In one day alone, Sept. 14, six women showed up at one of the clinics, all saying they were sexually assaulted. “They all said Myanmar army had done this.” An IOM doctor who asked not to be identified, working at one of those clinics near the Kutapalong refugee camp, said a woman who crossed from Myanmar in late August said she was raped by at least seven soldiers. “She was extremely weak and traumatized and said she struggled to make it to the clinic,” the doctor said. “She had a laceration on the vagina.” The doctor treated 15 of the 19 cases of women who appeared to have been raped, and another eight women who had been physically assaulted. Some were given emergency contraceptives, and all were given treatment to reduce the risk of contracting HIV and jabs against hepatitis. Symptoms included bite marks over the arms and back, tearing and laceration on the vagina and vaginal bleeding, the doctor said. Internal reports compiled by aid agencies in Cox’s Bazar recorded that 49 “SGBV survivors” were identified in just four days between Aug. 28-31. SGBV, or sexual and gender-based violence is used to refer to only cases of rape, according to U.N. doctors. Data for reported rape cases was not available for other dates. A situation report from aid agencies says more than 350 people had been referred for “life-saving care” relating to gender-based violence - a broad term that includes rape, attempted rape and molestation, as well as emotional abuse and denial of resources based on gender - since Aug. 25. It did not refer to the perpetrators. Kate White, emergency medical coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Cox’s Bazar said the charity had treated at least 23 cases of sexual and gender-based violence including gang-rape and sexual assault since Aug. 25. “This is a fraction of the cases that are likely to be out there,” she said. Reuters first reported allegations of mass rape of Rohingya women within days of militant attacks in northern Rakhine in October. The same reports were also heard by U.N. investigators who visited Bangladesh in January. A report of the U.N. Secretary General in April said the sexual assaults were “apparently employed systematically to humiliate and terrorise their community”. Before her rise to power last year Suu Kyi had spoken of rape being used as a tool of division in the country’s myriad ethnic conflicts. “It is used as a weapon by armed forces to intimidate the ethnic nationalities and to divide our country, this is how I see it,” she said in 2011 in a video message to a conference on sexual violence in conflict. Her spokesman Zaw Htay said there was “nothing to say” when asked if her view had changed since then. “Everything should be according to the rule of law,” he said. “The military leaders also have said they will take action.” ","

161,Christina Farr,9282017,CNBC,9212017,"Lyft and the University of Southern California are getting $1 million from insurance giant UnitedHealth to help seniors more easily access the transportation they need. As part of the grant, USC's researchers will study whether taking rides can reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation in seniors and improve their health by helping them get to medical appointments on time. The funds will be used for a pilot program run by the AARP Foundation in Los Angeles. It will provide free Lyft rides to a group of USC Keck Medical Center patients over 60 who have missed at least 2 medical appointments within the past year and have an upcoming appointment on the books. The rides will be available for 3 months. These patients will also receive a Fitbit activity tracker, and are encouraged to log their daily activities. Additional pilots are scheduled for Chicago and Atlanta in 2018. Studies have found that transportation gaps result in many low-income seniors missing or delaying their doctor's visits, which is associated with worse health outcomes. It's also an expensive problem for insurance companies, as these patients are more likely to end up in the emergency room. For Lyft, the business case is clear as it looks to engage new demographics, including seniors, and pick up new sources of revenue in the $6 billion non-emergency medical transportation market. Beyond this specific study, the company is working with a mix of commercial and government insurers will typically foot the bill. ""We want to study whether we can reduce these no-show rates and provide a better experience for elder populations,"" said Lyft's Dan Trigub, who works on health care solutions. Lyft is providing training on how to use the app and it allows a phone-based service for those who lack a smartphone. In that case, the car typically arrives within 30 minutes. Trigub said drivers will be be aware that they need to pickup riders with service animals. That's an issue that got Uber into legal trouble back in 2015. He also said that there's no additional cost for caregivers to join the ride. Ultimately, he said, ""we want to be the premier solution for elder, low-income and underserved populations."" Uber has also made steps into the health and medical market. It ran its own pilot program in 2015 to deliver flu shot packages to workplaces and homes.

162,Dan Mangan,9282017,CNBC,9212017,"Slightly fewer than half of all Americans were vaccinated for the flu last season, a top federal health official warned Thursday, as he called for nearly every person to get a shot by October for the coming season. ""The science on flu vaccination is clear,"" said Dr. Tom Price, secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. ""Vaccination can help prevent you or someone you love from becoming sick and missing school, or work, or worse, becoming severely ill or being hospitalized from or even dying from the flu."" The hospitalization rate last season for influenza was nearly double that of the 2015-2016 season, officials said. Price himself got vaccinated Thursday during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. Tweet He said that for this season, health officials are recommending only injectable vaccines, not nasal spray flu vaccine. ""I urge everyone 6 months and older to do the same as soon as vaccine is available in their community,"" said Price. He noted that next year is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of Spanish flu, which infected a half billion people, and killed up to 5 percent of the world's population. Data released Thursday showed that while there were slight increases in the vaccination rates among people most vulnerable to the flu — adults over age 50 — there were ""mostly stagnant vaccination rates among all age groups,"" according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The flu vaccination rate among all Americans was 48.6 percent last season, up just 1.2 percentage points from the prior season. Among children age 6 months through 23 months, the vaccination rate was 76.3 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the only age group that exceeded the public health goal of 70 percent vaccination coverage, according to NFID. Officials said that for the 2017-2018 season, vaccine manufacturers have estimated that as many as 166 million doses of flu vaccine will be available nationally. More than 73 million doses have already been delivered. The vaccines this season have been modified to protect against the flu viruses that research suggests will be most common in coming months. Price took no questions at the news conference. The health secretary in the past week has come under heavy criticism after the news site Politico revealed he had taken 26 flights on private jets since May, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $400,000. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he is ""not happy"" with Price's use of charter flights. Trump answered, ""We'll see,"" when asked if he would fire Price.

163,John Harwood,9282017,CNBC,9212017,"Flickering hopes to repeal Obamacare this year rest on a simple Republican argument: By the virtues of federalism, states will do it better than Washington. That's how Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy tout their plan to shrink Obamacare spending by $215 billion in 2026 and distribute the reduced amount to states through health-care block grants. Even with less federal cash, the sponsors say, states can improve health care through greater efficiency and appreciation for the needs of their residents. The problem, according to experts on state government, is there's no reason to believe it will work out that way. Evidence doesn't back up the prospect of large efficiency gains. And in significant parts of the country, states have shown themselves unwilling or unable to implement the level of services Obamacare calls for. ""It would be very difficult for many states to be able to do that,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and Cabinet member under President George W. Bush. The current governor, her fellow Republican Chris Christie, opposes Graham-Cassidy on grounds that the projected the loss of $4 billion in federal funds would be ""too injurious"" to New Jersey. Other states that would lose money are also not counting on their superior management to make up the difference. Republican governors such as John Kasich of Ohio, Bill Walker of Alaska and Susana Martinez of New Mexico have broken party ranks to oppose the bill. ""It's going to be impossible for the states to make up the shortfall with greater efficiencies,"" concludes Donald Kettl, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. He points to 2016 data on Medicare, which is administered by the federal government, and Medicaid, administered by the states. Their rates of improper payments — 11 percent and 10.48 percent, respectively — were nearly the same. By design, the Graham-Cassidy block grant formula takes money from states that have shown greater commitment and capacity to improve health care by expanding their Medicaid programs and signing up more people to state-level Obamacare marketplaces. It redistributes the money to states that have shown less commitment and capacity, without prescribing how they have to use it. That design represents the marriage of partisanship to philosophy. States gaining money are mostly governed by the GOP, which favors a smaller government role in health care and other forms of public assistance. For decades, the United States has moved to narrow disparities among states in top-priority services and protections. On health care, it began with the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, and continued more recently with the Children's Health Insurance Program program and Obamacare. Similar shifts toward uniform federal protections took place in other realms, such as the safeguards of the Clean Air Act of 1963, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The nation decided, as Kettl puts it, that ""If we wait for the states, we're never going to get there."" If Graham-Cassidy were enacted, big differences among state political cultures would widen state-by-state differences in the quality of health services, predicts Richard Nathan, a leading authority on federalism at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. At a time when information technology gives Americans increasingly common national experiences in commerce and culture, Nathan calls such a move ""incomprehensible."" ""It is, to me, incredible that this is being seriously considered,"" said Nathan, who advised Republican President Richard Nixon as a top budget aide. He advocates both near-term stabilization of existing Obamacare marketplaces and longer-term tax policy shifts to reduce health costs nationally. Whitman cites public opposition to an Obamacare repeal as a sign her party ""would be wise"" to accept the federal government's health-care role. She wants Congress to set aside the Graham-Cassidy proposal and resume bipartisan talks on improving marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. ""On any issue this big and this complex, it needs to have everybody at the table,"" Whitman said. ""It would make for much better legislation.""

165,Diana Olick,9282017,CNBC,9212017,"From a broad view, the U.S. housing market looks very healthy. Demand is high, employment and wages are growing, and mortgage rates are low. But the nation's housing market is assuredly unhealthy; in fact, it is increasingly mismatched with today's buyers. While the big numbers don't lie, they don't tell the real truth about the affordability and availability of U.S. housing for the bulk of would-be buyers. First, several reports out this week point to both continued heat in home values as well as pushback from homebuyers. Prices remain nearly 6 percent higher than they were a year ago, nationally, with some local markets seeing double-digit annual price gains. Those prices are being driven by a severe lack of supply at the low end of the market, which is where the most demand exists. That means lower-priced homes are seeing bigger price gains than higher-priced homes because of the competition. At the same time, sales are falling, again, because there are too few homes on the low end, and the homes that are available are very expensive. ""It sets up a situation in which the housing market looks largely healthy from a 50,000-foot view, but on the ground, the situation is much different, especially for younger, first-time buyers and/or buyers of more modest means,"" wrote Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow in a response to the latest home-price data. ""Supply is low in general, but half of what is available to buy is priced in the top one-third of the market."" Supply on the low end is tight because during the housing crash investors large and small bought hundreds of thousands of foreclosed properties and turned them into rentals. There are currently 8 million more renter-occupied homes than there were in 2007, the peak of the housing boom, according to the U.S. Census. Investors could take the opportunity of high prices and high demand to sell these properties, but today's high rents offer them better returns. Low supply of homes for sale might also seem like a great opportunity for the nation's homebuilders. Yes, they went through an epic housing crash, but they have since consolidated market share and righted their balance sheets. Homebuilders are simply not building enough inexpensive houses that the market needs. That is why sales of newly built homes, like existing homes, have been disappointing. The latest read on August new home sales from the U.S. Census surprised analysts with a 3.4 percent monthly drop, along with a rise in inventory. The homes are there, they're just not selling, and it's not hard to figure out why. ""The recent home sales data has reflected a slower pace and I continue to believe it's due to more a push back on pricing,"" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst with the Lindsey Group, in a response to the data release. Just 2 percent of newly built homes sold in August were priced under $150,000, and just 14 percent priced under $200,000. Compare that with the existing home market, where more than half of homes sold in August were priced under $250,000. Builders say they would like to build more affordable homes but cannot because the math doesn't work. The costs of land, labor, materials and regulatory compliance are just too high. In addition, younger homebuyers want to live closer to urban areas, not in the far-out exurbs, where builder costs are far lower. ""It's time we stopped sugarcoating the truth with this data — the simple fact is that we are severely underproducing housing in this country, relative both to basic demographics and currently high demand from buyers,"" wrote Gudell, who notes that inventory is stuck at roughly mid-1990s levels, but the country has grown by more than 60 million people since then. ""Buying conditions, in theory, are great right now: Jobs and incomes are growing, and rock-bottom mortgage interest rates are helping keep financing costs low. What's missing from the equation is a lack of homes actually available to buy at a price point that's reasonable for most buyers."" The trouble is, even though the market is woefully mismatched, home prices will not come down as long as there are some buyers out there willing and able to spend more and more money for less and less house. ""We expect price pressure to remain pretty strong well into the fall,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin. ""First-time buyers are struggling to find a footing in this market. The first-time buyer share is down from historical levels, but the thing is, you don't need everyone to buy a house in this market. As long as there are one or two buyers who can afford, and those buyers can be investors, then the sale will go through, and that's what we're seeing at some level."" So, what does all this mean for the economy and personal wealth? It means the renter nation will persist and fewer Americans will be able to save and grow their money in a home. It also means rents will continue to rise due to high demand, leaving more Americans with less disposable income to spend. In other words, it's not healthy.

Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi declined 0.26 percent to finish the session at 2,374.32 as geopolitical tensions weighed, although the index was off lows touched earlier in the session. Blue chip tech stocks sold off following Wall Street's lead. Samsung Electronics closed down 3.66 percent, SK Hynix tumbled 4.87 percent and LG Electronics fell 2.97 percent. Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 slid 0.22 percent to end at 5,671. The 1.91 percent gain in the energy sub-index was offset by losses in retailers.

The broader MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index was 0.37 percent lower by 3:30 p.m. HK/SIN. Geopolitical tensions came to the fore again overnight after North Korea's foreign minister said U.S. President Donald Trump had declared war. Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that meant the North could target and shoot down U.S. bombers in return. The White House responded that the U.S. had not declared war on the hermit state late on Monday. The ramp up in saber-rattling followed Trump's speech at the United Nations last week, where the president had warned that if forced, the U.S. would have ""no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."" Safe haven assets were buoyed, with spot gold remaining above the $1,300 level reached overnight. The yellow metal, often regarded as a safe haven in times of geopolitical uncertainty, was mostly unchanged from overnight levels at $1,309.42 an ounce at 2:55 p.m. HK/SIN compared with the $1,290 handle most of last week. The Japanese currency extended overnight gains to trade at 111.59 yen to the dollar after trading at the 112 handle during Asian trade on Monday. The yen had firmed slightly following the release of the Bank of Japan's July minutes on Tuesday. The minutes indicated policymakers were optimistic about consumer prices, with some stating that a 2 percent inflation target was a global standard, Reuters said. Markets stateside were jittery on Monday, with a fall in technology stocks adding to declines in major indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.24 percent, or 53.5 points, to close at 22,296.09. Analysts said North Korea's accusation that Trump had declared war had made markets nervous. ""The comments have taken the wind out of the sails just when risk was looking fairly upbeat as we headed into Europe, despite the uncertainty around the elections. That said, it's hardly panic selling and the moves look measured and contained,"" said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG. Elsewhere, the euro was mostly flat after retreating following the German election on Sunday. While provisional results showed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party had the most votes, she will likely face a tough coalition negotiation. Support for a far-right party was also larger than expected. The common currency traded at $1.1848 at 2:57 p.m. HK/SIN, around its lowest levels since late August. Also in politics, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday he would be dissolving the lower house of parliament on Sept. 28 ahead of a snap election expected on Oct. 22, Reuters said. Investors also digested comments from New York Fed President William Dudley and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Dudley said Monday that the central bank was on the path to slowly increasing interest rates as ""temporary"" factors affecting inflation faded, Reuters said. Evans adopted a more cautious tone, stating that the Fed had to wait for marked signs that prices were increasing before raising rates. In corporate news, the sale of Toshiba's memory chip unit to a group led by Bain Capital for $18 billion had yet to be signed, according to Reuters. Toshiba had informed its banks on Monday that Apple, which is part of the consortium, had not agreed with conditions in the sale. Toshiba stock finished the session lower by 0.66 percent. Apple suppliers in Asia were lower after the tech giant saw its shares fall around 0.9 percent on Monday. Apple had reportedly informed suppliers to reduce shipments for one of its latest models, the iPhone X, Reuters reported. Taiwan-listed suppliers finished the session lower: Hon Hai Precision Industry closed down 1.43 percent and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company slid 1.38 percent. Samsung Electronics fell along most other South Korean tech stocks, while Hong Kong's AAC Technologies Holding fell 1.1 percent by 2:58 p.m. HK/SIN. On the energy front, oil prices were a touch lower after rising more than 3 percent overnight. Brent crude lost 0.12 percent to trade at $58.95 a barrel after its highest levels in more than 2 years earlier. U.S. crude was off 0.23 percent at $52.10.

168,"SurveyMonkey's Jon Cohen, chief research officer, and Laura Wronski, research scientist",9282017,CNBC,9212017,"President Trump's tax-reform proposal calls for cutting the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, emphasizing the need ""to help the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy."" The plan the GOP leadership is expected to reveal on Wednesday is still unknown, though there has been talk of a reduction to 20 percent in the corporate rate, not the 15 percent Trump wanted. Either way, small-business owners in the latest CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey have only tepid expectations about tax reform ahead. Not even a third of them expect changes in tax policy to give their businesses a boost, and just about as many anticipate tax policy changes being a drag on their operations (31 percent expect positive changes; 27 percent negative ones). A narrow, 40 percent plurality don't expect such reform to have much of an impact at all. The lukewarm outlook runs counter to the broader support Trump gets among small-business owners, nearly half of whom (47 percent) report paying effective tax rates in excess of 15 percent last year. Another complicating factor: Nearly a quarter of all small-business owners indicated they didn't even know how to bucket their effective tax rate. After all, it's complicated, which is part of the point of reform. One reason for gaps in perceived tax burdens is the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate — in simpler terms, the tax rate as it is written in the law and the tax rate that corporations actually pay after deductions are taken off, while state taxes are added on. Few corporations pay an effective tax rate as high as their statutory rate. According to a 2013  Congressional Budget Office analysis, the effective tax rate for corporations in the United States is 18.6 percent, significantly less than the 35 percent cap. More from the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey:Main Street confidence in Trump slips, even among conservatives
Main Street hopes for tax-reform boom decline For example, small businesses with fewer than 25 employees may qualify for the  Small Business Health Care Tax Credit, which incentivizes employers to provide health care for their employees. Among small-business owners, ""taxes"" and the ""cost of employee health care"" are named as the top two most critical issues facing their businesses (mentioned by 22 percent and 18 percent of small-business owners, respectively). These competing demands may create a trade-off for small-business owners deciding how to best balance their accounts while providing for their employees. The new data comes from the quarterly CNBC/SurveyMonkey, which interviewed 2,282 small-business owners from Aug. 10–17. In a recent interview, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that small businesses can have effective  tax rates as high as 44.6 percent and spoke of the need to relieve some of that tax burden. That statistic may be true of a few small businesses, but not the vast majority. In our survey, the same proportion of small-business owners reported effective business tax rates at either extreme: 7 percent say their effective tax rate is 0 percent; 7 percent say their effective tax rate is greater than 35 percent. However, those business owners who fall into that top 7 percent have a lot to gain if Trump's tax-reform proposals are enacted, and they are appropriately the most optimistic at such a prospect. A clear majority (59 percent) of small-business owners in this tax bracket expect changes in tax policy to have a positive effect on their businesses in the next 12 months. They are also more likely than anyone else to name ""taxes"" as the most critical issue facing their businesses (35 percent do so, compared to just 6 percent of small-business owners with an effective tax rate of 0 percent). Trump's approval rating is highest among these small-business owners who have the most to gain from tax reform. Nearly 3 in 4 small-business owners (73 percent) who have the highest effective tax rates say they approve of the way Trump is handling his presidency. For comparison, just 41 percent of small-business owners whose businesses have effective tax rates of zero percent approve of Trump, as do only 35 percent of those whose businesses are taxed at 1 percent to 10 percent. Though this group represents a small proportion of small-business owners overall, they stand to reap outsized benefit if tax reform actually passes. — SurveyMonkey's Jon Cohen, chief research officer, and Laura Wronski, research scientist The CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey is conducted quarterly using  SurveyMonkey's online platform and based on its survey methodology.

It took until last week for the central bank to actually issue those statements and formally make the requests. It seems like, you know, a lot of people would have thought, a lot of our viewers were surprised that that hadn't been done long long ago as part of previous sanctions. Do you feel assured or what insurances do you have that on the trade front on your part on your mandate that they're cooperating. Wilbur Ross: On the sanctions side we've been gradually ramping them up. So this was a logical next step in the sanctions. And a very very important one because the Chinese commercial banks had been a big route for facilitation of trade to North Korea. So the fact that the PBOC which is the central bank has really put out a taboo. That's a very big deal. AF: There's Chinese customs data that came out that showed Pyongyang earned more coal export income in August than in January or February. Certainly the Chinese buying this up. This of course came before the latest UN sanctions. Doesn't that show that China is not entirely on board in cooperating in cracking down on North Korea. Wilbur Ross: I think what you need to do is to look forward rather than backward. And that's a gigantic step for the PBOC step. So assuming that it's followed through and assuming that the other parts of the sanctions are followed through that's a very good sign. It's very very important pressure. AF: So looking forward, what is the measure for the administration on the effectiveness of the sanctions. You've got the sanctions in place now at what point do you, can you determine that they have been effective in not just clamping down on North Korea's economy but the weapons program itself? Wilbur Ross: Well remember the sanctions are an end in themselves, they're a means to an end. What we're hoping will happen is that this will bring a sensible resolution of the situation over there. BL: We have talked a lot about you know what China can do on the official front versus the you know the unofficial economy. There's a great deal of trade, there's a great deal of, you know, don't want to a black market necessarily but, you know, unofficial transactions that go on. Were those discussed at all? Did you bring those up with the Chinese? Wilbur Ross: No, my mission is not that. My mission was the pure trade parts and trying to get organized for the president's visit. BL: You say you, you know obviously we want as say look forward not backward at the past history but what can be done in the future. This is what we have right now. But you know between the U.S. and China President Xi Jinping has made a great deal about you know ahead the 19th Congress he'll talk more about it. But about Made in China 2025 and which you know very well what that means. And as the narrative goes you know foreign participation the Chinese economy is always a difficult difficult juggernaut. I mean foreign content, the rules on partnering, that sort of thing. The narrative is that the PRC by 2025 wants to use automation and higher technology to boot out foreign participation, particularly Americans from the internal economy. Wilbur Ross: Well I think that's going a little further than 2025 actually. When I don't think they named America as such in the 2025 but clearly they want to become more self-sufficient in areas like semiconductors of which they are the world's largest consumer. We don't mind competition. We just want the competition to be on a fair and level playing field. And that means not so much in the way of trade barriers. Not so much in the way of protectionist activities. Not so much in the way of impediments to companies operating there. Not so much in the way of forced technology trends through things of that sort. BL: But we know that we know that the game is stacked. We know that China games this playing field in their own favor. And yet from 2002 until last year there were 38 cases involving force transfer of technology IP infringement filed against China. There were 78 filed by various countries around the world against the United States in that same time. Why is that? It sounds like a WTO was not designed for modern China. Wilbur Ross: Well I don't think the WTO was designed necessarily for the modern trade world especially China but all parts of it. It's an archaic system. Remember this is the outgrowth of GATT which came into effect right after World War 2. That point in time the U.S. had concentrated surpluses and had made a very basic policy decision to help Asian and European countries recover from the ravages of World War 2. Problem is the things that were put in place with WTO back then haven't been changed. But it's very hard to say that China as now the world's second largest economy needs the same sort of preferential treatment that might have justified to have decades ago. AF: Let me ask you about the administration's investigation into steel dumping because there are reports that suggest the president rejected a proposal that would have led - the proposal from China that would have led to significant cuts and steel overcapacity which is something that you had endorsed. What specifically is the administration's seeking on this issue? Wilbur Ross: Well what we're seeking is an overall improvement in trade. And if you look at our trade balance, there's one geographic source of our imbalance and that's most importantly China. And there's one product source of our imbalance and that's mostly automobiles. Now the automobiles are not particularly from China. China is not yet exporting any meaningful number of cars especially not to U.S. If you solve the geographic problem and you solve the product problem you've pretty well solved our trade problem. AF: This is of course a complex issue that comes at a very tentious time over in the U.S. as you're trying to push forward with tax reform. Is the administration willing to table some of these trade issues that perhaps some Republicans are not onboard with in order to get them onboard with tax reform. Wilbur Ross: Well President Trump has made it clear that he's delayed this deal and some other events in trade in order to clear the decks so we don't have anything that confuses people while we try to get the tax thing. The tax program is the single most important thing after, obviously the budget and the lifting of the debt ceiling, but going forward the tax reform is important. Why. If you work it right it will increase the GDP growth by one percentage points, so 100 basis points. What does that mean over 10 years. Ten trillion dollars more GDP. 3 trillion dollars more revenues to the federal government. Those are gigantic numbers even for a country the size of the U.S. So the tax changes could be transformative events. BL: When you talk about tax reform, when you talk about tax reform repatriation of overseas you know bundles of cash, there are a lot of American MNCs have it's a very big part of the conversation. Wilbur Ross: Oh yes. And it's a very important objective. We believe that there will be a vast amount of it brought back if the president's notion of a very reduced rate on the immediate repatriation is goes through. So that's a very important part of our tax reform. And then the last important part is individual tax reform. Both rates not so much with the high end but for the middle and lower people. And simplification. Guess how many hours Americans spend filling up their tax returns each year, 6 billion. Imagine how much better an economy we'd have been if those 6 billion hours were devoted to productive activity, not trying to figure out the meaning of a 100 page tax instruction form. AF: And very quickly, is 15 percent corporate tax rate pretty much off the table? Are we looking at a low 20 percent? Wilbur Ross: We've not made an announcement. President Trump has indicated his goal and his hope would be to get as close to the 15 percent as we possibly can. PART 2 BL: Secretary, want to ask you, the whole issue, you know, one of the first things the president did was say ok out of TPP. Everybody else is coalescing. China tried to take the mantle at that point to say, we are holding the mantle, we are the shining light of free trade and all that. Is there a rethink, is there some sort of reformation or a rethink going through the administration right now whether it's really good to isolate the U.S. or give the impression that the U.S. is isolating itself from so many things in the world. Wilbur Ross: That was never our intention to isolate ourselves. That's the fiction that the media had invented. The idea though because we didn't think TPP was an advantageous deal for the United States. So we rejected the deal, not the geography. And if you notice, since the election and since the inauguration Vice President Pence and I were in Japan, he's going back again shortly. I'm over here now going through China, through Hong Kong, through Thailand, through Laos. We've got all kinds of people out here. And that's partly to show quite visibly that we're not forsaking the region at all. The region is hugely important to us. So it's different to say you're rejecting a particular contract from saying we're rejecting the region. Take for example NAFTA we're certainly not rejecting Mexico and Canada we're just saying we think the commercial arrangements with them need to be reformed. AF: The intention is not isolation but as Bernie pointed out we have seen several multilateral trade deals going forward. TPP 11 of course looking to get signed by November. We've got RCEP led by China. We've got the Japan Europe free trade deal that's still being hammered out. I mean this is a trade bloc that would be equivalent to NAFTA. Do those deals come at the expense of the US? Wilbur Ross: I don't think so because we after all are the largest of those import markets. So the trading position that we have, the need for these other countries to get better access to our market, those continue. Plus I would point out those deals have not been finalized. Those are deals under discussion. Big difference between discussion and finalization. And then when they do get finalized. Big question is well what do they really mean. What are the real provisions that are going into effect. BL: Pandora's Box, I mean to use an analogy that's been opened here by revisiting NAFTA after all these years. This morning you came armed with your cell with you. Announcement of commerce you know issuing countervailing duties against mid-sized aircraft made in Canada. There's only one aircraft maker I know in Canada and that's Bombardier and they make 100 to 150 seaters. This wouldn't have happened in the past, would it? Wilbur Ross: Oh sure. This is unrelated to NAFTA. There have been trade complaints back and forth ever since NAFTA was started. The Bombardier thing is very specific. It says the Boeing Company brought an action which we're now processing. Their actions said that the Quebec and the Canadian government illegally subsidize the development of that aircraft. So what came out today was our preliminary determination that that was the case. Now there are a couple more procedural steps so it will be some months before a final determination is made. But this with or without NAFTA this kind of action would have been brought. AF: There are several changes that the administration is taking in NAFTA. One of them is stricter rules of origin. I'm wondering what concessions the U.S. is willing to make to get there. Would you for example or would the administration for example be willing to back off on arbitration panels. Wilbur Ross: Well those are whole complicated issues. The day to day, the negotiations as you know are being handled by the U.S. trade rep. and I think it'd be very tricky for me to comment on bids that haven't been announced while everything is still being negotiated. Because you don't have a deal and anything till you have a deal on everything. AF: Let me follow up very quickly on TPP 11 because Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan has made it very clear that they are leading this deal in the hopes that the U.S. will eventually come back to the table. You pointed out that you weren't against TPP 11 multi trade deal per se, it was more about the conditions. Under what conditions would the U.S. be willing to come back to the table on that? Wilbur Ross: Well again we felt that we were giving up much more than we were getting in. And it's much more complicated than we can deal with this morning. It's thousands of page agreement but that's fundamentally the issue that we had with the TPP before. But regardless of who had won the election TPP was dead. There was no political will power either in the Democratic side or the Republican side to go ahead with TPP. So it's a little silly to call that an act by the Trump administration. We administered the coup de gras but it was going to happen in any event. BL: Mr. Secretary is there a, you know, the administration is going on what, 10 month old now. AF: End of September. BL: Yeah 10 months. You know when you signed on for the job, you were coming from private industry. You were a very happy, very successful person on your own. You didn't need this. Wilbur Ross: Well I'm still very happy. BL: OK. I'm glad to know that, I'm really glad, I'm so happy to know that, but because you know we've seen a lot of people come and go it's been a revolving door in many cases you know with a lot of people that were there at the start, gone. But I mean when you signed up for the job did you expect to be here almost a year into the job? And may I add to that. Is there some sort of a, I think everybody in this part of the world wants to know, Trump is in the news every day and if it's not one thing, it's the other. You know he is fighting the NFL for kneeling you know or for sitting during the anthem while he's trying to take on North Korea. Is there some sort of end game, is there some sort of method to the, I could use for lack of a better word, chaos. Wilbur Ross: Well first of all, I don't think there is chaos. Any time you have a new administration particularly a shift from one party that had been in the administration for eight years to another one. You're bound to have a lot of new faces come in. And with hundreds of people with high testosterone coming into the White House the idea that there would be a little pulling and tugging surely is not a strange idea. So that's normal to administrations. What's a little unusual here is it's so public. And the reason it's so public is, the media are intensely focused on Washington now more than I think ever and frankly a lot of the media folks still can't get over the fact that President Trump in fact is the president, is going to be the president, I hope for eight years, not just four. AF: Well you've also got a president who is tweeting on a daily basis. That's partly why some of these thoughts are so public. I mean. I wonder you know, you came in this in January, you're nine months into the job have things moved along a little slower than you expected and how frustrating is it on a daily basis. Yes the media can be focused on it but the reality is the president is sending out mixed messages. How frustrating is it to see those distractions. Because in the end it's derailing from the core goal here and the legislative agenda. Wilbur Ross: Well I don't think it's derailing from the core goal. One disappointment has been Congress's inability to come to conclusions on health care. And we hope that's not a warning sign that they'll have equal problems with other pieces of legislation. The administration's been moving ahead. We've brought 48 percent more trade cases this year than we did last year. ","CNBC Transcript: Wilbur Ross, U.S. Secretary of Commerce",0.9997
170,Ali Montag,9282017,CNBC,9212017,"North Korea's dictator Kim Jong Un and the United States President Donald Trump are at odds. Over recent weeks, rhetoric surrounding North Korea's nuclear ambitions has been intensifying. Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department heightened the tensions by implementing economic sanctions, according to the Treasury. As the two leaders become more deeply entangled, expert Chris Voss tells CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that both have distinct approaches to negotiation. Voss is an expert in persuasion and served as the lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI until 2008, according to his website. Before that, he was the lead crisis negotiator for the New York City division of the FBI and a member of the New York City Joint Terrorist Task Force. He's also the founder of business consulting company, The Black Swan Group. Here's what he sees in each leader's style. Voss sums up Trump's style as assertive. ""He's actually the kind of negotiator that as a hostage negotiator I had to learn how to get the upper hand on, without making them mad, without making it worse,"" he explains. Voss calls Trump ""an assertive, openly aggressive negotiator."" And the problem with that style, explains Voss, is that ""people get tired of dealing with them."" As an example, Voss points to Trump's recent openness to working with Democrats on policy projects like tax reform and health care. ""The reason why he's going to the Democrats is because Republicans are tired of him,"" Voss says. A negotiating tactic that works better is deference, says Voss. ""You know, I can say, 'You have to give me this,' in a demanding way or I can say, 'Look, if we don't put this on the table we can't make a deal.' ""There is great power in deference,"" he says. ""Deference works with everybody."" As for North Korea's leader, who has a tendency toward self importance, with someone like that you should ask ""what does he see in the future that he wants?"" Voss says. ""I want to pick a place in the future that you're going to like, that I want to take you to,"" he says. If both sides can agree on that, ""Now, you're going to be a little bit more cooperative."" More from iCONIC: ",Ex-FBI agent on what you can learn about negotiating from Donald Trump,0.8372
171,Keith Speights,9282017,Fool,9212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett is, without question, one of the greatest investors of all time. Over the past 50 years, the company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), has generated compounded average annual returns of 20.8% -- trouncing the S&P 500. However, the oracle of Omaha hasn't beaten the market nearly as much in recent years. One reason why just might be Buffett's greatest weakness: He hasn't been very good at investing in healthcare. Image source: Getty Images. Warren Buffett once famously stated, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" Looking at Berkshire Hathaway's investments in the 21st century, however, shows that Buffett hasn't always appeared to be willing to own healthcare stocks for 10 years. He probably wishes he had. For example, Buffett added large health insurance stock UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) to Berkshire's portfolio in late 2006. In early 2007, Berkshire bought another health insurer, Wellpoint, which later became Anthem.By the first quarter of 2010, though, Buffett had sold both stocks. We don't know the exact date when Berkshire bought its positions in the two health-insurance stocks. However, it's a certainty that Buffett lost by double-digit percentages on both positions. He might have lost more than 30% on UnitedHealth Group. But just look at how both stocks have performed compared with Berkshire Hathaway stock since the end of the first quarter of 2010 -- after Buffett sold Anthem (Wellpoint) and UnitedHealth Group. UNH data by YCharts Both of the stocks that Buffett wasn't willing to hold onto for 10 years went on to greatly outperform his own company's stock. UnitedHealth Group nearly quadrupled Berkshire's gains during the period after Buffett sold his shares in the health insurer. But that's not the only time Buffett threw in the towel too early on a healthcare stock. In the third quarter of 2011, Berkshire bought CVS Caremark stock, now known as CVS Health. By the second quarter of 2012, less than a year later, Berkshire no longer owned the giant pharmacy-services company. Buffett probably made a profit on CVS Health stock, but he forfeited additional gains of close to 70% if he had kept his shares. Berkshire Hathaway currently owns three healthcare stocks: DaVita (NYSE:DVA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Sanofi. Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi have been in Berkshire's portfolio since 2006, while DaVita was added in 2011. At first glance, you might think it's good that at least Buffett has retained some healthcare stocks for the long term rather than selling too early. There's more to the story, though. Buffett drastically cut his position in J&J in 2012 by roughly 95%. At the time, he was quoted as saying the company had ""some wonderful products and a wonderful balance sheet, but too many mistakes have been made."" Those mistakes primarily referred to several J&J product recalls. You probably know where this is going. Had Buffett held on to his J&J stock, his initial large stake in the healthcare giant would have nearly doubled. With dividends included, Johnson & Johnson would have beaten Berkshire's performance in the period following Buffett's big sell-off. What about the two healthcare stocks for which Buffett hasn't slashed his positions? Sanofi has generated stock returns in the single-digit percentages at best over the 11 years it's been in Berkshire's portfolio. Dividends make the overall return look better, but Sanofi has still greatly underperformed Berkshire during the period. As for DaVita, Buffett didn't sell shares of the dialysis services provider but instead added to his position over several years. However, like most of his other healthcare investments, it hasn't turned out all that great, either. DaVita stock has been on a general decline since 2015. Since Berkshire added DaVita, its returns have badly trailed both Berkshire stock and the S&P 500. BRK.A data by YCharts Warren Buffett is a very wealthy man, but he'd probably be much wealthier -- as would Berkshire Hathaway shareholders -- if he had made better decisions on healthcare stocks. If Berkshire's having added no new healthcare holdings in the past five years is any indication, it could be that Buffett will decide to avoid healthcare entirely in the future. On the other hand, Buffett is a smart man and no doubt realizes the potential for the healthcare industry. With the baby boomer generation aging, demand for healthcare services will definitely rise. New healthcare technologies hold the potential to generate fortunes for astute investors. It only takes one big winner to make all the losing stocks in an investment portfolio seem irrelevant. That's been the case for Buffett overall. He once said, ""What we learn from history is that people don't learn from history."" Warren Buffett is a student of history. Don't underestimate his ability to learn from his past mistakes. ","
      
    Could This Be Warren Buffett's Greatest Weakness? -- The Motley Fool

172,Sean Williams,9282017,Fool,9212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In just over five weeks, open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is best known as Obamacare, will begin. The upcoming enrollment period could very well rival the first enrollment period (Oct. 2013 – March 2014) as the most challenging yet, given the uncertainties surrounding what might happen to now-former President Barack Obama's hallmark healthcare legislation. Currently, Republicans are working on last-ditch efforts to repeal and replace the ACA before October 1. Once the new fiscal year hits for the federal government, the possibility of using reconciliation as a tool to repeal Obamacare will come off the table until around March of next year. Reconciliation allows lawmakers to pass bills that have a direct impact on the federal budget with a simple majority vote (51%) as opposed to getting the required 60% of votes needed to make a repeal and replace of Obamacare permanent. Should the ACA be repealed via reconciliation, the new law would sunset in 10 years, reinstituting Obamacare. Image source: Obama White House via Flickr. With the GOP in control of the legislative branches of government, but having no luck thus far in coming to a consensus on what should replace Obamacare, uncertainty reigns. And this uncertainty is just one of many factors that could very well push your Obamacare premium through the roof in 2018. ACASignUps.net has calculated out an average requested increase in premiums next year of 16.22%, assuming the Trump administration doesn't make any drastic changes to the current program. Here's a running list of all the reasons your health insurance premium under Obamacare is probably going to rise by a double-digit percentage in 2018. Image source: President Donald J. Trump's official Facebook page. Photo by Shealah Craighead. Arguably the biggest boost to premiums is derived from the uncertainty surrounding whether or not President Trump will ""go nuclear"" on Obamacare. You see, back in 2014 the GOP sued then head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, over the disbursement of cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) to individuals and families earning between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level. Their argument was that only Congress can apportion funding for CSRs, which help lower the cost of copays, coinsurance, and deductibles tied with a medical visit, and that this apportioning was never properly made. In 2016, a federal judge agreed and gave Republicans the legal victory they'd been waiting for. However, the verdict has been stayed by an appeal that began with the Obama administration and has continued under Trump's tenure. On one hand, continuing to pay CSRs allows 7 million low-income folks the ability to affordably head to the doctor. On the other hand, Trump wants the ACA repealed, and dropping the appeal to this case would end CSR funding. If that were to happen, these lower-income folks would either choose not to go to the doctor, or they'd stiff insurers with the bill. Either way, it'd be bad news for insurers and consumers. This uncertainty is bound to boost rates big time in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. An even more recent issue for the ACA is the announcement from the Trump administration that it would be cutting outreach funding by 90% ($100 million to $10 million) and navigator funding by 41%, for the upcoming enrollment period. The Trump administration justified the cuts by suggesting that navigators haven't been reaching their enrollment goals, while the 90% gutting to the marketing budget for the ACA is simply par for the course on a program the GOP would rather see gone. While it's tough to pinpoint the exact impact of a major reduction in the marketing expenses tied to the ACA, the expectation is that fewer folks will realize they have options under Obamacare, including the possibility of premium and CSR subsidies. This should result in a reduction of ACA enrollment, which could disincentive insurers from offering plans on the ACA exchanges in the future. Image source: Getty Images. Another concern for the upcoming year is that the Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) will once again not incentivize younger, healthier adults to enroll. The SRP is the penalty that individuals are supposed to pay for not purchasing health insurance during the year, and last year it was the greater of $695 or 2.5% of modified adjusted gross income. According to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation in Dec. 2015, the estimated SRP for a household in 2016 was $969. Here's the issue: While the average SRP might be close to $1,000, the average bronze-tier plan cost an unsubsidized individual more than $3,700 across the U.S. in 2017, per HealthPocket. Healthy adults could choose to remain uninsured and save themselves around $2,700 for the year. What's more, Trump signed an executive order in January easing the burdens of Obamacare, which allows taxpayers to submit their return without filling in information regarding their SRP payments during the year. In other words, healthy adults have little incentive to enroll, which hurts any shot insurers have of being profitable. Image source: Getty Images. Higher premiums can also be blamed on insurers, which have been leaving the ACA exchanges in droves. Simple economics would suggest that the more supply you have, the greater chance of competitive pricing. Therefore, the more insurers there are operating in a state or county, the more choice consumers will have to buy a plan that matches their budget. In 2014 and 2015, this wasn't an issue since insurers flocked to Obamacare's exchanges fully expecting tens of millions of enrollees. By 2017, though, we began to witness an exodus as losses from the ACA mounted for national insurers. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest national insurer, wound up slashing its coverage from 34 states in 2016 to just three in 2017, while Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which had their merger plans denied by regulators, slashed their county-based coverage by nearly 70% and almost 90%, respectively, in 2017. More recently, Aetna and Humana both announced that they were pulling out of the ACA's exchanges entirely for the upcoming year. Even Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), the company behind the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand in 14 markets, is cutting back on its coverage in 2018. Fewer options mean higher prices for consumers. Image source: Getty Images. Building off of the previous point, the failure of the risk corridor has also compromised any incentive for competition among insurers. The risk corridor was a fund designed to collect money from overly profitable insurers, and then divvy that money out to insurers with excessive losses that had priced their premiums too low. It was critically underfunded from the get-go since there weren't many profitable insurers (an issue caused by enrolling too many sick folks and not enough healthy adults), leaving insurers to deal with their losses on their own. The result? Out of the 23 approved healthcare cooperatives (co-ops), three-quarters have already shut their doors. These co-ops were a critical source of low-cost premiums designed to attract younger adults without a lot of disposable income. Without many of these co-ops in place, there's even less incentive for young adults to enroll. Image source: Getty Images. You can also expect that your Obamacare premium is going to skyrocket in 2018 because your states' Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) has very little power. An OIC is designed to be an intermediary between the insurer and the consumer, much in the way a pharmacy-benefits manager acts an intermediary between a drugmaker and an insurance company to lower drug costs. Insurers looking for a rate hike (or decrease) of 10% or higher are required to submit those requests to a states' OIC, along with the reasoning that explains the need for the rate hike (or decline). Ideally, that OIC is supposed to negotiate with insurers on behalf of the consumer to push premium prices as low as is reasonable. Unfortunately, OICs have virtually no power to persuade insurers to lower their premiums, paving the way for ""reasonable"" double-digit rate hikes. Image source: Getty Images. Last, but not least, we can point at prescription drug costs for some of the expected increase in 2018. We've thankfully witnessed weaker generic drug pricing power of late, but specialty drug costs, such as those that fight diabetes and cancer, have generally been rising by around 10% a year. If there is a silver lining to higher prescription drug prices, it's that their list prices aren't what insurers are paying, and therefore not what they're trying to pass along to consumers. Usually, pharmacy-benefit managers are able to reduce prescription drug costs significantly (around half, give or take a bit in each direction, and depending on the drug and indication). Nevertheless, higher drug costs only incentivize insurers to push their premiums higher. No matter how we look at Obamacare in 2018, your premium costs are probably going to be significantly higher.

    7 Reasons Your Obamacare Premium Could Soar by a Double-Digit Percentage in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

173,Sean Williams,9282017,Fool,9212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. These growth figures have also been backed by a notable shift in consumer opinion toward legalizing pot. In 1995, the year before California legalized medicinal cannabis for compassionate use, just 25% of those surveyed by Gallup wanted to see it legalized for adult use across the United States. But by October 2016, approval for the idea of a national legalization had spiked to 60%, an all-time high. Image source: Getty Images. At the other end the spectrum, the U.S. federal government continues to make life challenging for the industry and marijuana stocks in general. A Schedule I categorization for cannabis means it has no recognized medical benefits, placing it on par with heroin and LSD. This scheduling means that weed-based companies are unable to take corporate income tax deductions like normal businesses, nor are they often able to secure basic financial services like a checking account or line of credit. It's also exceptionally difficult for research companies to secure cannabis in order to run risk-versus-benefit studies that have the potential to alter marijuana's scheduling. These inherent disadvantages for the legal weed industry put its companies in quite the bind. They're often stuck dealing with cash, which comes with growth restraints, and they're being forced to pay tax on their gross profits rather than their net profits, leaving less cash left over. That means less in the way of growth opportunities and hiring. Because marijuana is an illegal substance at the federal level, the pot industry also faces challenges within legal states. Individual jurisdictions usually have the right to dictate whether a dispensary is allowed to open within a city or county. The result, as we've witnessed in Colorado, can be something of a Swiss-cheese-like legalization effort, where weed is unwelcome in more jurisdictions than welcome. Image source: Getty Images. However, Nevada is hoping to be a trailblazer of sorts on the marijuana front and turn this latter disadvantage on its head. The Silver State, which only voted to legalize recreational weed in the November 2016 elections, and began selling the product to adults ages 21 and up this past July, is tinkering with the idea of becoming the first state to legally allow pot lounges where consumers can smoke cannabis products in a public place. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska only allow cannabis to be smoked in the privacy of one's residence, while California, Maine, and Massachusetts, the three other recreational marijuana states, have yet to begin selling adult-use weed. According to a report from The Hill, Nevada's Legislative Counsel Bureau noted last week that its state law does not prohibit city or county governments from operating lounges where consumers can use marijuana. Considering how popular Nevada and more specifically Las Vegas are for tourists, the addition of marijuana lounges or cafes could dramatically boost tourism to the state. For instance, a late 2015 study commissioned by the Colorado Tourism Office found that marijuana played a big role in boosting tourism to the state. The survey revealed that of those folks planning to visit during the summertime and who had also seen the state's ""Come to Life"" ad campaign, practically half (49%) were specifically influenced by the fact that recreational marijuana was legal. Nevada is aiming to have a similar effect on tourism in the state. As you can probably surmise, though, not every lawmaker in Nevada is on board with the idea, including Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-Nev.) who noted, ""I did not support them [pot lounges] previously. I don't support them now."" Kevin Sabet, the head of anti-legalization movement group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, worries that pot lounges will lead to higher crime rates and not be a good thing for the state. Pardon the pun, but there's still a lot to be hashed out with pot-lounge discussions still in the early stages. Image source: Getty Images. Of course, Nevada may have a bit more to be concerned with than just whether it can regulate pot lounges. There's the possibility that the federal government could step up regulatory enforcement in the months to come. In February, now-former White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the Trump administration would take a tougher stance on federal regulatory enforcement of cannabis than the Obama administration. While he failed to outline the specifics of what that added enforcement might entail, it's had the industry on edge ever since. Making matters worse, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appears to be itching to wage war on medical marijuana businesses. The man in charge of the Justice Department sent a letter to congressional leaders in May requesting that they repeal the legislation protecting marijuana businesses operating in legal states from federal prosecution. Sessions has made it abundantly clear in previous speeches and Senate hearings that he doesn't care for marijuana one iota, and that he'll stop at nothing to halt or reverse its expansion. It's also worth noting that Republicans are just one of two groups remaining to still have a negative view of cannabis (senior citizens being the other). With Republicans in control of the legislative branches of government, it's certainly not out of the question that we see a crackdown of sorts on the industry. By the looks of things, the U.S. marijuana industry could have a very challenging year ahead, which serves as a warning to all weed-based companies and marijuana stock investors. ","
      
    Coming Soon to Nevada: Pot Lounges?  -- The Motley Fool

  ",-0.8302
174,Motley Fool Staff,9282017,Fool,9212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Lee Burbage: Oh, yes? Kara Chambers: I feel so honored. Thank you. Gardner: ... a third time. Burbage: My jacket fits perfectly. Thank you for that. Gardner: I think it's nice, Kara, that you said, ""honored."" I'm not sure it's even an honorable thing, but I appreciate that you would think that it is. I like to think in my better days that it is and thank you both for being with me this week. We're here to talk about culture and what it's like to work in the place that you work. And at The Motley Fool, when we started 24 years ago, what we had right, and the good news is, we were trying from the get-go to create a place that people would want to come to work each day. And why was that? Well, it's because there were two brothers and a friend of theirs. And they started the company. And when it came time to hire really their first non-founder employee, we didn't have a budget to go search. There was no LinkedIn. Actually, even the World Wide Web wasn't around quite yet. So who did we hire, right? We hired our fun friend from college. Or high school. We hired people we knew. And if you're going to hire people that you know at the start of your business, you're probably going to want to make it kind of a fun place to work. You're not probably going to count hours on them, or start counting vacation days. Some of the things that were very countercultural back then still are, as you both know, better than I do. Still countercultural today. It just came to us naturally because of the circumstance by which we started. So that's what we had right. What we didn't have right -- not that it was wrong -- but we didn't yet have the sense that culture was a thing. That that would be how these days people think about their workplace. There wouldn't be workshops, or keynote speeches about culture. There wouldn't be culture Fools. There weren't back then, but there are now, and I'm joined by them today, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, respectively. Kara, how long have you been at the Fool? Chambers: Almost 12 years. Gardner: Awesome. Lee? Burbage: Almost 19 years. Gardner: So that's 31, which is more than I've been at the Fool, and both of you are leaders and have helped steer The Motley Fool's culture to become one of the more acclaimed workplaces in America. A little bit of bragging -- I'm not reading from any brag sheet here -- but a couple of times in the last five years Glassdoor.com, the site that has employees rate their workplaces, has had The Motley Fool as the No. 1 place to work for small to medium-size companies in America, so there's a lot of competition. I'm imagining there's at least 10,000 other players out there. Chambers: We're going to talk about well-being. Overall well-being. We have a very highly engaged wellness program at the Fool, but that's part of a larger team. We call ourselves ""the thriving Fools."" We focus on the overall well-being of the individual and just thinking about growth and happiness at work. It's just -- many facets to well-being at work, so we're going to talk a little bit today about the different things we do. Gardner: Awesome! I was trying to establish a little bit of that humbly, because I'm trying to strike the right balance here. We put these ideas forward with humility, but I also want to say that we do put it forward with some authority as well. The Motley Fool, in the Washington, D.C. area, recently got an acclaim, Lee. Gardner: Did we receive an accolade as No. 1 for a certain thing in the last six weeks? Burbage: Yes, we did, David. The healthiest place to work. The most fun. What were the exact words, Kara? Chambers: I think we're the ""most athletic."" Burbage: The most athletic place to work in the D.C. area. Gardner: And I think it was funny, Lee, that you didn't even exactly remember that. Burbage: We win a lot of awards. Gardner: There are those of us who aren't that athletic, like, for example, me. I take great pride. Like I put up the strong-arm emoji on Twitter and say, ""We are the most athletic place to work in Washington, D.C. In the nation's capital."" Burbage: That's correct. Gardner: So whether or not Lee actually knew that, Kara, I'm glad that you did, and you and I similarly, unathletically, take great pride in that. So that's one form of well-being, but I know we're going to talk about others. Without further ado, let's get started. You both have brought some points, as you have in previous appearances. I think you have eight today, so we're going to bounce it back and forth. Who's up first? Chambers: I am. We're going to start with what we call our Bookie Monster program. We went through a very rigorous naming process for that program and just named it Bookie Monster. It's any business book you can request. We have a huge library here at the Fool just sitting there. That just opens up people to explore different topics. We'll talk about this more, but she focuses a lot on when your mind is in ""discover mode,"" when you're feeling good and you're happy, you're going to outperform. And the opposite, when you're stressed, when you're tired, when you're physically or emotionally drained, that's called ""defensive mode,"" and you're less able to learn, less able to solve complex problems. That book really helped to focus, at least me and my team, on this type of work. Gardner: So, Kara, the theme again is overall well-being. So while we did lead with the strong-arm emoji and the word ""athletic,"" you went right to books and reading and the life of the mind. The overall well-being of the Fool. How does the program work? Do people get books for free here? Chambers: They do. They just send an email to Bookie Monster and Bookie Monster will reply back and say, ""I have your book at the front desk."" It's magic. Gardner: Does that mean if I'm kind of a country wit -- I don't work at the Fool but I'm listening to this podcast -- I can just drop an email to bookiemonster@fool.com? Chambers: Oh, no, no! I'm going to check with our CFO first. Gardner: Ah! I thought I found a loophole. Chambers: You could try! Gardner: So is this a program that is well used? Chambers: It's very popular. And it's fun to walk past the front desk. You see the books waiting to be picked up by somebody. You can chat with them in the hallway and say, ""Hey, I just saw you pick that up. How is that one?"" It brings a culture of reading and learning to this office. Gardner: Out of curiosity, because I'm going to be playing the role of, occasionally this week, the small-business entrepreneur. Maybe I have five to 10 employees. Maybe I'm a Realtor and I have my team. We're not The Motley Fool with 300 employees and the kinds of resources that you might be talking about. What is the rough expense I should expect if I were to open up my own Bookie Monster? Per employee, let's say. Chambers: That's a good question. I want to say an Amazon book is maybe $15 and maybe the average person can read a book a month ... Gardner: That's way beyond the average American. Did you know that the average American has not read a book this year? Chambers: Oh, no! Gardner: And I'm not here to dump on my fellow Americans, because there are a lot of great ones, but studies that I've seen suggest that adults, most, don't actually read a full book in a year. Chambers: That's possible. Gardner: So it's possible that I, with my small business, might have a less active Bookie Monster, so it's even cheaper than what you're suggesting. But if I'm doing the math right, 12 times 15-ish is $180 a year ... Chambers: Yeah. Gardner: ... per employee. Burbage: Before I order a book, I go to our internal library and look on the shelf first, to see if it's there. And I'm going to say that fairly frequently I can find a book already. So we encourage people, when you order a book, after you read it, to put it in the library, and then others can use it, and that helps defer costs. Gardner: Awesome. And the last question before we move to Point No. 2. Kara, it's for business books, right? Chambers: Correct. It is broadly. Gardner: What is not a business book? How about that? Gardner: George R.R. Martin has not yet written, although he probably should, maybe has, a business book. Chambers: Business lessons in there that are terrifying. Gardner: OK, good. Lee? Point No. 2. Burbage: So another, it's along the lines of reading in terms of sort of opening up your mind. I think it's easy to get trapped in your day-to-day work and inside the walls of your company, and so we're encouraging people to sort of think outside. And so one way to do that is to bring outside speakers in. And so we encourage Fools at any level -- let's say you've read a book and you're interested in the author. We will reach out to that author and say, ""Hey, would you stop by and visit us?"" What we find is that people will often say yes. They're happy to come in and share their ideas and thoughts, and proud to talk. We had a recent example. I was out in our local community, and I heard a woman from a local school speaking about raising culturally conscious kids. I actually hadn't thought about that concept before. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing her speak and afterward said, ""Hey, would you mind stopping by my office and speaking to anyone in the office who has kids that I think would also enjoy your talk?"" And she said, ""Absolutely."" So we had Kiki come in. She spoke to our Fool parents. It was a chance to take a break from your normal day, think about something that normally you don't have mind space for, and just open up and learn. So we have a number of different speakers in. I'm going to say we have a speaker in at least every couple or few weeks. Again, it could be an author. It could be a business leader. It could be someone that you see in the community. Burbage: LeeB@fool.com. Gardner: LeeB@fool.com. We want to hear from you, and when you're coming through the Washington, D.C., area, if you'd like to come by and speak to our employees, we would treasure that. However, back to my small business. My team of 10 people. Maybe I can't get Elon Musk to come this fall, but it turns out I can get somebody that I met through school as a parent. Or somebody through a professional association that you can come in and have your people learn from. And if you do have a larger company, it doesn't have to be everybody. Maybe somebody like Elon Musk can fill the house. But I like the recent evolution, Lee, which is it feels like we have more speakers with smaller groups, with more diverse possibilities as a consequence. Burbage: Yes, and I think that actually feeds the program. You're going from someone like Elon Musk, who's incredible, but then also someone from your local community talking about a completely different topic. Just allowing your mind to stretch in those different ways is fun and exciting, and to your point exactly, Kiki just lives up the street, right, so it was great to have her in. I know I appreciated it, and so did other Fool parents. I think also what you're identifying is there are different groups and types of people in any company, and so the idea that you're going to bring in one speaker every time that's going to appeal to every person at your company is probably unrealistic. So I think what we find is anybody that you can bring in that 10 or more people are interested in, hey, you've hit a pocket of people -- in my case, Fool parents, people with small children -- who are thinking about ""Hey, how do I get out to these?"" Kara probably didn't come to that talk and was like, ""Hey, I'm not that interested."" But she probably came to the talk on keepers. We had a speaker come in about -- was it a Netflix series? Chambers: A documentary ... Burbage: ... that was super popular. Gardner: Ah, yes. Burbage: I didn't go to that one because that's not particularly interesting to me. I don't consider either one of those a failure. Gardner: And before we move to Point No. 3, have other businesses, maybe local, started to play the same game with us? Inviting either of you to come speak? Do you go out and speak, sometimes, to others? Burbage: Yes, I've been asked several times to come in and talk either to associations, groups, that sort of thing, or to local companies. I was speaking to MITRE, a consulting company here in D.C., on a panel that they had. It's a funny thing. When they asked me, I was like, ""Absolutely,"" because it makes you feel good. You're proud to go out and talk about yourself and the cool things we're doing. So people say yes. Gardner: Kara, I know that Lee really likes to speak. I don't know if either one of us likes to speak as much as Lee does. Do you like to speak? Chambers: It's not my favorite, but I keep trying. Burbage: She's super good at it. Chambers: No. I would say also just paying visits. A couple of years ago, one of my colleagues and I went to San Francisco to a conference, and then we had a day free, so we asked our colleagues for some networking. Zooming around. Visited a couple of companies and met with our counterparts there. Gardner: Great idea. Chambers: So it doesn't have to be a presentation. It can just be, ""Hey, can I talk to you about what you do here, and meet your counterpart?"" It's just, again, broadening the network. It doesn't necessarily have to be a talk. That's one way we connect as well. Gardner: Connecting. So Point No. 1 is reading. Point No. 2 is connecting. Kara, what's Point No. 3? Chambers: I have this as ""listening."" This is a project Lee and I work a lot on. We love our peer-coaching program. I put this in as listening because I read somewhere that one of the best gifts you can give somebody that's free is to just give them your undivided attention. What we do is have a peer-coaching program. You can pick and choose. There are different levels of leadership. Different departments. It's not as heavy-handed as a mentorship. It's kind of lightweight. It's maybe one or two meetings a year. They're the person who's delivering your 360 feedback. They're checking with you at least twice a year to talk about just how you are doing. Are you happy? Are you feeling good? What can we do to support you better? It just gives you another outlet with a slightly different agenda than your manager might have, or HR might have. I like doing a lot of coaching. I actually enjoy it. So I think for us, one aspect of well-being is just having someone to listen to you, and that's free. We've worked on it just to build out the logistics, but we find that valuable source internally. Gardner: Kara, you led with the phrase ""peer coach,"" and then you mentioned ""feedback."" Is that the way feedback happens at this company? Chambers: Yes. In a typical company when you would get your 360 feedback, it would get emailed to your manager, and they would have to deliver it to you. Gardner: So that's not The Motley Fool. This is Acme, Inc. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Acme, Inc. has your manager giving you the feedback. Chambers: Yes. That's typical, and as a manager, you want to know what's going on with your employee. But we turned it around, and it took away the pressure. There's zero consequences to someone giving you constructive feedback, because no one else is going to see it but you and your coach, and you just talk about it. And it's mine, so if it comes to me as feedback, I figure out what to do with it with the help of my coach. It doesn't get passed along. It's not part of my record. It doesn't affect my compensation. That frees up my colleagues, who are my friends, who don't want to negatively impact my career, to give constructive feedback with zero consequence. What we found is that creates a much more open environment for that conversation. Gardner: I hope this is fair. I'm going to eavesdrop, briefly, with your help, on The Motley Fool's feedback system. We're conducting that this month at the Fool. I'm going to ask you a couple of things about it really quickly. First of all, does everybody get feedback? Chambers: You can opt in. Everything we do here is optional, so you can choose. Gardner: So you decide if you want feedback. And I have to admit. I'm a little bit of a slacker, because it's August and I'm doing enough, so I didn't request it this time. Chambers: That's OK. Gardner: And that's OK, too. So feedback is not compulsory. It is earned by being asked for. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: That's odd. I think that's cool, though. Chambers: Again, if you are driving your own career, and you want to develop, you're the best person to know where you want to develop and how to figure that out. We also leave it open all year, so you can choose any time. It's kind of confusing, but there's a deadline because one of my colleagues calls it ""social permission"" to ask everybody at the company, or ask a bunch of people to fill something out about you, because it's work. It's still work. But we try to make it easy. We keep the questions really simple. Gardner: And that's where I want to keep eavesdropping, because when I used the form and typed in some feedback for one of my peers, there were just three questions. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Do you remember what they are right off the top? Because again, I'm listening to this podcast this week maybe because I am in business or an organization. I'm curious what you ask. Burbage: We do keep it simple, and we also keep it positive. So what we found is we want a situation that you're going to look forward to. Related to the manager, people don't normally look forward to a meeting with their boss where they're going to hear a bunch of negative things. Gardner: ""It's time for your annual review, Lee! Have a seat, please!"" Burbage: That sounds horrible, and there's been plenty of study in this area. So instead, you're having this meeting with this third-party sounding-board coach. Our questions change a little bit over time, but they tend to be around where are you awesome, and where can you be even more awesome. We're looking for places to double down, or where you're doing a really good job. And then we've added in a feature where you can ask for feedback in a specific area, so maybe you just completed a project, or there's a particular zone, listening or something that you think you're bad at. Gardner: Lee wants to know what you thought of his lemon meringue pie this month. And his new Lemon Meringue Pie Club. Burbage: Yes. So you may want something specific, and, again, we try to keep it positive. We're building systems here, I think, for all of these that we want people to want to use. Like the worst part of an HR job is running around trying to make people do things. We want to build programs that people are like, ""Oh, I can't wait for feedback to start. I'm looking forward to that, and I'm choosing to opt in."" As opposed to Kara and I having to run around telling you you have to do this thing that you don't want to. Gardner: So it sounds to me as if part of the culture is you've subverted yourself to the employee who is your customer, and you're trying to engage and please that person. Without compelling them or forcing them, you're working extra hard to figure out what they're going to like and want to use. But let me flip this back at you before we move to Point No. 4, because I can imagine some people are listening right now saying, ""You know what? There's a person on my team or at our company. They are not doing a good job, and it's very hard for me to be positive about them."" How do you be effective and negative or, I would say, corrective within such a -- to be unfair to you both -- happy-go-lucky, free love, lemon meringue pie environment? Burbage: I think it's actually a fairly straightforward answer, which is I think if you're waiting for some program to start, or a system to be kicked in for you to be able to give that person that negative feedback, you've probably waited too long, and it's probably not appropriate. I think, David, if you're having some problems with my performance ... Gardner: I'm a little uncomfortable with my performance, Lee. That's about me. Burbage: I'm uncomfortable here on the podcast. Gardner: I've picked some bad stocks in the last year. Burbage: Those are the situations where you shouldn't be relying on a program or system like this. You should be pulling that person aside and talk to them, giving them that kind of feedback. A system like this, or any feedback system, isn't designed to handle that super-heavy load. Chambers: It's about development. And we have one other thing we liked. It's another learning we've had, and that's in terms of language. We offer the option to say, ""I would like your advice on this."" We've heard this. Someone else had this concept. But instead of saying, ""I would like your feedback,"" saying, ""I would like your advice."" That's your takeaway tip. It's just easier. People will always want to give you advice. They don't want to give you feedback. They don't give you a grade. But they're like, ""Oh, you want my advice? OK."" And people will open right up. Gardner: Wow! Chambers: That's a thing that we learned recently this year. So we've added that in this round to see how that goes. Gardner: That's a great point. So that was No. 3, listening. Lee, No. 4. For instance, over the last few weeks Kara and I have been super-involved with a volunteer team of Fools that are investigating a potential new business line for our company, and we just need to do a little research work, so the call was put out. ""Hey, anybody interested in helping out?"" Maybe six Fools raised their hand and said they'd love to help out. So they're dedicating a few hours a week that they have free toward this new venture. And what happens over time is we're actually learning as a business if they're good in that area. And they're learning, as an individual, if that might be an area that they'd like to do even more. Sometimes people walk away and they'll be like, ""Ooh, boy. That was awful. I don't want to do that again."" Or we, as a business, might say, ""Ooh, you're actually not very good at that."" Or even better, we're like, ""Hey, you're great! You should do more of that,"" and it builds into more career development. So just getting people to use their extra bandwidth to get out and about the business and reach beyond what their normal day-to-day work may be. Gardner: I'm curious, Lee. You started that by saying we're a project culture. What does that mean, exactly? Burbage: I don't believe that we have a traditional hierarchy here. A traditional career ladder. People work here for many years and do lots of different things. Our favorite people are ones that are working on maybe six or seven different projects at one time. They may be diverse projects. Some may be leading. Some might be followers. Some might be just playing all kinds of different roles on a team. So you're getting your enjoyment here by working with people that you love on really challenging things that are driving toward our purpose, and that's how you're managing your career. It's moving from project to project, trying new things, getting involved in things that you're passionate about. Gardner: So it really is pretty subversive if you're thinking about a traditional org chart, and a title on your business card, and once I'm junior this, my next goal would be senior this, and I'll get that in three years. And there is a downside to not being that way, because sometimes we'll lose people here at the Fool who want that career path or a clearer sense of what's next, and sometimes they leave the Fool after a few years to go back to maybe a more traditional workplace where they can find that. So what we're describing here -- I don't know how idiosyncratic or not it is -- it's definitely how we roll, and we bet we're probably not the only organization that rolls that way. Burbage: Yes. I mean, I was not the first to say this. Gardner: The Greeks were. I don't even know what you're about to say, but it's very obvious, I think, that Socrates said this. Go ahead! Burbage: Socrates once said every company has a culture, but not every culture is right for everyone. So we have a pretty defined and unique culture that fits and is cool for a lot of people, but not for everybody. We're not a great resume builder or LinkedIn profile-builder company, although when people leave here, they do find some pretty great jobs, but it's nontraditional, sure. Gardner: OK, we're at halftime. Thank you for those first four points. You have four glowing points to come. And right after this brief ad break, I'm going to ask you to think about something in the last 12 months, since you last came on this podcast, that hasn't worked so well. It's natural for us to want to share out the things that have worked well, and I think best-practice sharing is much more valuable, but I know, I'm sure some of our listeners are curious about something that, you know, we're trying stuff all the time. What have we learned that we needed to tweak, or hasn't worked so well? So think about that. All right, Lee and Kara. I asked, before we go on to point No. 5, what's something that hasn't worked? Burbage: So one thing that's pretty easy to do is look at your budget and sort of circle those big items. It's probably healthy, right, to circle those in question, and one thing we did last year was to circle our holiday party and say, ""Wow, that's sort of an expensive event to take everyone and a guest."" And it's hard to get a venue during the holidays. Gardner: That's part of what makes it expensive, right, Lee? Because everybody else is trying to rent the same venues for the holidays, and so the rents go up. Burbage: Absolutely. And you know us. We like to do things different, better, special. And so we're like, ""Ha, ha, ha, we'll get them. We're going to do ours in April. We'll just combine it with some other events. And we won't do the plus one."" And so, essentially, we canceled our holiday party. And as it turns out people missed it. That wasn't such a great decision. And when we announced this year that we were bringing it back, we got a lot of notes and a lot of people that were super-excited. So it turns out I think the money is worth it. To bring people together. To bring their spouse. We sometimes only see that person once a year. To break a little bread and celebrate the year, the timing, the spirit. It works, and I think we made a mistake by canceling our holiday party, and I'm pretty stoked out about it. Gardner: And I was one of those people who wrote a note to you both thanking you. I thought I might be the only one who had written that note. Well, that's a good learning. Kara? Chambers: As we just talked about learning, one thing we're working on is we realized over the years that learning and development in an office has a temptation to bring everyone in and teach a class in a classroom. What you find is sometimes you have to bribe them with sandwiches, and maybe that's not in your budget, either, so you bring them in and you find your attendance starts dropping. So we said nothing is mandatory here. And we're noticing this kind of drop-off, and this is over years. Gardner: Because we have internal classes here at The Motley Fool. Now this is maybe not a normal thing for a lot of people. Kara, what would be a typical class that we might have taught over the years here at the Fool? Chambers: It could be an introduction to how a different department does their work. It could be leadership development for team leaders. The how-to. Gardner: How to fill out your 401(k), I can imagine. These kinds of things. Chambers: Yes, and again, those individually went well, and I'm only thinking of the good ones now. The memorable ones. I'm sure there were ones that were not memorable. But we found that their attendance was dwindling, and so we are spending our time thinking about how to create experiential learning. And you have to walk a line, because if you've got your best people working on your most valuable things, you have a hesitancy to take them off those valuable things to learn. So that constant push-pull is getting your best people and developing them even further, but it's a challenge. If you want something done, ask busy people. So just thinking about your really busy people and then you're like, ""Hey, can you teach this class? Can you do it?"" And what you find is it's hard to get that group. So we're trying to find ways. Maybe it's job swapping. We did a workshop with you not long ago on a project that was kind of fun. We're trying to think of other ways to bring people together to learn things without it being classroom-focused. Because, as we saw, the attendance was dropping, until at one point I remember seeing, ""This meeting is at noon and we don't get any food?"" OK, that's not why we're here. Gardner: Something can be fixed here. Chambers: That's not why we're here. That's something I learned. Gardner: Thank you both. Let's get back on our program, Point Nos. 5 to 8. Let's speed it up a little bit. I think my tendency to just enjoy this conversation too much has me asking too many questions. For our last four we're going to focus it a little bit more, and No. 5, Kara, I think I'm back to you. Chambers: I wouldn't be anywhere if I wasn't talking about an app you need to use. For those of you who are Slack users -- Slack is our internal instant-messaging program -- we use an app in there called Donut, and what that does is, it's an algorithm that pairs you with a random Fool for coffee every other Monday. It's optional. You can opt in. And you can drop out of the Slack channel if you don't want to have coffee the next Monday. They're using some kind of magic algorithm with people outside of your group. What I like about it is -- I'm an introvert. Parties or big happy hours I'll be shy at, but one on one I like talking to people. So once we installed it, I went around and I recruited all of my introverts, one by one, and said, ""Come on. It's so much easier to get to know people one on one with this."" Gardner: It's Donut! Donut! Chambers: Come on! Come on! So we have fun. It's really a nice, low-pressure way to build connections at the Fool. I've been in the position of giving and getting feedback of building your network, and for your more introverted people that can be difficult. So one at a time. At random. Chambers: Donut.ar. Gardner: And if you're not a Slack user, darn it, you probably can use pencil and paper and make a program like this, and pair random people who want to talk some. Burbage: Maybe dice. Chambers: Roll dice. Gardner: No, don't get me started. The gamer in me wants to talk about games. We're going to go back to Point No 6. Lee. So David, if you wanted to move your desk, which is just a table on wheels with two cords, you unplug your cords and you roll your desk over to wherever you want to go. You don't need to ask permission. You don't need to trade desks with somebody. There's no packing, or boxes, or anything. Literally just roll around. Our office is literally different every day, and it's because people are moving around and maybe like Kara, they need a few minutes to work by themselves, because they're more introverted, and they roll their desk over. Like, ""Hey, I'm on a team now. Let me roll that over to my team."" So just providing people that mobility and the autonomy to make their own decision about where and how they want to work has been a big thing for us, and I think people are happier and more productive. Gardner: We didn't force-rank these points, so we're not saying that Point No. 6 is the sixth most important thing. But for a lot of offices -- whether you are in a small or a large office -- that's very doable. Now, for some offices, maybe you have mahogany furniture or you have stuff built in. You have cubicles that are basically anchored to the wall. Maybe you can't do that. But at least your chair on wheels, at least being able to slide around and meet with people or hang out for four days in a workpod to get stuff done seems doable. It wasn't until year what of our company, Lee, that we finally figured out we could put stuff on wheels? Burbage: I think it was about eight years ago. Gardner: So year 16. It took us 16 years to figure that out. Burbage: When you were asking before about major mistakes that we made. I will say that when Bryan Tighe and Chad Wolfsheimer, two Fools that work here, came to me and talked to me about this, my first reaction was, ""That sounds crazy! No, no, no!"" And so it took them a little convincing of me. It's really part of the Scrum and Agile push. In your mahogany desk scenario, I would say we've also found a lot of success finding little spaces in hallways. Any little gap in the office where you can shove a couch or roll a few chairs into to just give people options of other places to sit and interact has been pretty powerful, too. So not being tethered to a mahogany desk in the corner, and instead being able to get out and move around and move about the cabin, we think, is a pretty big deal. Again, my idea from the beginning. Gardner: Kara, Point No. 7. Chambers: Caring. I do our engagement surveys, and for at least nine years a very popular engagement survey question is, ""My team leader, or someone at work, cares about me as a person."" And I enjoy, every time I open up the survey, and it goes up one more point. We're at 95%. That's a humble brag there, but I think it's important. It's part of our culture. A very family-oriented culture. And all the things we do, we want to help you feel like this is part of your family. People you see every day you spend a lot of time with, and so caring about each other is a part of your well-being, just knowing that people do. It's a high driver. It's something that we take pride in that's always been part of our culture. Even when other engagement scores go up and down, I see this go up and I say that makes a resilient culture. That tells me that we are all in it because we care about each other, and I would be a sad person if I had to get up in front of a company and present a score like 50. Gardner: And actually implicit in Point No. 7 -- caring, Kara -- is that we're measuring. And we're not really talking about that this time. I think we've talked about that in a prior podcast. By the way, I'm going to plug your two previous appearances at the end, shortly, so people can find more of such ideas. Chambers: Yeah, and what we say is every company is a great place to work in its own way, and for us that's a big one, and if you have that at your company, just building on it, right? It comes from starting with your founders and hiring your friends, but building from there. Starting with people who care about each other. Gardner: And to be maybe just a little bit soupy and sentimental, Kara and Lee, you're some of my good friends here at the Fool, and I didn't know you when we started The Motley Fool. So one of the things that happens, if you're in a good office, and you stay around for a while, and you've got a positive culture, regardless of what business you're in, is that some of your best friends end up being the people that you're working with every day and you didn't even know them when you graduated high school or college. Point No. 8, Lee. Burbage: So No. 8 builds a little bit on my holiday-party point. Just not forgetting the fun and building into the fun. It can be so easy and, again, to use your word, sappy. We're like, ""Hey, we should have another activity, or another fun event!"" So we do still try to have at least some sort of fun company event that's organized once a month. And the one I wanted to highlight was one that we had from last month, because I'm particularly excited. We tried to think about how could we do something fun that also draws in our remote workforce. So we have a decent number of Fools that are working from around the United States and around the world. All different sorts of time zones. And that can make having a fun event difficult to pull off and maybe even makes them sad. So here we're doing something fun at the headquarters, and we've got someone in Singapore who's saddened because they can't participate. So here's what we did -- a push-up challenge. We've come full circle to being the most athletic company here ... Gardner: Yeah. How could we not mention that in Washington, D.C., we are the reigning, most athletic company in the capital of maybe arguably the most powerful nation the world has ever known? Burbage: I think our hope is they never give that award again, and then we're only the only one ever. But we did a push-up challenge, and it was very simple. You can do this in your company. We had a Google doc where you go and put your name in. I know that you both participated. And just on a daily basis you marked down how many push-ups you're doing and you have a goal. And there's actually some banter talking inside the Google doc, and we had some prizes. Gardner: And some teams challenged some other teams with that. Burbage: Absolutely. So if you're in Singapore, you're in Australia, or you're here in Washington, D.C., you can get in that Google doc. You can participate. It happened all month long. We had a super-fun time. We did, I think, 150,000 push-ups as a company. So we found a way for us to have fun as a company, which I think is easy to forget, especially in the busy world that we live in today. So adding some fun into your company and finding ways for everybody to participate is something I'm particularly excited about. Gardner: OK, we're going to close this one up. I want to give a little bit of a plug to one or two resources that people who have enjoyed this podcast can access, but before I do that I want to ask you each one final question, and Kara, randomly I'll pick you for the first one and Lee, you for the second. Each of these comes from a different type of a listener. We're going to call them ""opposite listeners."" Kara, you're going to speak briefly to the person who has no budget. They're either at a smaller company than The Motley Fool -- and there are many smaller companies than The Motley Fool -- or they're a larger company but there's just no budget for things like wellness or fun. So I'm listening to you guys. You're talking about something that sounds great. I mean, I wish I had that kind of pie in the sky, but I don't. What can I learn from this podcast? What can I do? Chambers: Push-ups and Google docs. They're free, so I'll start with that. Talking about mistakes. Before we had a wellness person, we designed our own wellness challenge, and it was really ridiculously complicated, but we did it. Gardner: It's helpful to have senior people who understand what they're doing. Chambers: It's better in the hands of a professional. That's all I'll say. But nobody got hurt. So try. Loaning books among each other is free. Sitting down and listening to your colleagues -- I'd say the No. 1 takeaway, too, is if you're just starting out in a business, it's really easy to think of now I'm in management and I have to be the police for my employees. And for us it's always, come from a place of trust -- a place of positivity -- and it works. That's why I like to go out into the world and say you can have that with three people, and ideally I hope you do. Gardner: So, so much of what we just covered in these 45 minutes or so is free. It's just about making decisions, having frameworks, and having some internal commitment, or willingness to get there. Willingness to experiment. All right, Lee, you're going to come at this from the other angle. ""Hey, The Motley Fool is a cute company. I appreciate the podcast. I've followed some of your stock picks. You guys are just 300 employees. I work at a division that itself is 3,000 employees. We have tons of resources."" So, Fools listening to this hour, I'm wondering if you had twice the budget that you have, because this hypothetical person that you're going to be, for a sec, Lee, does. This person has twice the budget that we have for employees to focus on wholeness and well-being. If you had more, how would you be spending it? Burbage: I reject the question. The reason I say that is I don't think it's about money. I think what I would love in that scenario, if it were me, is I would have scale to do things that Kara and I can't do because we just don't have enough people. For instance, our coaching program, I think, would be even richer, because I would be leveraging all those people that exist at that company. So whether it's the coaching program or speakers, I don't necessarily need to go external to find speakers. I bet you with a large population inside my company, there are some pretty interesting people that could teach a class. Speak about something that they're doing. So just being able to leverage the human power of all the interesting folks in that scenario would be cool. The second thing I would say is killing systems or processes that are unpopular and not very powerful at scale is a big deal. Gardner: Very powerful. Burbage: Yes. To kill the performance appraisal at 300 was a big deal. To kill the performance appraisal at 3,000 or 6,000 -- they'll write a book about you. Gardner: Well, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, two world-class thinkers, and I'm going to say that again with my entrepreneurial pride on my sleeve because of The Motley Fool's renown as a place to work and a place that's constantly experimenting, sometimes with small budgets. I love Lee's point that it's not about money. That's what Kara said as well. So much of this is free. But willing to experiment and try and see what works, and try to make the workplace better for one of our key stakeholders that every organization -- for-profit and not-for-profit -- has, and that's your employees or, if you will, your human capital. I mentioned earlier that I've done two previous podcasts with Kara and Lee, and if you'd like to hear either one of them, I'm going to call them out right now. The very first one was their appearance on Dec. 2, 2015: ""10 Traits of a Great Company Culture."" So if you're on iTunes, you can just scroll down to 12/02/15. Listen to it yourself. Share it with your manager or the big boss at your organization -- whoever it is -- share it out! And then they came back in 2016. The day was May 11. And we imaginatively named that one ""10 More Traits of a Great Company Culture."" Not quite sure what we're going to call this one, because I don't make that call each week. More talented people here at the Fool name these, but maybe we'll have ""10 Even More Great Traits,"" or maybe we'll be more focused on wellness, which was the purpose of this podcast. Kara and Lee, sharing with you what they've learned about the overall well-being of your employees. Now Lee, if you're comfortable, let's say I've really enjoyed this podcast, or one of these, and I want to get in touch with this team at the Fool. How do I reach you? Burbage: I'm happy for people to email me. LeeB@fool.com. It's pretty fun, because it's ""Lee B A Fool."" Gardner: LeeB -- letter B ... Burbage: @fool.com. Gardner: Lee B A Fool. I get it. OK. LeeB@fool.com. And Kara, The Motley Fool has a culture blog. Chambers: Yes. It's culture.fool.com, and all of our content, our job postings, anything we do here. How to get in touch with us. Gardner: We take pictures of ourselves on Halloween or silly, ridiculous stuff. Chambers: You would think all we did was dress up in costumes. Gardner: One would sometimes think. I do follow and I can follow it, by the way, on Twitter at Motley Fool Culture. Burbage: Instagram. Gardner: OK, good. So I do see some of those pictures. Chambers: Yes. Instagram. Motley Fool Culture. I'm TMFKara on Twitter, so I post a lot of stuff I read on there. Gardner: Awesome! Thank you both so much for your time! Thank you, Rule Breaker, whoever and wherever you are. And it's our hope, on behalf of Kara, Lee, and myself, that you find ways to make the place around you, where you go to work every day, better for you and those around you in the year ahead. Fool on!

    8 Ways The Motley Fool Does Workplace Well-Being Right -- The Motley Fool

175,Stratfor analysts,9282017,MarketWatch,9212017,"Published: Sept 27, 2017 12:14 p.m. ET A war of words could escalate to a real war By The United States has declared war on North Korea, according to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong. In a brief news conference in New York on Sept. 25, Ri said U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent statements to the U.N. General Assembly were tantamount to a declaration of war and that all of the members of the United Nations clearly heard that it was the United States that first declared war on North Korea. Therefore, Ri argued, Pyongyang has a right to self-defense under the U.N. charter and would be justified if it were to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers, even outside North Korean territory. Over the past week, the rhetoric between the United States and North Korea has rapidly escalated. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un responded to Trump’s Sept. 19 U.N. speech by saying that Pyongyang was seriously considering the “highest level of hard-line countermeasures in history.” The statement, accompanied by a picture of Kim sitting at a desk and looking intently into the camera — reminiscent of U.S. presidential addresses to the nation during times of crisis — was clarified later to suggest Pyongyang could carry out an atmospheric nuclear test in the Pacific Ocean. Though much of the escalation has been rhetorical rather than concrete, both North Korea and the United States are inching closer to backing up their words with action to demonstrate their positions. The United States is openly discussing shooting down North Korea’s next missile test, and North Korea has responded with what it considers to be an equivalent threat: the possibility of shooting down U.S. strategic bombers near the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has long equated the U.S. strategic bombers patrolling the peninsula to its own missile program and has warned that it could launch missiles to the U.S. coastline in a parallel show of range and force. Trump’s comments to the United Nations and the additional sanctions his administration recently imposed against North Korea could be seen as one step along the traditional path to U.S. military action. This path involves the U.S. making a strong case to the international community before resorting to unilateral action justified by the inability or unwillingness of the world to act. Washington has yet to take concrete action to suggest that it is preparing to strike. It has not changed its force posture or made moves to evacuate the 125,000-140,000 American civilians living in South Korea. Neither does North Korea appear to be significantly altering the positions of its forces, though it is exploiting increased U.S. threats to rally the North Korean population around the embattled government in Pyongyang. Though neither the United States nor North Korea is making the formal movements that would suggest an imminent, purposeful military conflict, the fever pitch between the two and the increased shows of force do raise the likelihood that an accident or miscalculation could lead to conflict. North Korea and the United States have not agreed on basic rules of engagement for air encounters. So, should North Korea decide to scramble aircraft to intercept U.S. flights, even if it has no intent to engage, the potential for an accidental collision is high. In the region, aircraft have collided with U.S. aircraft in the past, last in 2001 off the Chinese coast, but military tension wasn’t nearly as high then. U.S actions could be just as risky: If Pyongyang follows through on its threat to test a nuclear device in the Pacific, Washington could try to shoot down the launch, particularly if the weapon is on a trajectory that could bring it near the U.S. coast. In each scenario, tit-for-tat responses could lead to a rapid escalation unintended by either side. Amid the intensifying standoff, signs of back-channel diplomatic efforts should be watched for, even if it appears that there is little space for a compromise that would satisfy both sides. Russia is working with North Korea diplomatically, and the North Korean Foreign Ministry official in charge of North America is in Russia this week, creating one such space for possible back-channel diplomacy. China’s actions should also be watched closely. China’s relationship with North Korea has been strained for the past several years, and many of the United States’ warnings of military action could be meant more to convince China to take a stronger stand rather than to directly convince North Korea to change its course of action. Any changes in military postures will, of course, also be significant. These include the possibility that the United States could change the way it conducts its strategic bomber missions, by switching to stealth aircraft or expanding fighter escorts, for example. The probability of intentional war is still relatively low without additional escalation, but the potential for accidental conflict is increasing. North Korea has threatened that in the near future it could test its missiles near the U.S. territory of Guam, test its missiles off the U.S mainland coast, intercept U.S. bombers near the Korean Peninsula and conduct an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean. The United States has been less specific in its threats, but it has increased its strategic bomber flights, has talked more openly about shooting down North Korean missiles and has discussed sending additional strategic assets to the region. And more physical action makes it more likely that accident and miscalculation could follow.

The fares Martin was seeing must have been outside that date range or not direct flights, a spokesman from American Airlines told MarketWatch. Martin did not respond to request for comment. George Hobica, founder of flight booking site Airfarewatchdog.com, previously told MarketWatch that price increases following Hurricane Irma were likely not intentional. “I don’t think airlines would be callous or stupid enough to be consciously jacking up fares,” he said. “If there’s any gouge, it’s just the last minute walk-up airfares that are designed for desperate business fliers.” American Airlines resumed its flights to Puerto Rico on Monday, which had been suspended since Hurricane Irma.

178,Tim Mullaney,9282017,MarketWatch,9212017,"Published: Sept 26, 2017 9:21 a.m. ET Trump’s real gripe with the NFL seems to be: Not enough brain damage By For a celebrity-obsessed president, Donald Trump sure had a bad week in the culture wars. First, he got schooled on health-care policy by Jimmy Kimmel — a more successful comedian than he is. Then he went to Alabama, where he ranted about, mostly, football. Short version: He liked it better in the old days. He dislikes uppity players kneeling for the national anthem to provoke conversation about race, and wants them fired. But his funniest, most revealing bit was about how new rules barring targeting of players’ heads — prompted by generations of players with life-shortening brain damage, and sadly highlighted by last week’s test results showing that murderous ex-New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez had late-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy when he committed suicide in prison — were unmanly and taking the fun out of the National Football League. Donald Trump, in other words, is foursquare for brain damage. Yay! But you kneeeewww thaaat. Back at the White House, he picked a fight with the NBA champion Golden State Warriors and erstwhile Most Valuable Player Steph Curry, pulling the traditional White House invitation for major-sports champions because Curry said he wasn’t sure he wanted to go and honor Trump. He tweeted more — and markets know how much a Trump tweet matters, or doesn’t — about the NFL and sports, and it got worse and worse. Trump backer and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady called his comments “divisive.” Patriots CEO Robert Kraft, a pal who gave Trump a Super Bowl ring and claims Vladimir Putin stole another one, said ”our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork” that NFL players teach. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan, a Pakistani immigrant whose $7 billion stack is way bigger than that of a president who measures himself by money, joined his players’ protest at a game in London. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called Trump divisive. When you’re being lectured by a guy who didn’t give Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice a long suspension for beating his then-fiancee until video surfaced, you’re having a really bad week. Oh, and basketball legend LeBron James called Trump a bum. On Twitter yet. Here’s a guide to what really dishonors our patriotic totems, far more than exercise of free speech by football players. The presidency is dishonored when leading newspapers verify that the president personally lied every one of his first 40 days in office, among hundreds of whoppers in the first 100 days and beyond. The American flag is dishonored when the president of the United States describes violent neo-Confederate protesters who fly the Stars and Bars as “very fine people.” The vow of “liberty and justice for all” in the Pledge of Allegiance is dishonored when that president appoints an attorney general just this side of being a neo-Confederate sympathizer, one who was rejected by a Republican Senate for a judgeship in 1986 over his racial attitudes. The Constitution is dishonored when a president’s entire team demands the firing of people who disagree with him, from ESPN host Jemele Hill to whatever Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was thinking about when he said NFL players should have “free speech on their own time.” The hard work of 153 million employed Americans is dishonored when Trump can’t work hard enough to learn the contents of his own health-care bill — the latest version of which is still rattling around Capitol Hill even after GOP Arizona Sen. John McCain’s announcement last week that he will vote against it pretty much put a fork in it. Jimmy Kimmel, former host of “The Man Show,” is a harder-working citizen than the president now. And yes, the service of people like McCain is dishonored when a military-school brat who accepted four student deferments from the Vietnam-era draft, followed by a finding of physical impairment that mysteriously doesn’t keep Trump from golfing, disrespects soldiers who were captured as losers. It’s probably not a coincidence that McCain followed up his knifing of Trump’s bill by telling “60 Minutes” that Trump never apologized for saying that about him in 2015. Neither is it accidental that McCain chalked up Trump’s reticence to his ‘different upbringing.’’ All of Trump’s self-created myths exploded in his weekend of fantasizing that football fans would come to his rescue. But the most serendipitous part was watching him get buried by his own people -- those just as rich and successful as Trump imagines himself to be.

Morgan Stanley estimated Curry’s worth to Under Armour at $14 billion last year. And as Trump was braying, Infiniti was rolling out an ad campaign featuring Curry and his 5-year old daughter. He also just signed a five-year, $201 million contract extension, about twice as much as Trump reportedly made per year hosting NBC’s “The Apprentice.” Khan, who made a fortune in auto parts before buying the team, is twice as rich as Trump and Pakistani to boot, one of 16 immigrants Forbes says are richer than Trump. James has a lifetime contract with Nike with an estimated $1 billion value, three championship rings to Curry’s two, and has earned $200 million and counting on the court. In a move that will resonate with Trump’s creditors, he also has taken less money to leave more to pay teammates. He’ll be a billionaire in a dozen years or less, most likely. Kraft is richer than Trump, too, at $4.2 billion, and has built a state-of-the-art organization that has won five Super Bowls, not least because it plucked Brady from the remainder bin with a sixth-round draft pick. Trump hired Steve Bannon and Mike Flynn.. All of these guys save Khan are also champions, the best at what they do. Trump is trying to cut rich guys’ taxes, seize poor folks’ health insurance, and get his approval rate over 40% without starting a nuclear war with North Korea. Trump’s headache must be the dull pain you get when someone dunks on your head. The buzz he hears is the sports world talkin’ ‘bout his Mama. Mr. President, if you’d worn a helmet you might have avoided some of this. ",Trump gets sacked in the culture wars - MarketWatch,0.9951
179,Alessandra Malito,9282017,MarketWatch,9212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 9:43 a.m. ET Paradise sounds nice, if you’re not in a storm’s path By When John King decided to retire abroad, he took two exploratory trips and spent 18 months researching online before choosing Lake Chapala, Mexico. He had a list of criteria: climate, cost of living and community. They also took into consideration any potential natural disasters. As the Caribbean and other retirement dream destinations outside of the United States get hit with storm after storm, near-retirees must surely wonder: Just how much do they want to risk for a piece of paradise? King isn’t risking much, considering he lives in the central highlands of Mexico at an elevation of 5,000 feet. Hurricane Maria is the latest storm to hit the Caribbean, which was also affected by Hurricane Irma earlier this month, killing at least 24 people. Maria strengthened to a “potentially catastrophic” Category 5 on Monday evening, and by Friday it had hit a large portion of the Caribbean and caused enough damage on Puerto Rico to knock out its electrical grid. Islands also suffered by Hurricane Jose — almost all of Barbuda and St. Martin sustained damage or were completely destroyed, according to the Washington Post. Yet despite weather risk and vulnerable infrastructure, overseas retirement is growing in popularity — about 400,000 American retirees live abroad, according to the Social Security Administration, and that number has climbed 17% between 2010 and 2015. Some choose islands and Mexico, while others go to Germany, Japan and Canada. More baby boomers are expected to leave the workplace, and then the country, in the next 10 years. See: 10 of the best places to retire abroad There are benefits to retiring abroad — for starters, it’s an entirely new life, and perhaps one that is a bit slower-paced and more relaxing. It can also be cheaper, especially in places where the U.S. dollar dominates local currency. Japan, for example, which has a large U.S. military presence (such as on the island of Okinawa), has about 42% of American retirees. One former serviceman who retired in Japan said he paid $350 for the country’s national health insurance policy, which covers 70% of his costs, according to Benefits Pro. King, who blogged about his retired life, says another advantage is simply enjoying living in a different culture and having a like-minded expat community. “I believe anyone contemplating becoming an expat to do their research and be open minded,” he said. “Living in a foreign country is not for everyone and if one is doing it because it is less expensive they will probably fail.” That’s the problem — the imbalance between expectation and reality — and it could get a retiree in deep trouble should they move somewhere without proper planning. “People have a romantic notion of what it’s going to be like to live somewhere,” said Ken Moraif, a financial adviser at Money Matters, a financial advice seminar and podcast in Plano, Texas. Moraif suggests people planning to move abroad for retirement test it out first. He had one couple as clients who wanted to sell their home and move to Belize, where they could relax and deep-sea fish, but Moraif suggested they rent a place for six months to try it out. After three months, the clients came back, saying it was a great vacation spot, but not a place they could live. Another client decided to buy a vacation home in Mexico, and had trouble selling the home years ago when the local economy was not doing well. Health care options, cost and availability vary, depending on the location, so retirees should also take into consideration how they will fund health care and what income will sustain them in this new living arrangement. See also: If I retire abroad, what happens to my Social Security and Medicare? Still, it’s important for retirees planning to move abroad — especially to any islands — to check weather patterns and make a list of what they need to know, such as local laws, costs of medical care, taxes, crime, and participating in local and U.S. politics, the U.S. State Department suggests. They should already have an emergency savings and cash on hand, not gold, Moraif said. Moving back is often an option, and expats consider it, according to a survey of almost 400 people who retired abroad: 42% of the expats never planned to come back to the U.S. and 37% weren’t sure, while 16% do plan to return when they’re old or sick. Another 4% said they intended to move back as soon as possible and 3% said they would move back within five years. They may also want to consider flood insurance if they’re in an area that could flood (almost 80% of the homeowners affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston did not have flood insurance). And retiring outside the U.S. to paradise isn’t for everyone — in the same survey of expats, about 71% said they were living a simpler, less stressful life, compared with the 82% who were hoping for it. Retirees should also visit their dream destinations during the low season. “All year round is completely different than taking a vacation there,” said Dan Prescher, senior editor of International Living, Internationalliving.com who lives in the south of Guadalajara in western Mexico, with his wife. During that time, go food shopping, see how the internet and phone connectivity is, and imagine actually living there every day, he said. Some people make the mistake of buying property in a place without really giving it a chance, and end up in a tough situation to sell and move again. “People in the states have been doing this for years,” Prescher said. “The only difference is you’re looking offshore, so you’re going a little farther and English may not be the language where you land.” ",After the hurricanes: What to know before retiring abroad - MarketWatch,0.9775

Finally, right Paul? Not once have I thought, ""You know, I wonder what Steven Seagal thinks about any single issue in the world today."" At any rate, Seagal conveyed his thoughts with the signature flair he brought to such cinematic masterpieces as “The Patriot” and “The Foreigner.” Oh, but he wasn’t done. Not by a long shot. It’s probably best we let him finish. “I believe in free speech, I believe everyone’s entitled to their own opinion,” Seagal continued in an interview on ITV Wednesday. “But I don’t agree that they should hold the United States of America or the world hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game and imposing their political views.” Seagal also took a flying side kick to face of the Deep State. “We have these Democrats that have this whole other agenda to kind of — when I say Democrats it’s not just the Democrats, but there are this whole group of left of Obama-ites and people that feel they should overthrow Trump,” he said. “And any decisions he makes, anything he tries to do, he gets blocked often from the enemies within, so it’s very difficult for him to do anything.” Watch the full clip here: It wasn’t so much the message, however, that made “Steven Seagal” one of the internet’s top trending topics on Wednesday morning.

181,Alessandra Malito,9282017,MarketWatch,9212017,"Published: Sept 28, 2017 9:42 a.m. ET This is the average new retiree age around the world By Americans may wonder if they’ll ever retire in their 60s, but for in most other parts of the world, retirement age is closer to early to late 50s. The full retirement age for Americans is 66 years old, according to the Social Security Administration. The oldest official age of retirement is in Norway, where it’s 67.75 years old, and on the other side of the spectrum, Yemen’s official age of retirement is 53, according to an analysis of retirement ages around the world conducted by caregiving firm Aperion Care. Countries in South America range between mid to late 50s — Venezuelans are officially retired at 57.5 years old and for Brazilians, it’s 60. The official retirement age of most European countries hovers in the mid-60s. See: 10 of the greatest places in the world to retire if you’re not rich The face of retirement has changed drastically for Americans. At one point, workers could rely on defined benefit plans, also known as pensions, where employers’ were responsible for funding most if not all of a retiree’s life. Most Americans now, however, are on the hook for their retirement savings, either funding defined contribution plans, or employer-sponsored plans, and individual retirement accounts or other vehicles. Almost all Americans in a Transamerica survey on retirement felt “very or somewhat” personally responsible for making sure they had enough to survive in retirement, compared with 73% of respondents around the world. Does this mean Americans are the most prepared for retirement? Hardly, in contrast, many have barely saved for it. India came out on top of financial services firm Aegon’s Retirement Readiness Index, scored on personal responsibility, awareness, financial understanding, planning and financial preparations and income replacement. Indian workers said almost half of their retirement income came from their own savings, and they were also the most likely to have a backup plan for their later years. But Americans also aren’t the only ones anxious about retirement. Pre-retirees in four countries (the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Australia) are nervous about whether or not they’ll be OK in retirement, which makes them less satisfied about their finances than retirees, who are currently experiencing retired life, according to a research report by investment management giant Vanguard. In the U.S. and Canda, 65% of recent retirees felt highly satisfied with their financial situations, compared with 53% of pre-retirees in the U.S. and 46% in Canada. In the U.K., 78% of recent retirees were highly satisfied compared with 52% of pre-retirees, and in Australia, those numbers were 59% and 41%, respectively. In essence, sometimes the anxiety of transitioning into retirement could be worse than the reality of it for some retirees. See also: How we retired to a beautiful, inexpensive town in Italy And just because some countries have younger retirement ages, or are on a list of top retirement hot spots, doesn’t mean Americans should go flocking there immediately for their golden years (even though about 400,000 Americans are currently retired abroad). Along with the idea of relaxing through retirement, Americans might want to consider family, taxes, crime and health care if they were to live abroad. What’s more, a country’s “official” retirement age doesn’t always reflect reality. Just like many Americans work well into their late 60s because they didn’t save enough or simply don’t want to give up their jobs, Aperion’s map shows some people stop working before and after that official age.

182,,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba’s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health “attacks,” spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba’s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure “equity” in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as “unjustified,” accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba’s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump’s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,” Tillerson said in a statement. “We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,” he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late. Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government’s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks. “I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,” Rubio, an influential voice on Trump’s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said: “This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.” “It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,” said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana. “This is madness by Trump. It’s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.” Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.” Rodriguez urged the United States “not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.” In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy’s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving. “I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” he wrote. “Hasta la proxima Cuba.” ","

183,,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Businesses catering to U.S. tourists visiting Cuba have had a rude awakening in the last few months after enjoying a 2-1/2-year boom. First, U.S. President Donald Trump in June ordered tighter restrictions on travel to the Caribbean island. Then the U.S. State Department warned on Friday against going there after a spate of alleged attacks on its diplomats in Havana, stating until the cause was determined, it could not guarantee Americans’ safety. The new regulations have not yet been published, and the warning does not mean Americans cannot travel to Cuba. Still, the moves relegate the island back to the realm of “forbidden fruit” to be enjoyed at one’s peril. “Just as the re-establishment of Cuba-U.S. relations was a positive influence, now this will be very negative,” said Jose Enrique Montoto, who rents an apartment, often to American guests, through the online marketplace Airbnb. “They are creating a mood of insecurity for those who want to travel to Cuba.” Montoto, 57, said three U.S. citizens who were set to arrive in Havana on Saturday had canceled their reservation with him at the last minute without an explanation. He worried that more would do the same. To be sure, less than 10 percent of foreign visitors to the island are Americans, even though the number of those travelers tripled to 285,000 last year due to new exemptions to the travel ban in the wake of the 2014 U.S.-Cuban historic detente under former U.S. President Barack Obama. According to Cuban government statistics, that would place local revenues from Americans’ sojourns at about $300 million. Cuba has long catered largely to Canadian and European tourists, and some local business owners said recent events under Trump were a harsh reminder not to rely too much on one market. Still, others said Americans were particularly good clients who paid well. They also feared the U.S. travel warning would further tarnish Cuba’s image as a safe and idyllic destination after Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc there last month. A dip in tourism this year would be a further blow to Cuba’s economy, which already is struggling with a drop in cheap oil shipments from key ally Venezuela, lower exports and a cash crunch. However, business could suffer if fewer Americans visit there. Trump has said he wants to eliminate one of the most popular exemptions to the U.S. travel ban on Cuba, the self-directed “people-to-people” category. Confusion remains about what will be allowed. “I’m concerned about the impact (the warning) will have on our 2018 and 2019 business,” said Andrea Holbrook, owner of Gainesville, Florida-based Holbrook Travel, which runs tours to more than 30 countries. “Cuba certainly has been an emerging destination,” she said on Saturday at a Havana conference organized by the Responsible and Ethical Cuba Travel association (RESPECT), a U.S. group of more than 150 businesses and non-profits bringing Americans to the island. U.S. tour operators said the alleged attacks had not affected any U.S. tourists and that Cuba remained one of the safest destinations possible. “Our conclusion was this seems to be a political statement, not a warning because they are worried about peoples’ health,” said RESPECT Co-Coordinator Bob Guild. Cubans in the hospitality sector said that rather than wait for relations to improve under Trump, they should instead look to new markets. “He is trying to close the door to us ever more,” said Aimee Santos, 53, who rents out her flat, “but whenever a door closes, others open.” ","

184,,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Refugees and migrants in Greece receive little or no medical care for most health problems they face and fewer than half of those pregnant had access to maternal care, aid group Doctors of the World said on Tuesday. About 60,000 migrants and refugees are stranded in Greece, most in overcrowded camps with unsanitary conditions. More than half of this year’s 20,000 arrivals were women and children, United Nations data shows. Doctors of the World interviewed over 14,000 women treated at its clinics in Greece over three years and found fewer than 47 percent had access to antenatal care before it intervened. It also found as many as 72 percent of the health problems refugees faced were treated “inadequately” or not at all. While most countries offer new arrivals some kind of medical screening, the quality was “questionable” and overlooked mental health problems, the charity said. Often, women did not seek medical care because they were unaware of their rights, they found the healthcare system too complex or they were afraid of being arrested or discriminated against. Limited resources and lack of access to services such as translators also posed practical obstacles. “Every mother deserves good care before, during and post pregnancy. Their residential status should not affect this basic right,” said Nikitas Kanakis, head of Doctors of the World Greece. The charity, together with healthcare company MSD, known in the United States as Merck, is implementing a two-year initiative aimed at providing maternal healthcare services to pregnant women and babies from vulnerable populations in Greece. Asylum seekers in Greece have free access to hospitals and medical care but the public health system, already battered by years of economic crisis, is struggling to cope with the numbers. Adult migrants without documents only have access to emergency care unless they are considered “vulnerable”. “Access to quality maternal healthcare can save lives, yet across Europe the most vulnerable pregnant women are still facing challenges in accessing this basic care,” said Mary-Ann Etiebet, director of MSD for Mothers. A lack of antenatal care to prevent and identify conditions that may harm the fetus or mother increases the risk of complications during childbirth or passing on diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis B, the World Health Organisation says. “We must work together this address this issue before it escalates further,” Etiebet said.

185,,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma lashed Orlando, Florida, last month, Amanda Leite needed a doctor for her 4-year-old daughter, who had a fever. Finding a pediatrician’s office with both electricity and a doctor on call was not an option. Neither was breaking curfew to get to an emergency room. Until then, Leite had never thought about telehealth, which is seeing a doctor via video chat. The service is now offered through most major health insurance systems with a copay equal to that of a traditional doctor’s office visit. It can also be obtained independently for per-use costs that vary by provider and locale. Teladoc Inc, the largest provider in the United States, says it sees about 5,000 patients a day, for an out-of-pocket fee of $45 or less. Leite then remembered a notice she had seen on Facebook from Nemours Children’s Hospital that its telehealth app, which is serviced through American Well, would be free for those affected by the storm. Within minutes, she had a doctor on her phone screen who had access to her daughter’s electronic health record. They did a basic exam, with Leite pressing on her daughter’s stomach, weighing her and holding her phone to the child’s mouth so the doctor could see her throat. The doctor determined that rushing to the hospital was not necessary, and that the girl could wait to see her regular doctor when the storm cleared. “It made me feel a lot better that I didn’t need to rush her to ER,” said Leite, 37. She is now sold on using a doctor online for future occasions when she is unable to travel or when the illness requires no immediate hands-on exam. OPEN-ENROLLMENT PUSH Employers hope this concept of gaining remote access to doctors catches on quickly, because it promises cost savings. As companies start the annual process of open enrollment for healthcare benefits for the coming year, expect a big push by Corporate America to promote the availability of telehealth. U.S. companies are facing a 4.3 percent increase in health benefit costs for 2018, the highest since 2011, according to benefit consultant Mercer, and are looking for options beyond raising deductibles or copays, which shifts the burden to employees. Five years ago, only 7 percent of companies covered telehealth visits through health insurance plans, but today, 96 percent of companies treat them like regular doctor’s visits,  according to a survey released in August by the National Business Group on Health, a nonpartisan research group. Usage rates are low, however, with only 2.5 percent of employees at companies surveyed actually using the service, because the availability is so new. “It’s becoming a more accepted practice now,” said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health. Getting more people on board is a matter of effective communication - companies that are the most proactive about publicizing telehealth to their employees tend to obtain the best response rates. Craft retailer Michaels Companies Inc, which uses the Teladoc system for its employees, has a usage rate of about 4 percent among its full-time employees. Sharon Brown, director of benefits, is encouraging workers to use it because she thinks it saves money compared with going to an emergency room or urgent care facility. “We have shift workers, and they can’t always get to the doctor when it is open,” said Brown. “They are saving time, so there’s a productivity cost. It’s less money out of their pockets for travel or lost time at work.” To reach employees this year, Brown is sending out postcards and magnets. But her most effective messaging is something she calls the Porcelain Post - messages from human resources that get taped up in bathroom stalls across their 1,300 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants. Staffing company Adecco Group AG uses the American Well system for telehealth, and the head of human resources walks around the North American headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida, handing out Starbucks gift cards to employees who have downloaded the telehealth app. It had 28 percent of U.S. employees sign up, and 55 percent used the service in its first year, for a cost savings to the employer of $130,000, said Michelle Gile, a senior vice president for American Well. Some independent research is a little less rosy. A March 2017 study in Health Affairs found that the costs of treating bronchitis and similar conditions increased by $45 per user when telehealth was involved - mostly because the availability of telehealth encouraged more doctor care, not less. Some of those seeking care did not have a regular doctor. Some were using telehealth as a precursor to an office visit, like triage, said Scott Ashwood, an associate policy researcher at the nonpartisan Rand Corporation, who led the study. The American Medical Association backs telehealth as “an ongoing evolution of new models for the delivery of care and patient-physician interactions.” But the organization also cautions that providers recognize the “limitations of the relevant technologies and take appropriate steps to overcome those limitations,” said AMA board member Jack Resneck in a 2016 statement. “It’s not for everything,” said NBGH’s Wojcik. “There are some times when you need to go see a physician in person. But for a lot of primary care situations, you can probably talk through telehealth. And I think financially, everyone wins.” ","

187,,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Armed groups in Central African Republic are using rape and sexual slavery as weapons of war in an abuse that may amount to crimes against humanity, a rights group said on Thursday. Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans have been uprooted in a conflict that broke out after the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in early 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias. Both the Seleka and the anti-balaka have sexually assaulted, raped and enslaved civilians as revenge against those believed to be supporting the other side, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. Yet not a single militant on either side of the conflict has been arrested or tried for sexual violence, HRW said. “Armed groups are using rape in a brutal, calculated way to punish and terrorise women and girls,” HRW researcher Hillary Margolis said following the release of a report documenting 305 cases of rape and sexual slavery against women and girls. “Under international law, these offences ... may be considered crimes against humanity and war crimes,” HRW said. Victims told HRW how militants often raped them in front of their children, and abused, attacked and killed their relatives. Many women and girls were whipped, tied up and burned, and gang-raped repeatedly while being held as sex slaves, HRW said. “Every day we could not rest – every day there was rape, by different fighters,” 30-year-old Jeanne, who was held captive by Seleka fighters for six months in 2014, told the rights group. Stigma, impunity for attackers and a dysfunctional justice system has prevented many victims from speaking out, HRW said. Only 11 of the 296 survivors interviewed by HRW said they had tried to seek justice, with some victims blamed for their ordeal and others told to present their attackers for arrest. Most victims said they had not received post-rape medical or mental health care - such as drugs to prevent HIV and unwanted pregnancy - due to a lack of health facilities, the cost of services or transport, and misconceptions about their options. “Every day, survivors live with the devastating aftermath of rape, and the knowledge that their attackers are walking free, perhaps holding positions of power, and to date facing no consequences whatsoever,” Margolis said in a statement. Widespread killings and rapes of civilians by militants in Central African Republic - where militia violence has risen this year - have also been documented by the United Nations and other rights groups, such as Amnesty International. The United Nations is helping the government to establish a Special Criminal Court, agreed to in 2015, to try the worst crimes committed in the landlocked nation. ","

189, ,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When disaster hits the chemical plants in Port Arthur, Texas, triggering fires like those that flared in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Hilton Kelley is the man fielding panicked calls from neighbors unsure whether they should evacuate their homes. Kelley, 57, is a well-respected figure in his community but is not a government or plant safety official. For 18 years, he has led a non-profit group based in Port Arthur that advises residents on air safety and dispatches a crew in emergencies, helping people to safety in more than 30 major fires or explosions. More than 1,500 accidents at chemical plants have been reported in the United States since 2007, and amendments to the Clean Air Act issued in the last days of former President Barack Obama’s administration would have forced plants handling risky chemicals to coordinate emergency plans with local responders. Kelley says those changes would have made his job easier by, for example, obliging plant owners to tell first responders what chemicals were on site. That would help them decide what equipment and training would be needed to help people. President Donald Trump’s administration suspended the regulations, placing them in a two-year review. Trade associations argued the new rules were inconsistent with Trump’s pledges to cut regulations and with his executive order issued in January requiring federal agencies to offset each new regulation with two deregulatory actions. The full scope of the effects of the two-for-one requirement will begin to emerge in late November, when the White House is expected to publish a list of regulations and deregulatory actions each agency has taken under the rule. A Reuters examination of rules published in the Federal Register, a U.S. government journal, shows that so far in 2017, agencies have proposed or finalized 25 deregulatory measures under the two-for-one requirement - a broad easing of rules that will affect workers from miners and farmers to pilots and crane operators. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2x8aRl3) The rollbacks will delay deadlines for farmers to comply with water quality requirements, speed up the approval process for natural gas exports, make it easier for public transportation projects to attract private financiers, and lift a rule that requires employers to disclose when they hire consultants to defeat union-organizing campaigns. A few of these measures will have minimal effect, or were planned before Trump took office. But most of the deregulatory actions dismantle rules that took years to develop. Some former agency officials, mostly from the Obama administration, have decried the rollbacks, saying the measures being targeted were aimed at protecting the public against significant health and safety threats. Industry groups, however, say many of the measures were onerous and unnecessary, and they are now using Trump’s push to cut red tape to urge agencies to delay, modify or undo rules they have long opposed. The Plastics Industry Association, representing nearly a thousand companies, for example, pressed for the removal of the Clean Air Act amendments, arguing that they would force companies to divulge sensitive information, such as improvements made after a plant accident, that would not help mitigate a disaster but could attract the interest of terrorists, said Marie Gargas, the association’s senior technical director for regulatory affairs. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the agency that serves as a clearinghouse for federal regulations, did not respond to multiple requests from Reuters for comment. But in April, Marcus Peacock, then-special adviser to OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, defended Trump’s order at a roundtable event in Washington, saying, “A lot of the deregulatory actions that people will focus on first are those that simply make it easier for people to fill out paperwork or just fill out less paperwork, probably.” Under Trump’s two-for-one-push, the Department of Labor has proposed rolling back a rule protecting workers from beryllium, an industrial metal and known carcinogen. The department said the rollback would save the shipyard and construction sectors about $11 million annually. The Abrasive Blasting Manufacturers Alliance was among the trade groups welcoming the revocation of the rule, which would have required shipyard and construction companies to train and monitor workers to help them avoid dangerous levels of beryllium exposure. The rule “imposed complex and costly regulations on abrasive blasters, despite no evidence of any beryllium-related illness in the history of the industry,” it said in a statement to Reuters. Multiple studies by occupational health and toxic chemical experts reviewed by Reuters show that exposure to beryllium dust can lead to chronic beryllium disease, a debilitating and potentially fatal lung condition. When the Labor Department under Obama issued the rule in 2015, it said even the legal level of beryllium exposure posed a “significant risk” of the disease. In proposing to revoke the rule in June, the agency, now under new political leadership, said there was “uncertainty” over the efficacy of such a measure. Allen Harville, safety chairman of United Steelworkers Local 8888 in Newport News, Virginia, says he believes dozens of his colleagues have suffered from lung diseases associated with beryllium exposure. But blood tests to confirm the link cost hundreds of dollars and are not offered at most hospitals, so few can prove it, he said. Harville said beryllium exposure isn’t limited to workers: it leaves the worksite in clouds of blasting dust and the gritty coal slag that sticks to workers’ clothes and skin, which risks exposing others. The beryllium case is one example of how the deregulatory push has angered those who want more protections. “Two-for-one is a sledgehammer that could be used to smash progress in areas they don’t like,” said David Friedman, who helped lead road safety and energy efficiency efforts at the Transportation and Energy departments during the Obama administration. Public interest groups sued Trump in February over the two-for-one deregulatory requirement, arguing it arbitrarily forces agencies to repeal regulations already deemed necessary to protect consumers and workers. Federal attorneys countered that the measure was needed to address outmoded, ineffective or overly burdensome rules. The rollbacks reflect what experts on both sides of Washington’s political divide describe as the biggest deregulatory push by the U.S. government in a generation under Trump, who said during his presidential campaign that 70 percent of federal agency regulations could be eliminated. In August, the Interior Department rescinded Obama-era regulations that clarified how much oil, gas and coal companies should pay the federal government in royalties from mineral extraction on federal land. States receive a portion of those royalties. The rule was aimed at stopping the practice of coal companies selling coal at below-market prices to their affiliated companies as a way to reduce royalty payments the companies owed, according to former Interior Department officials who worked on the rule. Rescinding the rule could save industry between $60 million and $75 million annually, according to an economic analysis the department published in August. But New Mexico and California could lose a combined $18 million in annual royalties that have been used to support schools in the two states, according to statements by the attorneys general of both states, who sued the department over the issue in April. Federal attorneys said the law was defective and companies struggled to comply with it. The National Mining Association, which represents mining companies, said abolishing the rule was consistent with the two-for-one requirement. It had argued that disputes over how much coal companies should pay in royalties are increasingly rare, so the Obama-era rule was not needed.

The fighting broke out when a Dabbashi brigade member was shot dead at a checkpoint, but the brigade’s head has said the underlying cause was the group’s move to stop the departure of migrant boats to Italy following a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. Sabratha had been the most common departure point for migrants setting off toward Italy from Libya, until a sudden drop in crossings from July. The health ministry in Tripoli said on Friday that, overall, at least 26 people including combatants had been killed and 170 wounded in nearly two weeks of fighting. ","

192, ,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"DANDONG, China (Reuters) - Seated beneath tall windows and dressed simply in singlets and trousers, North Korean painters are hard at work. The artists staple canvases to frames or copy idyllic landscapes from laptop computers. One wears headphones as he brushes a group of running horses onto his canvas. The nine men have come to the Chinese border town of Dandong from Mansudae Art Studio, North Korea’s largest producer of art. There are many outlets like this along the border; they house some of the thousands of North Korean artists who cater to burgeoning demand for their work. “Chinese have begun collecting art, and North Korean art is much easier and cheaper for them to obtain,” says Park Young-jeong, a research fellow at the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute, a Seoul-based organization. In recent years as countries have responded to North Korea’s weapons tests with sanctions, Mansudae and other art studios have increasingly played a more controversial role – helping Pyongyang raise cash abroad. North Korea has long been punished for alleged underhand dealings in minerals, finance and arms; art was seen more as a channel for mutual understanding. That is changing. Mansudae is run by the North Korean state. Its output ranges from statues of global leaders to propaganda posters, embroidery and more. It has built monuments and statues in at least 15 African countries, according to independent United Nations sanctions experts. In a report in February, they said that a part of Mansudae called Mansudae Overseas Projects was a front for the North Korean state to cash in on military deals. As well as monumental statues, they found it built military installations such as a munitions factory and bases in Namibia. A diplomat at the North Korean mission to the U.N. in Geneva said Mansudae had nothing to do with funding weapons manufacturing. No one from Mansudae could be reached. The U.N. Security Council banned Mansudae’s statue business in 2016. On Aug. 5, after Pyongyang conducted more weapons tests, the Security Council blacklisted Mansudae Art Studio, subjecting it to a global asset freeze and travel ban. Diplomats say this will prevent Mansudae from conducting business. “With this listing, anything Mansudae produces - including paintings, other artwork, monuments, buildings, and other construction - cannot be bought and should be frozen per the asset freeze,” said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a further resolution on Sept. 11, the Security Council decided that all joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals must be shut down within 120 days, or by mid-January. Exactly what the measures mean for existing Mansudae art has yet to become clear. In Beijing’s art district, a gallery called the Mansudae Art Gallery says it is the studio’s official overseas gallery. Its head insists the sanctions do not apply to it and says they have had no impact on his business. “Now more than ever we need avenues like art to create understanding between North Korea and the rest of the world,” said Ji Zhengtai. It is not possible to estimate the total value of Mansudae’s dealings, but the Security Council diplomat said the business had earned tens of millions of dollars globally. Mansudaeartsudio.com, a website in Italy which calls itself Mansudae’s “official website abroad,” says the studio is “probably the largest art production center in the world.” Mansudae’s Pyongyang studio covers 120,000 sq m (nearly 30 acres), employs about 4,000 people including around 1,000 artists, and is divided into 13 creative groups, seven manufacturing plants and more than 50 supply departments, the website says. The website is run by Pier Luigi Cecioni, who sells Mansudae works online and at fairs through what he calls an exclusive agreement with Mansudae Art Studio. He declined to say how much he sells, but in August after the sanctions on Mansudae Art Studio were announced, he told Reuters that the revenues go direct to the studio to pay for paints and equipment. Cecioni said he sells works from his personal collection, most of them bought several years ago - before sanctions on Mansudae were announced. His website makes clear that any online purchase is made with his Italian company, not Mansudae. U.N. sanctions are not retroactive. A panel of independent experts is charged with monitoring U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It reports violations and recommendations to the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee. Its reports are confidential, but the committee traditionally publishes annual reports. Hugh Griffiths, who heads the panel, declined to comment, saying “the matter is subject to an ongoing investigation.” Cecioni said, “the last thing I want is to have trouble with Italian or American authorities. I have strong contacts, especially with the Italian ones, and they help me to respect all the rules.” An Italian foreign ministry source said it is customary to keep contact with everyone who has ties to countries under sanctions, to ensure they respect Italy’s international commitments. In September, Cecioni said that he had no plans to shut down his operation. “I consider it very important to let people know that ... North Koreans do not make only bombs but also art and are common people,” he said. He postponed an exhibition of propaganda posters he had planned for September in Treviso, but said this was because Mansudae’s representatives told him they thought it unwise to showcase their anti-U.S. tone in the current climate. Word of the sanctions has been slower to reach China. A circular from its Commerce Ministry announcing the start date of the measures which included Mansudae Art Studio does not name Mansudae. Asked why not, the ministry did not respond. The Dandong center works in partnership with Mansudae, said its manager, Gai Longji. Asked on the day the sanctions took effect if they were affecting business, he did not answer directly. “We don’t do politics,” he said. “We do art.” Liaoning Sanyi, the firm behind the center, did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters spoke to at least 30 experts - collectors, art historians, academics and people who have sold North Korean art globally. Many said the market for paintings is niche and amounts to little in terms of revenue compared with the billion-plus dollars North Korea has raised every year selling coal and other minerals abroad. Even so, they say North Korean diplomats in Europe have been enthusiastic to promote art exhibitions with the simple aim of bringing in hard currency. In China, demand has really taken off. Dandong is a popular attraction for tourists who come to peep at North Koreans over the Yalu River border. Busloads of tourists show up every morning. Visitors sample a North Korean speciality of noodles in cold soup, watch North Korean women sing and dance, and buy North Korean paintings. Besides Mansudae, just about every ministry and almost all the local authorities in North Korea have an art studio, said Koen De Ceuster, a lecturer in Korean studies at Leiden University who has been studying North Korean art for over a decade. “There’s studios all across the country,” he said. Other prominent studio names include Paekho and the Central Arts Studio. Paekho, which means “white tiger” in Korean, is the biggest seller of popular paintings in Dandong, traders there said. Collectors who have dealt with Paekho say it is run by North Korea’s military - Reuters could not independently establish this. Paekho’s varied output includes propaganda posters calling for a nuclear-free world. The Dandong center that Reuters visited has hosted around 500 North Korean artists since 2014, manager Gai said. They stay for between six months and three years. Many Dandong galleries house North Korean painters. Staff there said they have sold North Korean paintings for as much as $100,000 to buyers around the world. Art experts agree the pieces can very occasionally fetch six-figure sums. Not all the proceeds go to Pyongyang. Mark-ups can reach four or five times the dealer’s purchase price, according to one Dandong dealer. While the Security Council’s Aug. 5 sanctions targeted only Mansudae, its September resolution on joint ventures also included restrictions on North Korean labor: This combination  could hurt everyone in the art business, Dandong traders say. But there are ways around the measures, they add. For instance, paintings from Mansudae could be sold under the name of an art studio that hasn’t been sanctioned. Artists come to China under cultural exchange visas, not as workers. And two businessmen said paintings have long been accepted instead of cash in the barter deals that fuel the region’s economy. At the other end of the border from Dandong in the city of Yanji, Chinese antiques dealer Zhao Xiangchen said people usually roll up a couple of paintings and carry them quietly across the border to him. His antiques stall was thick with dust as he camped in a vacant slot next door, selling the paintings online. Since the sanctions were announced, Zhao said, Chinese customs have become more vigilant. “But I’m playing the long game,” he said. “I still think there’s huge latent demand for North Korean art in the Chinese market, that’s only set to grow.” ","

Source: Barron's The seven stocks all have one-year total returns in excess of the 19.1% delivered by the S&P 500, per Morningstar. Their recent one-year total returns are, ranging upwards: 19.5% for Phillips 66, 23.4% for Honeywell, 23.8% for Wells Fargo, 30.5% for Microsoft, 38.8% for Apple, 40.3% for UnitedHealth, and 46.9% for JPMorgan Chase. These total returns partially result from high dividend yields and generous payout ratios. Referring again to the Barron's table above, and based their most recent fiscal years, the payout ratios for the seven stocks all exceed 26%, and Phillips 66 leads the field with a hefty payout ratio of 86.9%. Its recent yield of 3.1% also is the best in the group.

AAPL Total Return Price data by YCharts Nuveen fund manager James Boothe tells Barron's that tech giant Apple has the potential to boost its dividend by 10% yearly for the foreseeable future. Apple is his leading holding at 4.51% of the portfolio, per Morningstar. Boothe is particularly upbeat about the new iPhone 8, for which he expects strong sales. Another reason for investor optimism: Apple is likely to be a big beneficiary of tax reform that facilitates repatriation of its massive overseas cash hoard, worth about $216 billion. Similarly, Microsoft has about $128 billion in cash held abroad. (For more, see also: 5 Stocks That May Win Big From Tax Reform.) JPM Total Return Price data by YCharts JPMorgan Chase's outlook for continued earnings growth and dividend increases is underpinned by a strong franchise, and thus being ""very well positioned to take market share from competitors,"" as he indicates to Barron's. He also notes that, as the Federal Reserve unwinds its balance sheet, interest rates will rise, boosting bank profits, also a plus for Wells Fargo. Boothe likes the diversified business model at UnitedHealth, which extends beyond health insurance to benefits management, consulting, and managed care. He projects double-digit earnings increases, both organic and from acquisitions. Already robust dividend payouts at Phillips 66 should get a further boost from reduced capital expenditures in 2018, per Boothe.

194,Dan Mangan,10052017,CNBC,9282017,"The people who used to run Obamacare for the government are now trying to save Obamacare from the government — with a new private effort to get people to sign up for health insurance. Faced with continued hostility toward the Affordable Care Act by the Trump administration, a group of former health officials in the Obama administration on Wednesday unveiled a project called Get America Covered. The campaign will seek to build public awareness about the coming insurance enrollment season and affordability of health plans. The project comes after the Trump administration shortened the enrollment window for Obamacare plans, slashed budgets for promoting sign-ups and ordered federal officials not to participate in traditional partnerships with state-based health coverage campaigns. Get America Covered leaders are hoping to offset, at least somewhat, the potential drop-off in enrollment levels this season that could result from the Trump administration's actions. ""If the administration was committed to making sure people had the information they needed to sign up for health care, we wouldn't need to start Get America Covered,"" said campaign co-founder Lori Lodes. ""But people's lives are at stake so everyone has to step up and fill whatever gaps they can so people get the health care they need,"" said Lodes, a former communications director for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Lodes told CNBC that the campaign has an initial budget of ""six figures,"" with that funding coming from individuals, organizations and foundations, whom she declined to identify. Lodes said the campaign planned to raise additional funds from online donations. Her co-founder in Get America Covered is Joshua Peck, former chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov. That federally run Obamacare exchange sells individual private health plans in most of the country, and funnels people in the remaining states to the state-run insurance marketplaces that serve their areas. Serving as national co-chairs of Get America Covered are former CMS chief Andy Slavitt, insurance industry executive Mario Molina, the actors Alyssa Milano and Bradley Whitford, and news commentator Van Jones. Tweet In addition to reminding people of the enrollment deadline, the group said it also will be highlighting the fact that most Obamacare customers who buy coverage through a government exchange qualify for financial aid that can reduce their coverage costs to between $50 and $100 per month, or even less in some cases. Get America Covered has a relatively short window in which to get its work done. Unlike past open enrollment seasons, which spanned over months, people who want to have health coverage from a private individual plan in 2018 have half as much time to sign up this year: Nov. 1 and Dec. 15. Only people who qualify for so-called special enrollment periods can sign up after that. People who have coverage through a job, Medicare and Medicaid have different sign-up periods. The Affordable Care Act was created as a result of President Barack Obama's desire to expand health-care coverage in the United States. Since Obama signed the ACA into law in 2010, about 20 million Americans have gained insurance coverage, and the uninsured rate has fallen to record lows. Until Obama left office in January, Slavitt, Lodes, Peck and other top federal health officials had been avid promoters of ACA enrollment efforts, highlighting sign-up deadlines and touting the advantages of having coverage. The ACA requires most Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a fine. To facilitate compliance with that mandate, the ACA authorized the creation of government-run insurance exchanges, such as HealthCare.gov, which sell plans offered by private insurers. But since taking office, President Donald Trump has tried, unsuccessfully, to have Congress repeal and replace major parts of the ACA with new health-care legislation. At the same time, CMS and its parent, the Department of Health and Human Services, have gone from being the leading cheerleaders of the ACA to among its staunchest critics, issuing negative statements on the law and highlighting situations the agencies claim show Obamacare is failing. That change in tone has concerned Obamacare supporters, who fear that Americans will assume that the ACA is no longer the law, and that there is no legal obligation for them to have insurance coverage. ""We can't make up for what the [Trump] administration refuses to do,"" Peck said. But, Peck also said, ""We're taking everything we learned about how to reach people with the information they need about deadlines and financial help and are getting to work to helping more people enroll."" CMS declined to comment Wednesday when asked about the Get America Covered campaign. ",The people who used to run Obamacare are now trying to save Obamacare,0.9803
195,"Joel Landau, founder of The Allure Group",10052017,CNBC,9282017,"What do you get when an abundant demographic cohort hits the 65-year mark? A wave of baby boomers retiring in excess, to the tune of 10,000 men and women a day. That may seem like a big number, but it's accurate, according to Pew Research and the Social Security Administration. The question is: Are Americans prepared to live comfortably post-retirement? And perhaps more importantly, is the health-care industry ready for the associated medical burden? Health-care news and the costs associated with it are obviously on everyone's mind, and for good reason. As health care continues to take up a larger part of the overall economy, structural changes — such as the push toward paying for value, greater emphasis on care management and increased cost sharing with consumers — are taking a stronger hold, pulling back against rapid health-care spending growth. Retiring baby boomers will more than double Medicare and Medicaid costs by 2020, according to industry data. As health-care costs increase faster than economic growth, Medicare taxes and the Trust Fund will cover less and less. By 2033, some pundits say, the Trust Fund will be bankrupt, and taxes will pay only for 48 percent of the costs. Americans are unique in that a vast majority feel personally responsible for retirement preparation — a survey by Transamerica found that 91 percent felt very or somewhat personally responsible for post-retirement income sufficiency, versus 73 percent of workers globally. But high health-care costs in the United States make it difficult to actually be prepared. According to some industry calculations, a person with a $40,000 annual income needs $1.5 million to comfortably retire (the higher your income, the more millions you need in order to maintain your lifestyle). If that weren't steep enough, this figure doesn't include health costs. More from Active/Passive: Indexing still on top, but active management plays role Why traditional investment strategies don't work I am a lazy, cheap investor. Here's why. Since health costs rise along with age, this equation gets more problematic. The average 65-year-old couple in retirement can expect to pay $275,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for health care, according to Fidelity Investments. But by some estimates, they only have a 50 percent chance of covering these costs. According to a report by AARP, ""the U.S. stands out for the high cost of health care and its failure to generate better health outcomes."" So no matter how personally responsible emerging seniors may feel, half are likely to fall short when medical costs are concerned. There's Social Security, sure, but the reserve is expected to be depleted by 2033. The limits of Medicare and Medicaid are being tested as well. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2035 spending for Medicare alone will reach 8 percent of gross domestic product; as of 2080, that figure may be 15 percent. And since emerging retirees will both live longer and experience higher rates of hypertension, higher cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, their strain on health and finances will be prolonged. There's no easy solution, but as an entrepreneur in the health-care industry that works with seniors, I feel it's my obligation — and ours in the field collectively — to come up with solutions that strive for patient affordability and ways to actually lower costs behind the scenes. If there is an upside, it's that exorbitant health spending by baby boomers has driven innovation in health care. Not all innovation leads to lowered costs, though; in fact, sometimes the opposite can occur. As new innovations, drugs and processes are created, demand for these services rise, increasing spending by an order of magnitude. I believe smart innovations can, and should, decrease costs, too. Take, for example, the cost of latencies in medication administration, or poor coordination and collaboration between health-care providers. When services aren't streamlined or they fail to account for long-term care, health deteriorates and emergencies arise. The private sector can help by developing services and software with this in mind, filling gaps to prevent costly readmissions and cut down on waste. To put it simply: Innovative treatment is important, absolutely, but if we want to decrease costs, we should focus on streamlining care to preempt the need for expensive treatments. There's another side of this to take into account. As baby boomers retire, they don't just enter a new chapter — they leave big gaps in the workforce, and one many businesses aren't prepared for. To address the health-care industry alone, nearly two-thirds of baby boomer nurses are already considering retiring. This begs the question: When retirees need someone to care for them, will there be enough millennials and Gen Xers employed to do so? Right now the health-care industry is decidedly not adequately prepared. According to The New York Times, ""we already lack sufficient numbers of geriatricians and other professionals — nurses, social workers, pharmacists, aides — trained to care for the elderly, and the shortage is projected to increase."" We need to provide incentives to more young people to get into eldercare and nursing by any means possible. Lastly, nursing homes in the private sector are already alleviating issues for seniors by providing better and more seamless care driven by innovation. In countries such as Japan, for-profit nursing homes are picking up government slack by investing in aging boomers instead of leaving them to the whim of federal funding. Seniors in the United States have the opportunity to benefit from private solutions, as well. In the end, scalable, independent solutions will be the most reliable way for the health-care industry to stay afloat. When that wave of retirees hits — and keeps on hitting — only preparation will soften the blow. Here are some investments that are fixed, keep up with inflation, don't have risk and are offered by insurance firms. By understanding how one investment performs compared to another, you make better decisions about what's right for you. Investors consume more info than can be processed so it's important to have a decision-making process for investments.

196,Dan Mangan,10052017,CNBC,9282017,"Slightly fewer than half of all Americans were vaccinated for the flu last season, a top federal health official warned Thursday, as he called for nearly every person to get a shot by October for the coming season. ""The science on flu vaccination is clear,"" said Dr. Tom Price, secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. ""Vaccination can help prevent you or someone you love from becoming sick and missing school, or work, or worse, becoming severely ill or being hospitalized from or even dying from the flu."" The hospitalization rate last season for influenza was nearly double that of the 2015-2016 season, officials said. Price himself got vaccinated Thursday during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. Tweet He said that for this season, health officials are recommending only injectable vaccines, not nasal spray flu vaccine. ""I urge everyone 6 months and older to do the same as soon as vaccine is available in their community,"" said Price. He noted that next year is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of Spanish flu, which infected a half billion people, and killed up to 5 percent of the world's population. Data released Thursday showed that while there were slight increases in the vaccination rates among people most vulnerable to the flu — adults over age 50 — there were ""mostly stagnant vaccination rates among all age groups,"" according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. The flu vaccination rate among all Americans was 48.6 percent last season, up just 1.2 percentage points from the prior season. Among children age 6 months through 23 months, the vaccination rate was 76.3 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the only age group that exceeded the public health goal of 70 percent vaccination coverage, according to NFID. Officials said that for the 2017-2018 season, vaccine manufacturers have estimated that as many as 166 million doses of flu vaccine will be available nationally. More than 73 million doses have already been delivered. The vaccines this season have been modified to protect against the flu viruses that research suggests will be most common in coming months. Price took no questions at the news conference. The health secretary in the past week has come under heavy criticism after the news site Politico revealed he had taken 26 flights on private jets since May, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $400,000.

198,Elizabeth Gurdus,10052017,CNBC,9282017,"As the Dow Jones industrial average continues to reach intraday all-time highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer decided to look back at the stocks that drove the index's gains in the third quarter. The Dow increased by 4.9 percent in the third quarter as the stock market avoided a historically typical September downturn, so the ""Mad Money"" host examined the top 10 stocks responsible for the move. The aerospace giant contributed a massive 37.5 percent to the Dow's gain. Boeing's longer-than-expected order book, strong defense-oriented business and new Dreamliner aircraft model drove buyers to its shares, Cramer said. Caterpillar contributed 11.6 percent to the Dow last quarter. Together, Caterpillar and Boeing accounted for nearly half of the Dow's move. ""The source of CAT's strength? The company had a true blowout quarter thanks to a pickup in orders, very lean inventories and a very low table of employment. It's a big winner as China and Europe return to growth ... and you'd better believe they'll sell more equipment for the rebuild effort in the wake of the recent hurricanes here,"" Cramer said. The big bank's shares gave the Dow a 10.8 percent gain. While Goldman's management acknowledged that the bank's last quarter wasn't so great, the stock nevertheless got a boost from a softer regulatory environment and investor optimism about Goldman's future success. Chevron, an oil stock, accounted for 9 percent of the Dow's third-quarter move. Cramer attributed this to the company proving it wouldn't have a problem paying out its large dividend or surviving in a low-priced oil environment. The move in shares of this credit card giant gave the Dow a 7.8 percent boost last quarter as Visa continued riding the global shift from paper-to-plastic. ""I think what shocked people here is that the modern-day Visa was built by Charlie Scharf, who recently left that job, but his successor, Al Kelly, seems to be handling things perfectly well. I admit I was worried when Scharf left,"" Cramer said. ""I was wrong. Kelly's amazing. Visa's business is humming."" Few companies fared better than UnitedHealth when Congress failed to pass the Trump administration's plan to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare, Cramer said. The health care giant contributed 7.5 percent to the Dow's gain as it pulled out of money-losing exchanges. ""Even after this run, UNH remains one of the cheapest stocks I follow and if it ever comes down, I'd love to add it to the trust,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. After hurricane season wreaked havoc on parts of the United States, investors rushed into Home Depot's stock as a way to play the rebuilding process. The stock's boost added 7.2 percent to the Dow. The consumer technology colossus added 7.1 percent to the Dow's third-quarter move after a better-than-expected quarter and resurgence of bullish sentiment among analysts on Apple's new iPhones. After a series of disappointing quarterly earnings reports, American Express bounced back with an uptick in profitability, pushing shares upward. The stock gave the Dow 4.4 percent of its gain. Contributing 3.9 percent to the Dow's third-quarter climb, Microsoft proved that Azure was a dominant cloud-based system that helped accelerate the company's growth. ""It's become a must-own tech name for big-time portfolio managers who like growth but also want to sleep at night,"" Cramer said. All in all, Cramer learned three key things from looking at the group in its entirety: ""Put simply, these names went higher largely because they were the only game in town, cash-heavy stocks of companies that are doing better than we thought that could grow in an era of slow growth,"" Cramer said.

199,"Mike Juang, special to CNBC.com",10052017,CNBC,9282017,"It is most definitely brain surgery. The skull is opened, and electrical leads are implanted directly into the tissue of the brain. These wires are connected to a small device that sends a small dose of electricity into the brain. The treatment, called deep brain stimulation, means patients suffering from neurological disorders like Parkinson's Disease can have the chance to live a normal life without constantly fighting their own bodies. Tremors, or involuntary shaking while a limb is at rest, can be noticeably reduced or even eliminated. Patients regain mobility and are able to walk and even talk normally. YouTube is filled with hundreds of videos demonstrating the ""life-changing"" effects of a DBS device when active, as well as what patient functionality returns to when the device is turned off. Popularly known as a ""brain pacemaker,"" deep brain stimulation works by blocking errant signals from damaged brain cells to ""reset"" the brain's natural rhythm, said Dr. Michael Okun, the medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation and chairman for the Department of Neurology at the University of Florida. During surgery a hole is inserted into the patient's skull and electrical leads are implanted directly into the brain's tissue. The leads are threaded out, and the skull is closed. These wires are threaded behind the ears, down the neck and to the front chest area, where they are connected to a watch-size device that emits a controlled amount of electricity. The entire unit, from wires to generator, are all buried just below the skin. The generator, a self-contained unit with a battery, sends pulses of electricity through the leads to stimulate areas of the brain, reducing or in some cases even eliminating the most debilitating parts of the disease. A small, cellphone-size remote control can be used to adjust the ""dosage"" of electricity and can turn the device on and off. One of the major manufacturers of the device is Medtronic, which has been active in the U.S. market the longest — it first received approval for use of its DBS system for advanced Parkinson's in 2002; the FDA approved it in 2016 for use with patients who have had Parkinson's for at least four years. Abbott Laboratories acquired the DBS business with its acquisition of St. Jude Medical last year; and Boston Scientific, which currently offers its DBS system in Europe, hopes to receive U.S. approval by year-end. The three companies' business lines focused on neurology had roughly $1 billion in combined sales in the most recent reported quarter. Medtronic's brain therapies group is the leader, with $522 million in sales in the most recent quarter, though it does not break out DBS sales specifically. Abbott's neuromodulation unit had $300 million in global sales, with approximately 10 percent coming from DBS sales, but it says DBS has been growing since launching in the United States last year. Each DBS surgery can cost between $35,000 and $50,000, and upward of $70,000 to $100,000 for bilateral procedures (both sides of the brain), according to the National Parkinson Foundation. These estimates include the cost of the surgery, devices, anesthesia, hospital fees and physician fees. Device costs can run to tens of thousands of dollars: The Medtronic DBS unit costs $23,000. Since DBS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease, Medicare and most private insurance carriers will cover most, if not all, of the costs of the operation, according to NPF. Still, as with any surgery, there are risks. ""The main risk is bleeding,"" said Dr. Matthew Wodziak, a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's Disease at Loyola Medicine. ""When we find the right place to put something inside the brain, you have the risk of bleeding [and] infection,"" he said. Properly implanted leads do not cause brain damage, and only create microlesions, or small cuts in the brain tissue, and a buildup of glial tissue, cells that support neurons, Okun said. In addition to the complications associated with surgery, DBS devices also require physical maintenance. Batteries in the devices are not rechargeable and need to be replaced, Wodziak said. The hardware can wear over time and may need maintenance. Medtronic says its devices are not susceptible to hacking, and include encrypted signal technology and proprietary algorithms to communicate with remote controllers. Despite progress, experts and doctors are trying to determine exactly how electrical stimulation alleviates the symptoms of brain-related disabilities, Okun said. Doctors are still debating if DBS directly affects the function of brain cells, if it simply introduces changes in the chemical composition and biology of the brain, or some combination of the two. What they do know, Okun said, is that introducing electricity blocks the signals of cells close to the lead while stimulating the ""pipes"" connecting neuron cells, called axons. It also alters the neurochemistry of the brain, the ""ocean"" of fluid in which neurons sit. ""We're using a tiny amount of electricity to influence a large circuit that is malfunctioning, and we're trying to reset the brain,"" Okun said. The electricity restores normal oscillations of the brain, improving the patient's symptoms, he said. In the case of tremors associated with Parkinson's disease, it can make it much more manageable or even stop the tremors completely. The treatment can be used to tackle additional neurological problems and other disorders, Wodziak said, including epilepsy, seizures and dystonia, which is the sustained, involuntary contraction of muscles and can lead to painful cramping of the feet or hands, curling toes, or turning and twisting of the neck. A version of the same technology can even be used on the spinal cord. This year, Dr. Andre Machado of the Cleveland Clinic performed the first DBS surgery for stroke recovery using the Boston Scientific Vercise system. It is also considered for depression and weight loss. Although the treatment has been around since the 90's, there have been some incremental advances to the technology, including leads capable of focusing electricity to increasingly specific parts of the brain and smaller generators capable of connecting to devices using Bluetooth. Abbott's DBS system was the first to be approved in the United States with a ""directional lead,"" which allows physicians to direct current more precisely than traditional DBS. It also allows for system control from an iPod Touch. Future deep brain stimulators may even include sensors that allow it to respond dynamically to changes in brain patterns, said Brett Wall, senior vice president of brain therapies at Medtronic. The company also hopes to reduce the size of devices, eventually making generators rechargeable or even small enough to embed directly on top of the skull, Wall said. Wodziak cautioned though that the surgery is only optimal for patients that will drastically benefit from it. Due to the nature of the surgery, patients opting for DBS it must undergo a bevy of tests from an army of specialists: A neurologist and neuropsychologist to screen patients. A neurosurgeon to perform the implant. A psychiatrist and rehab team including physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists to assist recovery. The best candidates for DBS Have had PD symptoms for at least five years. Have ""on/off"" fluctuations (when a person cycles between ""on"" time, when the medication is working to control symptoms, and ""off"" time, when medication has worn off and PD symptoms return), with or without dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is involuntary, irregular, writhing movement that can range from mild to violent and can sometimes be unpredictable. Continue to have a good response to PD medications, especially carbidopa/levodopa (though the duration of response may be insufficient). Have tried different combinations of carbidopa/levodopa and dopamineagonists under the supervision of a movement disorder neurologist or specialist. Have tried other PD medications – such as entacapone, tolcapone, selegiline,apomorphine or amantadine – without beneficial results. Have PD symptoms that interfere with daily activities. Parkinson's disease patients are also advised to consult with a movement disorders specialist, a neurologist who has completed specialized training in PD and movement disorders, or in the least with neurologists in practice who have become experts in this area through their experience caring for many patients and by taking continuing medical education courses. ""We don't put it in first,"" Okun said. ""We very carefully go through an interdisciplinary evaluation, we find out what's disabling to the patient, we have to make a conscious decision; can our technology tackle all the symptoms in our patient?"" The treatment is meant to be a supplement to, and not a replacement for, medication and other treatments. Patients also need to be aware that many post-operative visits for both DBS programming and medication adjustments will be required, most frequently during the first 6 months following implantation. Many medical centers that offer DBS also require monthly visits for the first six months. DBS is removable and reversible. It's not a cure for Parkinson's Disease. Michael J. Fox, the actor who has become synonymous with the fight to find a cure for Parkinson's and whose foundation offers guidance for those considering the procedure, has spoken in the past about the potential benefits of DBS, but also its limitations. He was first diagnosed in 1991 and in the late 1990s, Fox had a type of brain surgery to relieve his tremors, a thalamotomy — which destroys a small portion of brain tissue — before DBS became an option. Fox told CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta back in 2010 about his decision to not pursue DBS: ""The next time they go in my brain, I want them to get it done. … If there is something that they can do that will be curative or restorative … in a much more fundamental way than a mechanical stop gap, a kind of pacemaker. ... That's just my personal preference, but it's been tremendous in people's lives, hundreds I've met, and thousands that have had the procedure, deep brain stimulation. It's been huge, the improvement ... the people that couldn't walk, people that had a hard time functioning.""

""The data are strong and have been strong for a long time. But all these numbers have an asterisk because of the hurricane,"" said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management. He added the numbers remain strong even after smoothing out the effects from the hurricane. ""What really matters is the [Federal Reserve] is moving away from the specific targeting of inflation. The more data like this we get, the more likely it is we not only get a December rate hike, but some serious tightening in 2018,"" Shaoul said. The major indexes all closed at record highs on Monday and Tuesday amid strong economic data. ""Volatility has also been kind of lackluster. Every day we come in and there are new highs,"" said Anthony Conroy, president at Abel Noser. ""That said, there is more room to run higher for stocks. The economy is strong, earnings are good and volatility remains low."" Also helping stocks are renewed hopes the GOP will move forward with tax reform. Last week, Republicans unveiled sweeping changes to the U.S. tax code. The proposed changes would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, is not so sure the GOP will be able to move forward with this plan, however. The plan ""is essentially an outline. The President is leaving it up to Congress to fill in the details that will make it a plan,"" he said. ""The Republicans need to make tax reform the law of the land to hold onto their slim majorities in both houses of Congress come next year's mid-term elections. They might fail as miserably on this challenge as they did on repealing and reforming Obamacare, when their majority splintered and not one Democrat in either the House or the Senate supported their effort,"" Yardeni said in a note to clients.

202,Meg Tirrell,10052017,CNBC,9282017,"Kaitlyn Johnson, a 7-year-old from outside Dallas who loves cheerleading, her science classes, and the color pink, and Justin Pritikin, a 17-year-old high school senior in New Jersey looking forward to starting college, have never met. But they've got one important thing in common: they were both among the courageous participants in clinical trials of a completely new way to treat cancer.The medicine is called Kymriah, and is among a new wave of therapies that use a patient's own cells as medicine. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Aug. 30 and heralded as a historic event in the annals of cancer treatment. Kaitlyn's and Justin's are both stories of hope. But they also illustrate the early nature of understanding of this new technology, and of how society will pay for it. The technology is CAR-T, for chimeric antigen-receptor T-cell therapy. It uses viruses to deliver genetic material to patients' immune cells, equipping them with homing devices to track down markers on cancer cells.""That is, in this way, a living therapy,"" said Dr. Jay Bradner, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. Novartis markets Kymriah. ""This growth of T-cells in the patient will allow these serial killers to take out millions of cancer cells.""The FDA cleared the medicine to treat patients up to 25 years old with acute lymphoblastic leukemia for whom other therapies have stopped working. It's a small number of patients, about 600 a year in the U.S., but a group with few other options.The agency called the approval a ""historic action… ushering in a new approach to the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.""Earlier that same week, biotechnology giant Gilead spent $11.9 billion to acquire Novartis's CAR-T competitor, Kite Pharma. Shares of Juno Therapeutics, third in line with CAR-T therapies in development, soared on news of the deal. CAR-T is the new darling of the drug industry.It's a moment years in the making. Years that Kaitlyn and Justin contributed to. But here is where their stories diverge.For Kaitlyn, the journey to CAR-T started in late 2011. She was just 18 months old when her parents, James and Mandy, noticed she had strange bruises. Then a fever. A bewildering trip to the hospital revealed the worst.""I don't even remember the doctor's name,"" Mandy recalled last week. ""I was like, 'So, does my daughter have cancer?' And she was like 'Has nobody told you yet? Yes, she does.'""Then started the two and a half years of punishing chemotherapy that's the standard of care for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer. For more than 80 percent of kids, that regimen — though grueling to get through — works. Kaitlyn was among the unlucky few for whom it didn't. Just a few months after she finished treatment, the cancer came back. ""I said, so whatever she wants to do this weekend, we're gonna do it,"" Mandy said. ""Because she's not going to be able to go back outside. She's not going to be able to play with her friends.""James said, ""We were going to return back to our old normal.""But another month of chemotherapy failed Kaitlyn too. It was then that her doctor suggested they try something very few people had: CAR-T, still in clinical trials. They were nervous, but, fueled by the hope of success stories before them, they said yes.""We were ready to throw that Hail Mary pass for treatment,"" James said. ""We had no other options."" Just weeks after Kaitlyn received her modified T-cells, James and Mandy got a late-night call from Kaitlyn's doctor. They assumed it was bad news. But it was just the opposite.""She says there's no detectable signs of cancer,"" James said. ""And I think we just cried, you know? … Within six months, our pendulum had swung from, 'We're going to lose our child, potentially,' to: 'We beat cancer.'""Three years later, Kaitlyn is still cancer free. For James and Mandy, seeing Kymriah approved was a joyful moment.It was ""very breathtaking for me,"" Mandy said. ""You know, just thinking, 'Wow, we are a part of this, you know: to help hundreds, thousands of other kids.' And I'm always thinking, 'I almost chose not to do this.'"" Fifteen hundred miles away, in New Egypt, New Jersey, Justin Pritikin was going through the same thing. For him, the journey to CAR-T started when he was 12. The years of chemotherapy — an extra year for boys, said his mother, Jill — gave him 14 months free from cancer and toxic treatment before it failed him, too. Justin enrolled in a clinical trial whose goal was to assess ways to tamp down a common, and potentially severe, side effect of CAR-T. Called cytokine release syndrome, it can result from overactivation of the immune system.It's an ""on-target risk,"" explained Dr. Gwen Nichols, chief medical officer of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, which supports research into CAR-T. ""Any time you activate the immune system, you activate a lot of chemicals in the body that help chew up the targets."" Cytokine release syndrome can lead to high fevers and organ damage, and can be life-threatening at its most serious. But researchers have found ways to control it using anti-inflammatory drugs, such as those used for rheumatoid arthritis.Justin, though, didn't experience those side effects, Jill said.""Just a little elevated temperature,"" she recalled in an interview this week.A month later, a check on Justin's bone marrow revealed the therapeutic T-cells were still active, and there were no B-cells, the target of the treatment.""This whole time he feels amazing, it was like he was back to normal,"" Jill said. ""After years of chemotherapy, it was nice to see.""But his three-month checkup wasn't as positive. The T-cells were nowhere in sight. And B-cells had started to return.It wasn't a relapse; the B-cells weren't leukemic, Jill said. But it appeared the CAR-T treatment had stopped working. The outcomes for Kaitlyn and Justin are part of the mysteries of medicine: why a cutting-edge therapy works for years for one person, and just months for another. Notably, this situation has been worked into Kymriah's pricing.  If the treatment is controlling patients' cancer after a month, its price tag is $475,000. ""The CAR-T therapy is administered to all patients who need it,"" Novartis' Bradner explained. ""If the medicine is working at a fixed period of time, then Novartis is compensated. And if it doesn't, then we feel good at having provided this chance for that patient."" Even so, the price has been a point of discussion in the industry. The cost ""definitively shattered oncology drug pricing norms,"" Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Dr. Peter Bach, Dr. Sergio Giralt, and Dr. Leonard Saltz wrote in an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week.They point out, though, Kymriah's impressive response rate of 80 percent, with 25 percent of patients seeing their cancer recur within six months, and one-year survival of 80 percent.""Alternative treatments do not achieve these types of results,"" they wrote. Still, had Justin not been accessing the drug through a clinical trial, but after it was on the market, his insurance would be on the hook for $475,000, even though the therapy appeared to stop working three months in. ""While this is a welcome innovation in reimbursement, Novartis under this arrangement would still be expected to be paid for 83% of cases (if clinical experience parallels the trial),"" the Memorial Sloan-Kettering doctors wrote. ""Alternative strategies could be used.""Jill Pritikin, though, says she still considers Justin's CAR-T therapy a success. Before he entered the trial, he wasn't well enough to attempt a stem cell transplant, another last-resort option for patients with ALL. The CAR-T helped him get well enough to try.""The T-cells, in our minds, did exactly what we needed them to: got him into strong remission without chemotherapy. And still today he's technically in remission,"" Jill said. ""That's kind of the best way to go into transplant anyway.""Justin was preparing to receive his stem cell transplant on Thursday. It's still early days for understanding CAR-T, said the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Dr. Nichols.""This is the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""This is just the beginning of a whole new era of thinking in the science of how we treat cancer.""Analysts at Cowen Research estimate the market for CAR-T therapies could reach $5 billion to $10 billion annually at its peak — if drug companies and researchers are successful in extending it to additional forms of cancer and more patients who, like Kaitlyn and Justin, run out of options among existing medicines.

203,Evelyn Cheng,10052017,CNBC,9282017,"Five Dow stocks tend to gain an average 8 to 10 percent in the fourth quarter, outperforming the overall market's gains, history shows. CNBC used Kensho, a quantitative tool used by hedge funds, to find the consistent winners in the Dow Jones industrial average between September 30 and December 31 over the last 25 years. The Dow outperformers are scattered across the health care, home improvement, technology, insurance and entertainment industries. UnitedHealth and Home Depot are the top performers, up nearly 10 percent on average, the Kensho analysis showed. Cisco Systems comes in third with an average gain of 9.76 percent in the fourth quarter. Disney gains an average 8.7 percent, while Travelers rises an average 8.1 percent. UnitedHealth, Home Depot and Disney were positive in the fourth-quarter during 80 percent or more of the last 25 years. These gains are better than the stock market's overall tendency to rise in the fourth quarter. The Dow climbs an average 5 percent, the S&P 500 gains an average of nearly 4.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite climbs more than 5 percent on average from October to December, according to Kensho analysis of the last 25 years. The small-cap Russell 2000 gains an average 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the study showed. To be sure, past performance is no predictor of future performance.

Fitness tracker company Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) announced its long-anticipated Ionic smartwatch at the end of August. While Fitbit's stock has seen a positive bump since the announcement, it is still down more than 50% over the past 12 months. FIT data by YCharts The smartwatch has an app gallery, enhanced coaching features, and a huge community of users that could be a catalyst for additional revenue growth. Read on to see how these features could benefit Fitbit investors. Image source: Fitbit In early August, Fitbit CEO James Park said that the  smartwatch would release with an app ""gallery"" with a ""select number"" of partners. Now that the smartwatch has been released, you will find it has popular functions and apps from companies including Pandora, Starbucks, Accuweather, and Strava, which is a social network for athletes. And this is just the start. In that early August call with analysts, Park talked about the Ionic's powerful software developer kit (SDK), which is a set of tools that enables programmers to create smartwatch apps. Park explained that when the company worked with UnitedHealth Group to create the Motion program for its members, it didn't have this SDK capability, and the effort to develop was considerable from both Fitbit and United Health. Having the app gallery and SDK will aid development of more health-focused apps in partnership with insurers or medical device manufacturers -- like the recently announced partnership with Dexcom -- and should drive incremental revenue. Fitbit's mission starts with, ""To empower and inspire you to live a healthier, more active life."" Fitbit reported in May 2017 that it had sold 63 million devices and had more than 50 million registered device users. Management has said that a smartwatch with coaching features could expand its user base by 40 million to 80 million people.  The Ionic is just this device. Fitstar, which is Fitbit's subscription-based fitness app, finally has a device that will make its features easier to use, be more accessible to more people, and have more specific coaching programs to attract users. The culmination of these benefits is rolled into a personalized app called Fitbit Coach and will be released in the fall. The Fitbit Coach personal training app will have introductory pricing of $7.99 per month or $39.99 per year. With Fitbit Coach, users will have workouts displayed on the device, running and walking audio coaching, and app-adjusted workouts based on their feedback. Coming in 2018, Ionic will allow you to access adidas coaching expertise. These coaching features should allow Fitbit to expand its addressable market and drive additional recurring subscription revenue through its premium apps. While the Ionic smartwatch doesn't enhance Fitbit's community features, it should attract new users and grow the overall Fitbit community. Having a large and active community attracts individual users and should also entice corporations hoping to reduce healthcare costs by giving employees Fitbits. Fitbit's corporate wellness programs accounted for less than 10% of overall revenue in 2016, but they could be a growth driver in the future and the Ionic community could be a selling point for corporations hoping to save money on healthcare. When someone buys a Fitbit device, access to the community and its features automatically comes along with it. Fitbit only releases its user community numbers annually, and at the end of 2016, the company had 23.2 million active users. This large user base makes it more likely that a friend or relative may already be on the platform, so the new Fitbit user may be able to engage with someone they know. Park said the community features benefit users by ""building healthy habits, [enabling] friendly competition and curating a supportive and positive environment.""  Fitbit Ionic smartwatch coaching features help Fitbit add incremental recurring revenue and expand its total addressable market. The app gallery and growing user community should boost partnerships with health-related companies. These are the new Ionic smartwatch features that investors should love. ","

Published on By If you thought that sparkling water was a trend that would die soon, think again. On Monday, Coca-Cola purchased mineral water brand Topo Chico for $220 million dollars. Topo Chico currently is distributed in 35 states, with almost 70 percent of its total sales in the state of Texas alone. This acquisition marked a big investment into a trend that has soda consumption at its lowest point since 1985. Coca-Cola already has two sparkling water brands: Dasani Sparkling and Smartwater sparkling. This purchase is its latest acquisition that many think can compete with big rivals like Nestle’s Perrier and Sundance Beverage Company’s LaCroix. Topo Chico, the prized mineral water brand of Mexico and the Austin craft cocktail scene, has had a long relationship with Coca-Cola. The plant that still bottles and manufactures Topo Chico since its creation bottled the first ever bottle of Coca-Cola in 1920s. Coca-Cola says they have no plans to change the location of its manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico, nor the brand’s existing image. “It’s important for us to maintain the relevance with the core Topo Chico fanbase while introducing the brand to new people,” VP of Emerging Brands Matt Hughes said. “We’ll continue to protect the prestige of the brand, which is authentic to its heritage and hip without being pretentious.” After the announcement of the acquisition, brand die hards took to Twitter to offer their two cents about the acquisition of Topo Chico by Coca-Cola. The most positive comments were about the opportunity to have Topo Chico distributed across the country so that those not located in its sales area could drink the sparkling beverage. Of course, the cult-like fan base that Topo Chico has was generally disturbed by the fact that their beverage of choice could be “corrupted” with high fructose corn syrup or the recipe changed. Plus, there’s a good old fashioned dose of twitter snarkiness at announcement of the news as well. I’m fair to partly excited about Coca Cola adding Topo Chico to the family.

Published on By Personality tests are some of the most popular posts on social media. At least once every day, I see “What Sauce Are You?” or “What Disney Princess Are You?” on my Facebook feed. Millions of people take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test each year, a more professional personality test. When you take the MBTI, you’re presented with a personality type, based on four characteristics, extrovert-introvert (E/I); sensing -intuition (S/N); thinking-feeling (T-F); and judging – perceiving (J/P). Many organizations use the MBTI in the workplace to group people into teams or to select candidates for employment. After all, wouldn’t you want an extrovert over an introvert for a sales position? But using the MBTI to make serious business decisions may not be a good idea. Here’s why. It’s unethical to use the MBTI in certain cases. According to the creators of the MBTI, “It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants. The administrator should not counsel a person to, or away from, a particular career, personal relationship or activity based solely upon type information.” Personality type does not imply competence or preference. The creators of MBTI also state this in their ethical position on the personality test. I am an introvert. I will always be an introvert. But I just found out that some of my colleagues believe I am an extrovert. I can adapt to a social or business situation to get the job done. If a job used the MBTI to place me on a team, they may see that I don’t always behave like an introvert. Similarly, a job may overlook me for a position based on my MBTI type. Either way, it’s kind of unfair. How can you use the MBTI? The MBTI can be beneficial to help people understand their own tendencies. I remember one thing from the test, a question about whether you base your decisions on how they impact others. Years ago, I would have answered that totally in the positive. I always considered others in making my decisions, whether I should or shouldn’t have.  Today, I would answer that question much differently. My understanding of boundaries is much better. Your MBTI type can be a great communication starter, especially in teams. But it shouldn’t typecast you into a particular position on the team. Employers should not be using the MBTI to pigeonhole their employees.  (BUSINESS NEWS) Remote working is increasingly more common here are some tips on how to ask your boss for flexibility. Published on By To some people, “working remotely” sounds like a code word for sitting around in your PJs watching Netflix all day. But many professionals, managers and otherwise, recognize the value of the flexibility and independence that comes with working from home occasionally. Depending on your role, your commute, and your personal life, benefits of working from home could include:
Reallocating commute time into productivity. 45 minutes each way means an hour and a half of wasted time – and you’re probably already tired by the time you get to work.
Uninterrupted periods of focused work. Coworkers are a wonderful resource for collaboration, and even friendship, but even the most awesome people can be annoying when you really, really, really need to focus.
Energizing quiet time. Introverts often underestimate how much they mentally need this, and everyone can use a reset once in a while.
More time to spend with kids/spouse/friends. Again, you can save time on your commute, and often you can rearrange your schedule to work a few hours after the kids have gone to bed/the movie is over/etc. If you’ve already made that list of benefits in your head a thousand times while knocking your head against your office desk, a work arrangement that includes remote work days is definitely something you should try, if your organization and your manager will agree to it. But for many potential remote workers, getting the boss onboard seems like an unsurmountable barrier, and they may have even made the request in the past but been denied. This article is designed to help all those interested in remote work successfully navigate that daunting process. Before we get into the details of potential concerns your boss may have, you should establish a clear reason (or reasons) why you’d like to transition to a schedule that includes working from home. If you can’t articulate this fundamental point, your boss will be much more likely to suspect that your motives are less than pure. Both personal and professional reasons are totally valid, but being totally open is the only way to set yourself up for success. With these motivations in mind, develop a proposal for your boss that focuses on how working from home will benefit your organization, not you. Your boss knows that you’re asking for this flexibility for yourself, but a happier and more productive you is way better for the company than a miserable, exhausted you. Your proposal should include a schedule or plan, and you should probably start slow with the work from home days. If your goal is to work from home two days a week, suggest spending one day at home every two weeks for a set period, like two or three months, so that your boss will have a built in trial period to agree to. A couple of pro tips: aside from ensuring that you’re in the office on important regular meeting days, you should avoid Friday as your work from home day to be sure it doesn’t look like you’re after three day weekends. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are ideal, because they’re in the middle of the week, and you may often have a lot of tasks and projects coming to a head on these days that you’ll need to focus on for completion. You also need to go out of your way to make sure your boss understands that your flexible schedule would work both ways; that is, even if you’re scheduled to work from home this Wednesday, you’ll come into the office for an important meeting or check in. Go the extra mile without being asked and your boss will have no reason to worry about flexibility. Finally, the best way to prove the value of remote work is to actually work better remotely. That means you’re in regular contact with your team and your boss, whether you’re asking questions or just sending status updates on your projects a couple of times a day. Over-communicating is important here. It also means accomplishing a little more than you might at the office, or digging a little deeper. If you finish something early, ask coworkers over chat or phone if they could use your help for an hour. Make yourself available, just as you would in the office, and no one will be left wondering what you do all day. A dedicated workspace in your home can do wonders for your productivity – it’s hard for anyone to do hard, concentrated work on their sofa with a lap desk. As the end of the established trial period approaches, it would be prudent to present your boss with a summary of your remote accomplishments over the past few months. If you’re sending regular updates, this should be easy to determine. And no matter how sure you are that you’ll love working remotely, you should be mindful of any loneliness or feelings of isolation, and address them by staying in contact with coworker friends over chat, or scheduling lunches with them once in awhile, especially if you work from home the majority of the time. If, after careful preparation and thoughtful presentation, your boss still isn’t having it, don’t be afraid to ask again in a few months. And in the meantime, you could bolster your case by taking a day or two of unscheduled time off and just working from home unasked. If you can show your boss what the company gets out of it, they’ll be hard pressed to say no.  Published on By A new trend is emerging as more fast-food restaurants are turning toward senior citizens to join their workforce rather than teens, per Bloomberg. Walmart has been hiring older workers for years and taking a lot of scrutiny over it, but according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force is changing. In the last 30 years of the 20th century, the number of workers aged 55 and older was the smallest segment of the workforce. Around 2003, this group was no longer the smallest share. Baby Boomers and Gen Xers are now living longer and working longer. The BLS estimates that the number of older Americans who will keep working after the age of 65 will grow by 4.5 percent through 2024. On the other hand, the number of teenagers expected to enter the workforce is expected to drop by 1.4 percent. Many workers in their prime are decreasing, due to the opioid epidemic, unaffordable childcare, and the incarceration rate, which some experts say is beginning to creating a labor shortage. In addition, seniors often have soft skills that teenagers just don’t have. After years in any industry, older Americans know how to be on time, deal with customers and navigate the ins and outs of working. Managers have to teach these skills to teenagers entering the job market. For seniors seeking work in fast food, they aren’t typically interested in moving up the corporate ladder. Financially, it can make sense for a business to hire an older worker over a teenager. A business gets the experience of age without having to pay any more for it. Would your business benefit? We recently reported on the litigation regarding the word “overqualified” being a code word for “too old to hire.” There’s also a concern that older Americans will carry a higher cost or not stay in a position for a long time, but it’s time to kick those stereotypes out.

206,Asit Sharma,10052017,Fool,9282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Tiffany & Company (NYSE:TIF) has a 180 year history as a luxury brand, and the stock has jumped 30% in the last year. They also look at the latest acquisitions from leading consumer brands this week, including Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) $220 million purchase of Topo Chico and Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) acquisition of a New York City start-up. A full transcript follows the video. Asit Sharma: Hey, Vince! Thanks as always for having me back! Shen: Sure. Fools, we're going to turn our attention to the high-end luxury corner of the consumer retail world for this episode. If we watch the clock and we have enough time, we'll also offer some quick updates on the back half of this show as well. The company states outright in its 10-K that the brand is its single most important asset, and it'll invest heavily to maintain it brand perception. That means premium customer service, paying for spots for its stores in high-end malls and luxury areas, selling lots of expensive diamonds and precious stones. Jewelry makes up 90% of the company's business, specifically products with diamonds make up almost 60% of annual revenue. Asit, the stock is up about 30% in the last year, handily outperforming the broad market. Can you tell us about some of the latest developments at the company? Sharma: Sure. The most important development begins with the top line. Sales have dropped about 6% over the last two years. In 2015, Tiffany & Company booked $4.25 billion in sales, and that's dropped over the last two years to about $4 billion in 2016. So as a result, Tiffany replaced its CEO Frederic Cumenal, who was only there for 22 months, with Alessandro Bogliolo in July. Shen: Good timing there. Sharma: Tiffany & Company, the next CEO you hire, can you please give us a name that's easier to pronounce? But having said that, Bogliolo is the former CEO of Italian jeans and fashion house Diesel Clothing Company, and he also had a long stint in Bulgari & Company, which, for those of you who love high-end fashion and maybe live in a big city, New York, Chicago, you've certainly seen these beautiful stores and their beautiful products, a worthy competitor to Tiffany & Company. So Bogliolo's mission is to expand Tiffany's cachet, as Vinyce mentioned, to a younger demographic, to millennials, to revitalize the brand without impacting that strong resonance it has as an aspirational brand, and a brand that, at the end of the day, stands the test of time. So those are the most recent developments for Tiffany & Company. Shen: I would say, the timing there, by the way, you mentioned, of the CEO was perfect, because his official start date happened to be yesterday. As we watch the progress the company makes, it's really starting day one right now. Some big opportunities that you see management mention and see them play out in the numbers a bit, there's this new leadership change, they talk about new product categories that are intended to appeal to some of those younger consumers that you mentioned, they talk about the growth of their online sales, which are still a small portion of the company's business at this point, I believe 6% as of the end of their physical 2016. Then, they also have their international footprint to lean on. You'll see that going back to some of the quarterly reports, you'll notice a trend in that the Asian markets, which the company breaks down into Japan and Asia Pacific. And for that Asia Pacific region, China makes up over half of that, those regions have tended to deliver strong results, either flat or positive growth compared to some of the declines in the company's biggest market, the Americas and the U.S. specifically, which makes up almost half of all revenue. I feel like a company like this will face some cyclical challenges in that economic downturns will often hurt luxury sales. The company struggled a bit during the financial crisis. But another long-term headwind that I want to focus on is something you mentioned, and it's kind of topic on people's minds right now, and that seems to be decreasing interest in diamonds, especially among younger consumers. With some of the controversies surrounding sourcing for precious stones, for example, with conflict diamonds, and in general, we've talked in other industries, whether it's with restaurants, consumer packaged goods, snacks, beverages, whatever it may be, people are worried about environmental concerns, sourcing, sustainability. And that seems to be flowing into this business as well. What is the company really facing here? Sharma: The company is facing a similar problem that we've seen in many industries that we talk about here where consumer goods stands. We'll talk about Coca-Cola a little bit later in this show, but that's a great analog. Coca-Cola has been impacted by changing consumer tastes, the fact that if you have small children and you've grown up in this society and have a more sustainable bent about you and are more health conscious, you're not necessarily going to give your kids as much of that beverage, Coca-Cola, as you drank when you were small. The same with Tiffany -- we have these mini cycles ... larger ways where consumers' perceptions of the brand and what's behind the brand evolve. And for Tiffany, it has to be careful about the sourcing of its diamonds, and it has to show the consumer that they can enjoy the products, that is the aesthetic quality of the product, the brand cachet, but also feel good about the provenance of that. Where did the diamond come from? Is it responsibly sourced? Is it a blood diamond? So that's a drag that Tiffany is going to have to meet and continue to have a brand perception that customers can feel good about. I think they can beat that challenge. What's interesting to me is, it's going all the way to the other extreme to deal with a little bit less high-margin revenue from the retail diamonds in that it's in the wholesale diamond business. This is something that I really wasn't as much aware of until I was doing prep for this segment. The company has a fast-growing business, particularly in Asia, in the wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's got a much smaller margin than the luxury jewelry, the pendant necklace that you buy at their flagship stores. However, in these last two quarters, the company has booked $61 million of revenue from wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's only 3% of Tiffany & Company's total revenue over the last two quarters, of that $1.8 billion I mentioned. But it's growing at a 50% clip year over year. So you can see how, within a few quarters, if it can maintain that focus, this low margin part of the diamond trade will be a bigger portion of the company's bottom line, a little bit of a drag on earnings but it's a smart way, just as Coca-Cola has moved away from only selling those sugary sodas, and as we'll talk about a little bit later, and is moving into some other types of products that customers can feel better about. Shen: Why don't we just jump right into that, Asit? I think this is going to be a focus for the new CEO as he heads up the operations for the company. Can you tell us a little bit about what the company is expanding into, but also trying to help, in terms of appealing to the young consumers that it wants to bring on board? Sharma: Sure. It's two big picture avenues that Tiffany & Company is taking. One, like other companies of its ilk in many industries, it's firming up its approach to e-commerce. And this is one industry which, you can see Amazon.com is not as much of a threat as it is with so many companies we talk about on this show. It almost seems that, whatever segment we have, Vince, Amazon looms large. Shen: Yeah, absolutely. Sharma: Tiffany & Company has a really nice e-commerce portal that tries to recreate the experience of being in the stores. It's difficult, let's be honest, to match the experience. If you've had the opportunity to walk into one of their larger stores, it's impossible to actually recreate that. But you can recreate some of the ambience, some of the desire around the product. And what I love about this is, Tiffany & Company has done a smart job of breaking its products into different pricing. Very quickly, when you visit the homepage after a click or two, it just flat-out gives you the choice -- here are products under $250, then it gradates up to $1,000, $2,500, and beyond, sort of like when you sort on Amazon, which, I'm somewhat cheap on some things, so I will often sort by price. You don't feel like you've lost luxury of experience, but you can quickly go to the price point that interests you, and I think that's a really good approach on their part and will increase the flow of millennial traffic. Millennials as a whole, I don't think they're cheap like me, I'm a bit older, but I think they're thrifty. They know what they want, and they know how much they're willing to pay for certain products, especially luxury items of the type that Tiffany sells. So that flow going through their portal to completing that, converting that customer, is pretty well done. The other thing that the company is also pragmatically undertaking is its product line. They're moving more into products like watches. This year, they will improve and expand their women's line of watches, which is a huge market. The current CEO has experience with that. For those of you who are into the fashion house of Diesel, you know that they have very attractive watch offerings. So not simply price points, but looking at what millennials buy, what's important to them. They may not be in the market for a beautiful diamond or heart-shaped brooch like your grandmother was, but they could use a watch because they're tired of staring into their phone for hours a day. Shen: Sure. I think that's a piece of the strategy the company will have going forward. At the same time, I'm a little bit skeptical, when we were doing research for this, I found a lot of headlines talking about how high-end jewelry, diamonds are on this strong downward trend in terms of popularity, like we mentioned, with millennials and younger consumers in general. But I feel like, with a company like Tiffany, with a very aspirational brand, they talk about how they will invest in their inventory to have lots of very pricey and extravagant diamonds and precious gemstones, because they want customers to go into the store and feel like there are things that they cannot afford. It's aspirational. And I feel like that's something for young consumers that they will grow into over time as their tastes change and mature, as they grow older. I think the long-term picture for this company, there are always going to be people who appreciate what Tiffany represents in terms of the luxury world. So it will always have that moat. Any final thoughts from you, Asit, in terms of this challenge the company faces, and thoughts on what the outlook might be? Sharma: I think the company will be able to meet the challenges we talked about earlier. And also, these declining trends of interest in diamonds. That's somewhat geographically based. In the United States, we have a very advanced society on the curve of industrial development. But again, in China, if you look at India, which has a burgeoning middle class, and they love to buy gold objects, diamonds are the next step up. There is a market out there. It depends on where their focus is, and the company avidly seeks locations in Southeast Asia to expand. So they know where their future customers, who will still be interested in diamonds, exist. And I think that's simply numbers for them, that's one way they'll be able to counteract the trends that we see in places like Europe and the United States, where that interest is somewhat declining. Shen: Perfect. Thank you, Asit. For our next update here, we have two stories. The first is with Coca-Cola. They opened the week with the news that the company would be acquiring Topo Chico for over $200 million. I've never had a chance to try its products myself, but Topo Chico is an imported sparkling water brand from Mexico that's very popular in selected regions of the country, especially Texas, which makes up about 70% of Topo Chico's sales. The brand has a long history dating back over 100 years to 1895, and it seems to be a big part of its allure and popularity with consumers. Asit, this deal is made as part of Coca-Cola's Venturing & Emerging Brands unit. We've talked about this unit before, it's a really interesting part of the company. Can you tell us about this unit within the Coca-Cola umbrella? Sharma: Sure. VEB, Venturing & Emerging Brands group, functions as a venture capital arm within Coca-Cola. Their mission is to go out into very far reaches of the soft drink or beverage world and find companies that are developing brand which Coca-Cola can buy. Now, for Coca-Cola to buy a brand, it really has to have $10 to $20 million in sales. Then, it can scale those sales up to $200 million and beyond. But VEB doesn't necessarily have to find companies that are selling that much from the outset. They really take an ear-to-the-ground approach and try to meet with small companies when they're just forming up in start-up phase, and keep in touch with them, as many venture capitalists do with technology companies, in the hopes that they find a brand or label just starting to gain traction, and they have the advantage of the first-mover, they have a relationship with the entrepreneurs and can write a big check, acquire the rights, and then scale. I think this group has been effective. Some of you drink Honest Tea, that was a transaction that the VEB Group consummated. And this week's transaction, also consummated by the VEB Group, they did it with the Mexican bottler ARCA Continental for $220 million. And this is interesting for those who are wondering how Coke will parlay the strategy of small, tuck-in acquisitions. Previously, Coca-Cola was buying up some small labels and manufacturing product. But the company has sold its bottling operations over the past year to bottling partners in North America and throughout the world. And by next year, Coca-Cola is going to exist more as a marketing company than an actual manufacturer. And this is one of the first transactions we see how great that business model is, because Coca-Cola actually acquired the rights to Topo Chico rather than buying all of the manufacturing and trying to go bottle this product itself. Shen: Yeah. I want to mention a few other aspects of how the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit approaches its investments, and kind of apply that to this latest purchase that they've made for about $220 million. So the unit was established in 2007, and they're looking for these potential billion-dollar brands. But the thing is, they're focused on products that are outside of Coca-Cola's traditional carbonated soda and sugary beverages, because the business unit claims to think five to 10 years ahead about where the beverage industry is going, and the signs of the leaves seem to point away from some of those traditional Coca-Cola sodas. And you mentioned Honest Tea, for example, this was a pretty early success for the company. They made an initial investment of over $40 million in 2008 when the company had less than 100 employees and just $30 million in revenue. Almost a decade later, Coca-Cola has totally taken over the Honest Tea brand, and the latest number from 2015 puts Honest Tea sales at almost $180 million. So the formula here is, they have Phase I, they identify the opportunities. Phase II, they take a venture capital role and make that initial investment. And that seems to be where we are here with Topo Chico. The next phase, then, is when they start taking a greater role and usually a bigger investment as the brand grows its reach. This seems to be a pretty standard formula for the company, in terms of what options they have for Topo Chico. It has 70% of its sales in Texas, it has really strong market share there, and management has actually spoken to this idea about recreating this success and building more ""Texases"", basically growing Coca-Cola's share of the still-growing sparkling water industry, which at this point is still dominated by private label store brands that you might see at the grocery store, for example. Estimates I found pinned Topo Chico revenue at less than $70 million for 2016. So we know this is not exactly moving the needle for a company this size. Coca-Cola, keep in mind, despite the fact that their revenue is going down because of this restructuring they've done, you mentioned in terms of the bottling operations, they still had almost $40 billion in sales in the last 12 months. I think, basically, you have to think about what the company is going to be able to leverage, and I think Coca-Cola is legendary in terms of its ability to leverage its marketing machine, and allow Topo Chico to ride that and scale. Even though it's only available in 35 states and regions of Northern Mexico already, the brand is not that familiar outside of Texas. And I'm sure Coca-Cola will be working a lot to remedy that. But if you are a Coca-Cola shareholder or you're considering a position in the company and you're trying to adopt a Foolish long-term perspective, I guess the question becomes, do these satellite brands and venture capital-like investments have the ability to eventually offset some of the major declines that are expected with traditional soda consumption? What do you think, Asit? Sharma: In this case, it certainly does. Very interestingly, as you mentioned, revenues for Topo Chico are 70% in Texas. You can visualize a small band on the map of the U.S. border, this drink is actually manufactured in Northern Mexico, and it's sold in Northern Mexico. South of Northern Mexico and north of Texas, there's tremendous potential. Some of our listeners may know, Mexico is the second largest market for Coca-Cola outside of the United States, and Coca-Cola has been hit hard by Mexican government tariffs on sugary soft drinks. So this is an excellent way for Coca-Cola not just to take an exciting brand and scale it but to make up for lost revenue. It's exactly what you want to see as a long-term shareholder. What's the strategy to replace the declining revenue? And that is such an opportunity that falls into Coke's hands. I don't how many of our listeners, maybe you can tweet to us if you've tried it, those of you who are down deep in the South -- I've tried it. I've got my hands on some several months ago from my local Latin American store. It's an interesting drink. It has a very colorful label. Effervescence is a little bit higher than sparkling waters you might buy here, at least to me. It's got a little bit of a salt taste to it. So it's something that offers a different segment opportunity for Coca-Cola, a new brand that they can push out there, and it's beloved by hipsters in Texas. So, there's that cachet that we talked about with Tiffany. They may have some hipster cachet that they can expand on. I think it absolutely does fulfill that problem that you mentioned, Vince. We'll watch this one to see how far they can scale it in the next few years, for sure. Shen: I think it's interesting, that popularity that it has in Texas, has a lot to do, I think, with the heritage of the brand itself, again, dating back over 100 years. The company, in the release, there's a Q&A with some executives from the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit talking about how important it is for them to maintain that heritage and tradition for this brand, despite the fact that they're going to be putting it into the machine and expanding its presence across the country. We'll be watching to see what kind of success they have, whether this can be a next Honest Tea for them. But ultimately, this unit within Coca-Cola has invested in over something like 40 different brands at this point. Not every single one is going to be a major success, but if we know anything about this company, they certainly have the resources and the experience in beverages to experiment and test and find these small labels and help turn them into enormous successes. For our last story, it's yet another recent development from Wal-Mart. I know we've been hitting a lot of Wal-Mart coverage on the show lately, so I'll tentatively promise that this will be the last bit for the king of retail for at least a few weeks, if not a few months. But I won't deny that it's been pretty fascinating to follow along with the various experiments and new initiatives that Marc Lore has rolled out as the head of the company's e-commerce efforts. That's not to mention what Wal-Mart has done with the Jet.com business itself. The company actually announced this morning that it would be acquiring a small start-up called Parcel. What's the story here, Asit? Sharma: Parcel is, like you say, a small company that focuses on last mile and same day delivery in New York City. The transaction size was not disclosed, but it is said to be about $10 million. So you can imagine, this is a very tiny company. What would Wal-Mart want to do with a company that it can purchase for $10 million that's located in New York City of all places, a very dense city? The answer is that last-mile services are the hardest part of the logistics supply chain, the most expensive part pound-for-pound. Amazon.com, a fierce competitor to Wal-Mart, has partnered up with the United States Postal Service to solve last mile problems. But what's so interesting is, in New York City, there's a lot of opportunity for Jet.com to basically be a test kitchen for different ventures. And Parcel helps Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired, listeners will remember, for $3 billion. Parcel helps Jet.com test delivery services within dense populations like New York City. So we should talk about Uniquely J, which is Jet.com's answer to the Whole Foods-Amazon.com partnership. Uniquely J is a service developed by Jet.com to offer high-end food products and also products such as cleaning supplies, bath tissues, to customers for delivery, probably within that same two-hour window that Amazon.com promises. Parcel lets Jet.com make that last mile delivery, and it gives this experimental template for Wal-Mart to go into big cities where it doesn't necessarily want to put a Supercenter -- places like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago -- and have a supplemental business model while also trying to kick Amazon.com in the shins. Shen: I think this is where everything comes together. We have this small start-up logistics company to help organize same-day deliveries for New York City. It has some of the infrastructure, the staff, and experience in the city to ramp up the potential same-day shipping efforts for Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com in that market. At the same time, I believe that Parcel is already handling some of the deliveries, for example, for Bonobos, which also happened to be acquired by Wal-Mart earlier this year. And that becomes part of this overall plan where everything is starting to come together a little bit for the company's e-commerce efforts. They talk about the Bonobos and Modcloth acquisitions, these are men's and women's apparel companies. Now, Wal-Mart has recently announced that they intend to make both those brands available on Jet.com. So Jet.com previously having more of a discount reputation, they're starting to offer those two brands on there, raising the cachet, again, another time that we're using that, the brand premium that's associated with the site. And with Uniquely J, they've also mentioned that this private label Jet.com brand that's going to roll out with consumer staples in the next couple of months, they want it to target some of these urban-based millennials. So they'll get a similar theme here, because these Uniquely J products are supposed to be higher-end to appeal to that target market. Again, as you mentioned, this really follows closely on the heels of Amazon, which has made its 365 by Whole Foods products available online, and the initial reports for that said it was met with great success, a lot of items selling out very quickly. So we've spoken previously about the solid growth Wal-Mart is enjoying in its digital business. I ultimately believe this is still a marathon. These are all small moves on the chessboard for the company. Ultimately, Wal-Mart wants to widen its appeal with the help of Jet.com, and its reputation as a younger, cooler brand while establishing the necessary infrastructure and logistics it will need to provide greater convenience to customers in these various urban markets, obviously starting first with this one Parcel deal right in New York City. Any other takeaways for you, Asit, in terms of what this spells for the future, in terms of this arms race between the big retailers? Sharma: Sure, one last point. And by the way, what a great example, because these are two grand masters that are playing a very long game of chess. I was really intrigued by this acquisition, because Wal-Mart is taking such a different approach than Amazon. Everyone knows Amazon builds fulfillment centers every year all across the U.S. from the ground up, supplies them with amazing automation and technology. Wal-Mart is picking up on something that I was actually reading about in Supply Chain Newsletter several months ago, that there's a ton of warehouse space in cities like New York, in Brooklyn, where I believe Parcel is based, in Chicago, in almost any big city you can think of. You've seen how urban drift has created this. It's space that's unleased, perfectly usable, and very capital-lite for a company like Wal-Mart. So it's developing a model where it can have its own quasi-fulfillment centers which are just in big cities to deliver that last mile much more cheaply than if it tried to compete with Amazon and think of itself as a company that's going to build a bunch of its own fulfillment centers. Of course, Wal-Mart thinks that its super stores themselves are quasi-fulfillment centers, and they have a point, because they're so large. But I'm intrigued from the real estate aspect of this. Again, if this is a chess move, to me, this is equal to a threat on the chessboard. It's like calling check, and the other opponent over time is going to have to make sure that his king is well-protected. So we'll follow that as well. Shen: Thank you very much, Asit, for joining me on the show today. Thank you, Fools, for listening. If you have any thoughts on Topo Chico, if you've tried it, we'd love to hear from you.

    What Does the Future Hold for Tiffany & Co.? -- The Motley Fool

  ",1.0
207,Sean Williams,10052017,Fool,9282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's tough to say whether there's one piece of legislation on Donald Trump's ""to-do list"" that takes precedence over all others, but tax reform could be the centerpiece legislation that defines his presidency. During his campaign, Trump pounded the table on individual and corporate tax reforms. On the individual side, he suggested that he'd like to see the number of income-tax brackets narrowed from seven to three and said individual income taxes should be simplified by slashing the number of credits and deductions. In lieu of fewer credits and deductions, Trump proposed doubling, or more than doubling, the standard deduction. Image source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security via Flickr. But the foundation of Trump's tax reform plan has always involved a major cut to corporate income-tax rates from their current peak levels of 35% -- one of the highest in the world -- to 15%. This 15% rate is what the president referred to as ""ideal,"" but it was considered a major stretch by lawmakers. In fact, the initial details of Trump's tax plan released this past week suggest lawmakers may aim for a 20% corporate tax rate. The reason corporate income-tax cuts are so crucial is that corporations play a critical role in boosting long-term economic growth. The hypothesis is that cutting corporate income-tax rates will allow businesses to reinvest in new technology, hire new employees, and pay higher wages. A more business-friendly tax system could also encourage domestic companies not to move production overseas, and it might even spur more foreign investment in the United States. Hypothetically speaking, in order for Trump to balance out a corporate income-tax cut to 15%, he'd need to find a way to come up with $2 trillion over the next 10 years. That's the amount such a tax cut would reduce federal revenue over the following 10 years, according to the Tax Foundation. The reason Republicans need to make up this lost revenue is because they probably have no chance of passing tax reforms with a 60% majority in the Senate. Thus budget reconciliation, which only requires a majority vote, is the likeliest way to pass a tax-reform bill. Under reconciliation, the bill will have to be revenue-neutral. In short, the GOP would need to find a way to come up with, or save, $2 trillion over the next 10 years. Image source: Getty Images. If we break things down into their most basic components, the Trump administration could do two things: make serious cuts in order to reduce spending or raise additional revenue via higher tax rates in certain situations. Chances are we'd see a combination of the two. What might be cut? To begin with, Trump's budget proposal showed a marked decline in funding for a number of federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department, to name a few. But budget cuts to these agencies are peanuts when we're talking about an estimated $2 trillion revenue reduction. Further, healthcare reform is off the table for this year. Republicans and Trump had been counting on some $100 billion to $300 billion in 10-year savings from the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, but they're not going to get it -- at least not this year. The entities that would likely pay the most to achieve that 15% corporate tax rate are the corporations themselves and homeowners. First, the Trump administration could remove the subsidy corporations receive in the form of interest being treated as a deductible expense. According to the Tax Policy Center, eliminating the deductibility of interest on corporate debt could save the federal government about $700 billion over the next 10 years. That would pay for roughly 35% of the corporate tax cut right there, and it may even receive bipartisan support. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to cutting expenditures, the Trump administration could look to boost tax rates in certain situations in order to increase revenue for the federal government over the next decade. Working Americans and investors could be among those who are in line for tax hikes. According to a report from Politico, some lawmakers in Washington have considered an adjustment to how employer-sponsored 401(k)s are taxed. 401(ks) are tax-deferred retirement plans that are funded by pre-tax dollars, meaning workers only pay tax when they begin making withdrawals during retirement. It also means contributions can reduce current-year liability for some workers. Around 55 million workers had more than $5 trillion invested in 401(k)s as of March 2017. The rumor had been that the GOP was considering taxing 401(k) contributions up front instead of when workers begin taking withdrawals during retirement. Doing so would generate extra cash for the federal government now and potentially leave them shorthanded many years down the road. According to the details of this past week's tax plan, the tax treatment of 401(k)s wouldn't change, but the idea may still be on the table. Image source: Getty Images. The other possibility is that Republicans could consider lifting the tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, which might also find bipartisan support. Currently, long-term capital gains tax rates for the wealthiest Americans (20%) are nearly half of their peak ordinary income tax rate (39.6%). You see, the wealthy are the most likely to benefit by owning stocks and receiving dividend income, so increasing the taxes on capital gains or dividend income -- perhaps to the ordinary income-tax rate -- would be more likely to require the wealthy to pay more than lower- or middle-income Americans. It's worth remembering that this is merely a hypothetical look at what could happen with tax reform if the ""ideal"" corporate tax rate were targeted, and we're likely to see changes to Trump's outlined tax plan in the weeks and months to come. Therefore it's important to keep your eyes open and ears to the ground to understand best how tax reforms could impact you. ","

208,Motley Fool Staff,10052017,Fool,9282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Lee Burbage: Oh, yes? Kara Chambers: I feel so honored. Thank you. Gardner: ... a third time. Burbage: My jacket fits perfectly. Thank you for that. Gardner: I think it's nice, Kara, that you said, ""honored."" I'm not sure it's even an honorable thing, but I appreciate that you would think that it is. I like to think in my better days that it is and thank you both for being with me this week. We're here to talk about culture and what it's like to work in the place that you work. And at The Motley Fool, when we started 24 years ago, what we had right, and the good news is, we were trying from the get-go to create a place that people would want to come to work each day. And why was that? Well, it's because there were two brothers and a friend of theirs. And they started the company. And when it came time to hire really their first non-founder employee, we didn't have a budget to go search. There was no LinkedIn. Actually, even the World Wide Web wasn't around quite yet. So who did we hire, right? We hired our fun friend from college. Or high school. We hired people we knew. And if you're going to hire people that you know at the start of your business, you're probably going to want to make it kind of a fun place to work. You're not probably going to count hours on them, or start counting vacation days. Some of the things that were very countercultural back then still are, as you both know, better than I do. Still countercultural today. It just came to us naturally because of the circumstance by which we started. So that's what we had right. What we didn't have right -- not that it was wrong -- but we didn't yet have the sense that culture was a thing. That that would be how these days people think about their workplace. There wouldn't be workshops, or keynote speeches about culture. There wouldn't be culture Fools. There weren't back then, but there are now, and I'm joined by them today, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, respectively. Kara, how long have you been at the Fool? Chambers: Almost 12 years. Gardner: Awesome. Lee? Burbage: Almost 19 years. Gardner: So that's 31, which is more than I've been at the Fool, and both of you are leaders and have helped steer The Motley Fool's culture to become one of the more acclaimed workplaces in America. A little bit of bragging -- I'm not reading from any brag sheet here -- but a couple of times in the last five years Glassdoor.com, the site that has employees rate their workplaces, has had The Motley Fool as the No. 1 place to work for small to medium-size companies in America, so there's a lot of competition. I'm imagining there's at least 10,000 other players out there. Chambers: We're going to talk about well-being. Overall well-being. We have a very highly engaged wellness program at the Fool, but that's part of a larger team. We call ourselves ""the thriving Fools."" We focus on the overall well-being of the individual and just thinking about growth and happiness at work. It's just -- many facets to well-being at work, so we're going to talk a little bit today about the different things we do. Gardner: Awesome! I was trying to establish a little bit of that humbly, because I'm trying to strike the right balance here. We put these ideas forward with humility, but I also want to say that we do put it forward with some authority as well. The Motley Fool, in the Washington, D.C. area, recently got an acclaim, Lee. Gardner: Did we receive an accolade as No. 1 for a certain thing in the last six weeks? Burbage: Yes, we did, David. The healthiest place to work. The most fun. What were the exact words, Kara? Chambers: I think we're the ""most athletic."" Burbage: The most athletic place to work in the D.C. area. Gardner: And I think it was funny, Lee, that you didn't even exactly remember that. Burbage: We win a lot of awards. Gardner: There are those of us who aren't that athletic, like, for example, me. I take great pride. Like I put up the strong-arm emoji on Twitter and say, ""We are the most athletic place to work in Washington, D.C. In the nation's capital."" Burbage: That's correct. Gardner: So whether or not Lee actually knew that, Kara, I'm glad that you did, and you and I similarly, unathletically, take great pride in that. So that's one form of well-being, but I know we're going to talk about others. Without further ado, let's get started. You both have brought some points, as you have in previous appearances. I think you have eight today, so we're going to bounce it back and forth. Who's up first? Chambers: I am. We're going to start with what we call our Bookie Monster program. We went through a very rigorous naming process for that program and just named it Bookie Monster. It's any business book you can request. We have a huge library here at the Fool just sitting there. That just opens up people to explore different topics. We'll talk about this more, but she focuses a lot on when your mind is in ""discover mode,"" when you're feeling good and you're happy, you're going to outperform. And the opposite, when you're stressed, when you're tired, when you're physically or emotionally drained, that's called ""defensive mode,"" and you're less able to learn, less able to solve complex problems. That book really helped to focus, at least me and my team, on this type of work. Gardner: So, Kara, the theme again is overall well-being. So while we did lead with the strong-arm emoji and the word ""athletic,"" you went right to books and reading and the life of the mind. The overall well-being of the Fool. How does the program work? Do people get books for free here? Chambers: They do. They just send an email to Bookie Monster and Bookie Monster will reply back and say, ""I have your book at the front desk."" It's magic. Gardner: Does that mean if I'm kind of a country wit -- I don't work at the Fool but I'm listening to this podcast -- I can just drop an email to bookiemonster@fool.com? Chambers: Oh, no, no! I'm going to check with our CFO first. Gardner: Ah! I thought I found a loophole. Chambers: You could try! Gardner: So is this a program that is well used? Chambers: It's very popular. And it's fun to walk past the front desk. You see the books waiting to be picked up by somebody. You can chat with them in the hallway and say, ""Hey, I just saw you pick that up. How is that one?"" It brings a culture of reading and learning to this office. Gardner: Out of curiosity, because I'm going to be playing the role of, occasionally this week, the small-business entrepreneur. Maybe I have five to 10 employees. Maybe I'm a Realtor and I have my team. We're not The Motley Fool with 300 employees and the kinds of resources that you might be talking about. What is the rough expense I should expect if I were to open up my own Bookie Monster? Per employee, let's say. Chambers: That's a good question. I want to say an Amazon book is maybe $15 and maybe the average person can read a book a month ... Gardner: That's way beyond the average American. Did you know that the average American has not read a book this year? Chambers: Oh, no! Gardner: And I'm not here to dump on my fellow Americans, because there are a lot of great ones, but studies that I've seen suggest that adults, most, don't actually read a full book in a year. Chambers: That's possible. Gardner: So it's possible that I, with my small business, might have a less active Bookie Monster, so it's even cheaper than what you're suggesting. But if I'm doing the math right, 12 times 15-ish is $180 a year ... Chambers: Yeah. Gardner: ... per employee. Burbage: Before I order a book, I go to our internal library and look on the shelf first, to see if it's there. And I'm going to say that fairly frequently I can find a book already. So we encourage people, when you order a book, after you read it, to put it in the library, and then others can use it, and that helps defer costs. Gardner: Awesome. And the last question before we move to Point No. 2. Kara, it's for business books, right? Chambers: Correct. It is broadly. Gardner: What is not a business book? How about that? Gardner: George R.R. Martin has not yet written, although he probably should, maybe has, a business book. Chambers: Business lessons in there that are terrifying. Gardner: OK, good. Lee? Point No. 2. Burbage: So another, it's along the lines of reading in terms of sort of opening up your mind. I think it's easy to get trapped in your day-to-day work and inside the walls of your company, and so we're encouraging people to sort of think outside. And so one way to do that is to bring outside speakers in. And so we encourage Fools at any level -- let's say you've read a book and you're interested in the author. We will reach out to that author and say, ""Hey, would you stop by and visit us?"" What we find is that people will often say yes. They're happy to come in and share their ideas and thoughts, and proud to talk. We had a recent example. I was out in our local community, and I heard a woman from a local school speaking about raising culturally conscious kids. I actually hadn't thought about that concept before. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing her speak and afterward said, ""Hey, would you mind stopping by my office and speaking to anyone in the office who has kids that I think would also enjoy your talk?"" And she said, ""Absolutely."" So we had Kiki come in. She spoke to our Fool parents. It was a chance to take a break from your normal day, think about something that normally you don't have mind space for, and just open up and learn. So we have a number of different speakers in. I'm going to say we have a speaker in at least every couple or few weeks. Again, it could be an author. It could be a business leader. It could be someone that you see in the community. Burbage: LeeB@fool.com. Gardner: LeeB@fool.com. We want to hear from you, and when you're coming through the Washington, D.C., area, if you'd like to come by and speak to our employees, we would treasure that. However, back to my small business. My team of 10 people. Maybe I can't get Elon Musk to come this fall, but it turns out I can get somebody that I met through school as a parent. Or somebody through a professional association that you can come in and have your people learn from. And if you do have a larger company, it doesn't have to be everybody. Maybe somebody like Elon Musk can fill the house. But I like the recent evolution, Lee, which is it feels like we have more speakers with smaller groups, with more diverse possibilities as a consequence. Burbage: Yes, and I think that actually feeds the program. You're going from someone like Elon Musk, who's incredible, but then also someone from your local community talking about a completely different topic. Just allowing your mind to stretch in those different ways is fun and exciting, and to your point exactly, Kiki just lives up the street, right, so it was great to have her in. I know I appreciated it, and so did other Fool parents. I think also what you're identifying is there are different groups and types of people in any company, and so the idea that you're going to bring in one speaker every time that's going to appeal to every person at your company is probably unrealistic. So I think what we find is anybody that you can bring in that 10 or more people are interested in, hey, you've hit a pocket of people -- in my case, Fool parents, people with small children -- who are thinking about ""Hey, how do I get out to these?"" Kara probably didn't come to that talk and was like, ""Hey, I'm not that interested."" But she probably came to the talk on keepers. We had a speaker come in about -- was it a Netflix series? Chambers: A documentary ... Burbage: ... that was super popular. Gardner: Ah, yes. Burbage: I didn't go to that one because that's not particularly interesting to me. I don't consider either one of those a failure. Gardner: And before we move to Point No. 3, have other businesses, maybe local, started to play the same game with us? Inviting either of you to come speak? Do you go out and speak, sometimes, to others? Burbage: Yes, I've been asked several times to come in and talk either to associations, groups, that sort of thing, or to local companies. I was speaking to MITRE, a consulting company here in D.C., on a panel that they had. It's a funny thing. When they asked me, I was like, ""Absolutely,"" because it makes you feel good. You're proud to go out and talk about yourself and the cool things we're doing. So people say yes. Gardner: Kara, I know that Lee really likes to speak. I don't know if either one of us likes to speak as much as Lee does. Do you like to speak? Chambers: It's not my favorite, but I keep trying. Burbage: She's super good at it. Chambers: No. I would say also just paying visits. A couple of years ago, one of my colleagues and I went to San Francisco to a conference, and then we had a day free, so we asked our colleagues for some networking. Zooming around. Visited a couple of companies and met with our counterparts there. Gardner: Great idea. Chambers: So it doesn't have to be a presentation. It can just be, ""Hey, can I talk to you about what you do here, and meet your counterpart?"" It's just, again, broadening the network. It doesn't necessarily have to be a talk. That's one way we connect as well. Gardner: Connecting. So Point No. 1 is reading. Point No. 2 is connecting. Kara, what's Point No. 3? Chambers: I have this as ""listening."" This is a project Lee and I work a lot on. We love our peer-coaching program. I put this in as listening because I read somewhere that one of the best gifts you can give somebody that's free is to just give them your undivided attention. What we do is have a peer-coaching program. You can pick and choose. There are different levels of leadership. Different departments. It's not as heavy-handed as a mentorship. It's kind of lightweight. It's maybe one or two meetings a year. They're the person who's delivering your 360 feedback. They're checking with you at least twice a year to talk about just how you are doing. Are you happy? Are you feeling good? What can we do to support you better? It just gives you another outlet with a slightly different agenda than your manager might have, or HR might have. I like doing a lot of coaching. I actually enjoy it. So I think for us, one aspect of well-being is just having someone to listen to you, and that's free. We've worked on it just to build out the logistics, but we find that valuable source internally. Gardner: Kara, you led with the phrase ""peer coach,"" and then you mentioned ""feedback."" Is that the way feedback happens at this company? Chambers: Yes. In a typical company when you would get your 360 feedback, it would get emailed to your manager, and they would have to deliver it to you. Gardner: So that's not The Motley Fool. This is Acme, Inc. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Acme, Inc. has your manager giving you the feedback. Chambers: Yes. That's typical, and as a manager, you want to know what's going on with your employee. But we turned it around, and it took away the pressure. There's zero consequences to someone giving you constructive feedback, because no one else is going to see it but you and your coach, and you just talk about it. And it's mine, so if it comes to me as feedback, I figure out what to do with it with the help of my coach. It doesn't get passed along. It's not part of my record. It doesn't affect my compensation. That frees up my colleagues, who are my friends, who don't want to negatively impact my career, to give constructive feedback with zero consequence. What we found is that creates a much more open environment for that conversation. Gardner: I hope this is fair. I'm going to eavesdrop, briefly, with your help, on The Motley Fool's feedback system. We're conducting that this month at the Fool. I'm going to ask you a couple of things about it really quickly. First of all, does everybody get feedback? Chambers: You can opt in. Everything we do here is optional, so you can choose. Gardner: So you decide if you want feedback. And I have to admit. I'm a little bit of a slacker, because it's August and I'm doing enough, so I didn't request it this time. Chambers: That's OK. Gardner: And that's OK, too. So feedback is not compulsory. It is earned by being asked for. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: That's odd. I think that's cool, though. Chambers: Again, if you are driving your own career, and you want to develop, you're the best person to know where you want to develop and how to figure that out. We also leave it open all year, so you can choose any time. It's kind of confusing, but there's a deadline because one of my colleagues calls it ""social permission"" to ask everybody at the company, or ask a bunch of people to fill something out about you, because it's work. It's still work. But we try to make it easy. We keep the questions really simple. Gardner: And that's where I want to keep eavesdropping, because when I used the form and typed in some feedback for one of my peers, there were just three questions. Chambers: Yes. Gardner: Do you remember what they are right off the top? Because again, I'm listening to this podcast this week maybe because I am in business or an organization. I'm curious what you ask. Burbage: We do keep it simple, and we also keep it positive. So what we found is we want a situation that you're going to look forward to. Related to the manager, people don't normally look forward to a meeting with their boss where they're going to hear a bunch of negative things. Gardner: ""It's time for your annual review, Lee! Have a seat, please!"" Burbage: That sounds horrible, and there's been plenty of study in this area. So instead, you're having this meeting with this third-party sounding-board coach. Our questions change a little bit over time, but they tend to be around where are you awesome, and where can you be even more awesome. We're looking for places to double down, or where you're doing a really good job. And then we've added in a feature where you can ask for feedback in a specific area, so maybe you just completed a project, or there's a particular zone, listening or something that you think you're bad at. Gardner: Lee wants to know what you thought of his lemon meringue pie this month. And his new Lemon Meringue Pie Club. Burbage: Yes. So you may want something specific, and, again, we try to keep it positive. We're building systems here, I think, for all of these that we want people to want to use. Like the worst part of an HR job is running around trying to make people do things. We want to build programs that people are like, ""Oh, I can't wait for feedback to start. I'm looking forward to that, and I'm choosing to opt in."" As opposed to Kara and I having to run around telling you you have to do this thing that you don't want to. Gardner: So it sounds to me as if part of the culture is you've subverted yourself to the employee who is your customer, and you're trying to engage and please that person. Without compelling them or forcing them, you're working extra hard to figure out what they're going to like and want to use. But let me flip this back at you before we move to Point No. 4, because I can imagine some people are listening right now saying, ""You know what? There's a person on my team or at our company. They are not doing a good job, and it's very hard for me to be positive about them."" How do you be effective and negative or, I would say, corrective within such a -- to be unfair to you both -- happy-go-lucky, free love, lemon meringue pie environment? Burbage: I think it's actually a fairly straightforward answer, which is I think if you're waiting for some program to start, or a system to be kicked in for you to be able to give that person that negative feedback, you've probably waited too long, and it's probably not appropriate. I think, David, if you're having some problems with my performance ... Gardner: I'm a little uncomfortable with my performance, Lee. That's about me. Burbage: I'm uncomfortable here on the podcast. Gardner: I've picked some bad stocks in the last year. Burbage: Those are the situations where you shouldn't be relying on a program or system like this. You should be pulling that person aside and talk to them, giving them that kind of feedback. A system like this, or any feedback system, isn't designed to handle that super-heavy load. Chambers: It's about development. And we have one other thing we liked. It's another learning we've had, and that's in terms of language. We offer the option to say, ""I would like your advice on this."" We've heard this. Someone else had this concept. But instead of saying, ""I would like your feedback,"" saying, ""I would like your advice."" That's your takeaway tip. It's just easier. People will always want to give you advice. They don't want to give you feedback. They don't give you a grade. But they're like, ""Oh, you want my advice? OK."" And people will open right up. Gardner: Wow! Chambers: That's a thing that we learned recently this year. So we've added that in this round to see how that goes. Gardner: That's a great point. So that was No. 3, listening. Lee, No. 4. For instance, over the last few weeks Kara and I have been super-involved with a volunteer team of Fools that are investigating a potential new business line for our company, and we just need to do a little research work, so the call was put out. ""Hey, anybody interested in helping out?"" Maybe six Fools raised their hand and said they'd love to help out. So they're dedicating a few hours a week that they have free toward this new venture. And what happens over time is we're actually learning as a business if they're good in that area. And they're learning, as an individual, if that might be an area that they'd like to do even more. Sometimes people walk away and they'll be like, ""Ooh, boy. That was awful. I don't want to do that again."" Or we, as a business, might say, ""Ooh, you're actually not very good at that."" Or even better, we're like, ""Hey, you're great! You should do more of that,"" and it builds into more career development. So just getting people to use their extra bandwidth to get out and about the business and reach beyond what their normal day-to-day work may be. Gardner: I'm curious, Lee. You started that by saying we're a project culture. What does that mean, exactly? Burbage: I don't believe that we have a traditional hierarchy here. A traditional career ladder. People work here for many years and do lots of different things. Our favorite people are ones that are working on maybe six or seven different projects at one time. They may be diverse projects. Some may be leading. Some might be followers. Some might be just playing all kinds of different roles on a team. So you're getting your enjoyment here by working with people that you love on really challenging things that are driving toward our purpose, and that's how you're managing your career. It's moving from project to project, trying new things, getting involved in things that you're passionate about. Gardner: So it really is pretty subversive if you're thinking about a traditional org chart, and a title on your business card, and once I'm junior this, my next goal would be senior this, and I'll get that in three years. And there is a downside to not being that way, because sometimes we'll lose people here at the Fool who want that career path or a clearer sense of what's next, and sometimes they leave the Fool after a few years to go back to maybe a more traditional workplace where they can find that. So what we're describing here -- I don't know how idiosyncratic or not it is -- it's definitely how we roll, and we bet we're probably not the only organization that rolls that way. Burbage: Yes. I mean, I was not the first to say this. Gardner: The Greeks were. I don't even know what you're about to say, but it's very obvious, I think, that Socrates said this. Go ahead! Burbage: Socrates once said every company has a culture, but not every culture is right for everyone. So we have a pretty defined and unique culture that fits and is cool for a lot of people, but not for everybody. We're not a great resume builder or LinkedIn profile-builder company, although when people leave here, they do find some pretty great jobs, but it's nontraditional, sure. Gardner: OK, we're at halftime. Thank you for those first four points. You have four glowing points to come. And right after this brief ad break, I'm going to ask you to think about something in the last 12 months, since you last came on this podcast, that hasn't worked so well. It's natural for us to want to share out the things that have worked well, and I think best-practice sharing is much more valuable, but I know, I'm sure some of our listeners are curious about something that, you know, we're trying stuff all the time. What have we learned that we needed to tweak, or hasn't worked so well? So think about that. All right, Lee and Kara. I asked, before we go on to point No. 5, what's something that hasn't worked? Burbage: So one thing that's pretty easy to do is look at your budget and sort of circle those big items. It's probably healthy, right, to circle those in question, and one thing we did last year was to circle our holiday party and say, ""Wow, that's sort of an expensive event to take everyone and a guest."" And it's hard to get a venue during the holidays. Gardner: That's part of what makes it expensive, right, Lee? Because everybody else is trying to rent the same venues for the holidays, and so the rents go up. Burbage: Absolutely. And you know us. We like to do things different, better, special. And so we're like, ""Ha, ha, ha, we'll get them. We're going to do ours in April. We'll just combine it with some other events. And we won't do the plus one."" And so, essentially, we canceled our holiday party. And as it turns out people missed it. That wasn't such a great decision. And when we announced this year that we were bringing it back, we got a lot of notes and a lot of people that were super-excited. So it turns out I think the money is worth it. To bring people together. To bring their spouse. We sometimes only see that person once a year. To break a little bread and celebrate the year, the timing, the spirit. It works, and I think we made a mistake by canceling our holiday party, and I'm pretty stoked out about it. Gardner: And I was one of those people who wrote a note to you both thanking you. I thought I might be the only one who had written that note. Well, that's a good learning. Kara? Chambers: As we just talked about learning, one thing we're working on is we realized over the years that learning and development in an office has a temptation to bring everyone in and teach a class in a classroom. What you find is sometimes you have to bribe them with sandwiches, and maybe that's not in your budget, either, so you bring them in and you find your attendance starts dropping. So we said nothing is mandatory here. And we're noticing this kind of drop-off, and this is over years. Gardner: Because we have internal classes here at The Motley Fool. Now this is maybe not a normal thing for a lot of people. Kara, what would be a typical class that we might have taught over the years here at the Fool? Chambers: It could be an introduction to how a different department does their work. It could be leadership development for team leaders. The how-to. Gardner: How to fill out your 401(k), I can imagine. These kinds of things. Chambers: Yes, and again, those individually went well, and I'm only thinking of the good ones now. The memorable ones. I'm sure there were ones that were not memorable. But we found that their attendance was dwindling, and so we are spending our time thinking about how to create experiential learning. And you have to walk a line, because if you've got your best people working on your most valuable things, you have a hesitancy to take them off those valuable things to learn. So that constant push-pull is getting your best people and developing them even further, but it's a challenge. If you want something done, ask busy people. So just thinking about your really busy people and then you're like, ""Hey, can you teach this class? Can you do it?"" And what you find is it's hard to get that group. So we're trying to find ways. Maybe it's job swapping. We did a workshop with you not long ago on a project that was kind of fun. We're trying to think of other ways to bring people together to learn things without it being classroom-focused. Because, as we saw, the attendance was dropping, until at one point I remember seeing, ""This meeting is at noon and we don't get any food?"" OK, that's not why we're here. Gardner: Something can be fixed here. Chambers: That's not why we're here. That's something I learned. Gardner: Thank you both. Let's get back on our program, Point Nos. 5 to 8. Let's speed it up a little bit. I think my tendency to just enjoy this conversation too much has me asking too many questions. For our last four we're going to focus it a little bit more, and No. 5, Kara, I think I'm back to you. Chambers: I wouldn't be anywhere if I wasn't talking about an app you need to use. For those of you who are Slack users -- Slack is our internal instant-messaging program -- we use an app in there called Donut, and what that does is, it's an algorithm that pairs you with a random Fool for coffee every other Monday. It's optional. You can opt in. And you can drop out of the Slack channel if you don't want to have coffee the next Monday. They're using some kind of magic algorithm with people outside of your group. What I like about it is -- I'm an introvert. Parties or big happy hours I'll be shy at, but one on one I like talking to people. So once we installed it, I went around and I recruited all of my introverts, one by one, and said, ""Come on. It's so much easier to get to know people one on one with this."" Gardner: It's Donut! Donut! Chambers: Come on! Come on! So we have fun. It's really a nice, low-pressure way to build connections at the Fool. I've been in the position of giving and getting feedback of building your network, and for your more introverted people that can be difficult. So one at a time. At random. Chambers: Donut.ar. Gardner: And if you're not a Slack user, darn it, you probably can use pencil and paper and make a program like this, and pair random people who want to talk some. Burbage: Maybe dice. Chambers: Roll dice. Gardner: No, don't get me started. The gamer in me wants to talk about games. We're going to go back to Point No 6. Lee. So David, if you wanted to move your desk, which is just a table on wheels with two cords, you unplug your cords and you roll your desk over to wherever you want to go. You don't need to ask permission. You don't need to trade desks with somebody. There's no packing, or boxes, or anything. Literally just roll around. Our office is literally different every day, and it's because people are moving around and maybe like Kara, they need a few minutes to work by themselves, because they're more introverted, and they roll their desk over. Like, ""Hey, I'm on a team now. Let me roll that over to my team."" So just providing people that mobility and the autonomy to make their own decision about where and how they want to work has been a big thing for us, and I think people are happier and more productive. Gardner: We didn't force-rank these points, so we're not saying that Point No. 6 is the sixth most important thing. But for a lot of offices -- whether you are in a small or a large office -- that's very doable. Now, for some offices, maybe you have mahogany furniture or you have stuff built in. You have cubicles that are basically anchored to the wall. Maybe you can't do that. But at least your chair on wheels, at least being able to slide around and meet with people or hang out for four days in a workpod to get stuff done seems doable. It wasn't until year what of our company, Lee, that we finally figured out we could put stuff on wheels? Burbage: I think it was about eight years ago. Gardner: So year 16. It took us 16 years to figure that out. Burbage: When you were asking before about major mistakes that we made. I will say that when Bryan Tighe and Chad Wolfsheimer, two Fools that work here, came to me and talked to me about this, my first reaction was, ""That sounds crazy! No, no, no!"" And so it took them a little convincing of me. It's really part of the Scrum and Agile push. In your mahogany desk scenario, I would say we've also found a lot of success finding little spaces in hallways. Any little gap in the office where you can shove a couch or roll a few chairs into to just give people options of other places to sit and interact has been pretty powerful, too. So not being tethered to a mahogany desk in the corner, and instead being able to get out and move around and move about the cabin, we think, is a pretty big deal. Again, my idea from the beginning. Gardner: Kara, Point No. 7. Chambers: Caring. I do our engagement surveys, and for at least nine years a very popular engagement survey question is, ""My team leader, or someone at work, cares about me as a person."" And I enjoy, every time I open up the survey, and it goes up one more point. We're at 95%. That's a humble brag there, but I think it's important. It's part of our culture. A very family-oriented culture. And all the things we do, we want to help you feel like this is part of your family. People you see every day you spend a lot of time with, and so caring about each other is a part of your well-being, just knowing that people do. It's a high driver. It's something that we take pride in that's always been part of our culture. Even when other engagement scores go up and down, I see this go up and I say that makes a resilient culture. That tells me that we are all in it because we care about each other, and I would be a sad person if I had to get up in front of a company and present a score like 50. Gardner: And actually implicit in Point No. 7 -- caring, Kara -- is that we're measuring. And we're not really talking about that this time. I think we've talked about that in a prior podcast. By the way, I'm going to plug your two previous appearances at the end, shortly, so people can find more of such ideas. Chambers: Yeah, and what we say is every company is a great place to work in its own way, and for us that's a big one, and if you have that at your company, just building on it, right? It comes from starting with your founders and hiring your friends, but building from there. Starting with people who care about each other. Gardner: And to be maybe just a little bit soupy and sentimental, Kara and Lee, you're some of my good friends here at the Fool, and I didn't know you when we started The Motley Fool. So one of the things that happens, if you're in a good office, and you stay around for a while, and you've got a positive culture, regardless of what business you're in, is that some of your best friends end up being the people that you're working with every day and you didn't even know them when you graduated high school or college. Point No. 8, Lee. Burbage: So No. 8 builds a little bit on my holiday-party point. Just not forgetting the fun and building into the fun. It can be so easy and, again, to use your word, sappy. We're like, ""Hey, we should have another activity, or another fun event!"" So we do still try to have at least some sort of fun company event that's organized once a month. And the one I wanted to highlight was one that we had from last month, because I'm particularly excited. We tried to think about how could we do something fun that also draws in our remote workforce. So we have a decent number of Fools that are working from around the United States and around the world. All different sorts of time zones. And that can make having a fun event difficult to pull off and maybe even makes them sad. So here we're doing something fun at the headquarters, and we've got someone in Singapore who's saddened because they can't participate. So here's what we did -- a push-up challenge. We've come full circle to being the most athletic company here ... Gardner: Yeah. How could we not mention that in Washington, D.C., we are the reigning, most athletic company in the capital of maybe arguably the most powerful nation the world has ever known? Burbage: I think our hope is they never give that award again, and then we're only the only one ever. But we did a push-up challenge, and it was very simple. You can do this in your company. We had a Google doc where you go and put your name in. I know that you both participated. And just on a daily basis you marked down how many push-ups you're doing and you have a goal. And there's actually some banter talking inside the Google doc, and we had some prizes. Gardner: And some teams challenged some other teams with that. Burbage: Absolutely. So if you're in Singapore, you're in Australia, or you're here in Washington, D.C., you can get in that Google doc. You can participate. It happened all month long. We had a super-fun time. We did, I think, 150,000 push-ups as a company. So we found a way for us to have fun as a company, which I think is easy to forget, especially in the busy world that we live in today. So adding some fun into your company and finding ways for everybody to participate is something I'm particularly excited about. Gardner: OK, we're going to close this one up. I want to give a little bit of a plug to one or two resources that people who have enjoyed this podcast can access, but before I do that I want to ask you each one final question, and Kara, randomly I'll pick you for the first one and Lee, you for the second. Each of these comes from a different type of a listener. We're going to call them ""opposite listeners."" Kara, you're going to speak briefly to the person who has no budget. They're either at a smaller company than The Motley Fool -- and there are many smaller companies than The Motley Fool -- or they're a larger company but there's just no budget for things like wellness or fun. So I'm listening to you guys. You're talking about something that sounds great. I mean, I wish I had that kind of pie in the sky, but I don't. What can I learn from this podcast? What can I do? Chambers: Push-ups and Google docs. They're free, so I'll start with that. Talking about mistakes. Before we had a wellness person, we designed our own wellness challenge, and it was really ridiculously complicated, but we did it. Gardner: It's helpful to have senior people who understand what they're doing. Chambers: It's better in the hands of a professional. That's all I'll say. But nobody got hurt. So try. Loaning books among each other is free. Sitting down and listening to your colleagues -- I'd say the No. 1 takeaway, too, is if you're just starting out in a business, it's really easy to think of now I'm in management and I have to be the police for my employees. And for us it's always, come from a place of trust -- a place of positivity -- and it works. That's why I like to go out into the world and say you can have that with three people, and ideally I hope you do. Gardner: So, so much of what we just covered in these 45 minutes or so is free. It's just about making decisions, having frameworks, and having some internal commitment, or willingness to get there. Willingness to experiment. All right, Lee, you're going to come at this from the other angle. ""Hey, The Motley Fool is a cute company. I appreciate the podcast. I've followed some of your stock picks. You guys are just 300 employees. I work at a division that itself is 3,000 employees. We have tons of resources."" So, Fools listening to this hour, I'm wondering if you had twice the budget that you have, because this hypothetical person that you're going to be, for a sec, Lee, does. This person has twice the budget that we have for employees to focus on wholeness and well-being. If you had more, how would you be spending it? Burbage: I reject the question. The reason I say that is I don't think it's about money. I think what I would love in that scenario, if it were me, is I would have scale to do things that Kara and I can't do because we just don't have enough people. For instance, our coaching program, I think, would be even richer, because I would be leveraging all those people that exist at that company. So whether it's the coaching program or speakers, I don't necessarily need to go external to find speakers. I bet you with a large population inside my company, there are some pretty interesting people that could teach a class. Speak about something that they're doing. So just being able to leverage the human power of all the interesting folks in that scenario would be cool. The second thing I would say is killing systems or processes that are unpopular and not very powerful at scale is a big deal. Gardner: Very powerful. Burbage: Yes. To kill the performance appraisal at 300 was a big deal. To kill the performance appraisal at 3,000 or 6,000 -- they'll write a book about you. Gardner: Well, Kara Chambers and Lee Burbage, two world-class thinkers, and I'm going to say that again with my entrepreneurial pride on my sleeve because of The Motley Fool's renown as a place to work and a place that's constantly experimenting, sometimes with small budgets. I love Lee's point that it's not about money. That's what Kara said as well. So much of this is free. But willing to experiment and try and see what works, and try to make the workplace better for one of our key stakeholders that every organization -- for-profit and not-for-profit -- has, and that's your employees or, if you will, your human capital. I mentioned earlier that I've done two previous podcasts with Kara and Lee, and if you'd like to hear either one of them, I'm going to call them out right now. The very first one was their appearance on Dec. 2, 2015: ""10 Traits of a Great Company Culture."" So if you're on iTunes, you can just scroll down to 12/02/15. Listen to it yourself. Share it with your manager or the big boss at your organization -- whoever it is -- share it out! And then they came back in 2016. The day was May 11. And we imaginatively named that one ""10 More Traits of a Great Company Culture."" Not quite sure what we're going to call this one, because I don't make that call each week. More talented people here at the Fool name these, but maybe we'll have ""10 Even More Great Traits,"" or maybe we'll be more focused on wellness, which was the purpose of this podcast. Kara and Lee, sharing with you what they've learned about the overall well-being of your employees. Now Lee, if you're comfortable, let's say I've really enjoyed this podcast, or one of these, and I want to get in touch with this team at the Fool. How do I reach you? Burbage: I'm happy for people to email me. LeeB@fool.com. It's pretty fun, because it's ""Lee B A Fool."" Gardner: LeeB -- letter B ... Burbage: @fool.com. Gardner: Lee B A Fool. I get it. OK. LeeB@fool.com. And Kara, The Motley Fool has a culture blog. Chambers: Yes. It's culture.fool.com, and all of our content, our job postings, anything we do here. How to get in touch with us. Gardner: We take pictures of ourselves on Halloween or silly, ridiculous stuff. Chambers: You would think all we did was dress up in costumes. Gardner: One would sometimes think. I do follow and I can follow it, by the way, on Twitter at Motley Fool Culture. Burbage: Instagram. Gardner: OK, good. So I do see some of those pictures. Chambers: Yes. Instagram. Motley Fool Culture. I'm TMFKara on Twitter, so I post a lot of stuff I read on there. Gardner: Awesome! Thank you both so much for your time! Thank you, Rule Breaker, whoever and wherever you are. And it's our hope, on behalf of Kara, Lee, and myself, that you find ways to make the place around you, where you go to work every day, better for you and those around you in the year ahead. Fool on!

    8 Ways The Motley Fool Does Workplace Well-Being Right -- The Motley Fool

  ",1.0
209,"Brian Stoffel, Matthew Frankel, CFP, and Rich Duprey",10052017,Fool,9282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Where will you be in 2091? It's safe for most of us to assume we won't be around. So here's a better question: What companies that exist today will still be around in 2091? Image source: Getty Images. Here, three of our investors here at The Motley Fool will tell you why they think Welltower (NYSE:WELL), Boeing (NYSE:BA), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are all worth buying and holding for the next 75 years. Matt Frankel (Welltower): Welltower is the largest real estate investment trust, or REIT, that specializes in healthcare properties. This could be an excellent way to invest in the aging U.S. population, while generating a rock-solid income stream at the same time. The company owns 1,384 healthcare properties, about 70% of which are senior housing facilities. Most of the properties are located in the United States, but the company has substantial investments in the U.K. and Canada as well. To make a long story short, because of the ongoing retirement of the baby boomer generation and longer life expectancies, the older age groups of the population are expected to grow rapidly in all three of Welltower's markets. The senior citizen population (ages 65 and up) is expected to roughly double between now and 2050, and the 85-and-above age group -- the group most likely to utilize senior housing -- is expected to grow significantly faster than that. Welltower has a 46-year track record of delivering strong results and dividend growth to its investors, with a 15.5% average annualized return since inception, and a nearly perfect history of increasing its dividend, which currently translates to a 4.6% yield. While a company's past performance is certainly not a guarantee of its future returns, with the favorable demographic trends, there's no reason to believe Welltower won't continue to outperform. Rich Duprey (Boeing): Aerospace and defense contracting giant Boeing  is going to be around for a long, long time to come. While it is a cyclical business and it's been flying high since the recession, Boeing could still have plenty of altitude left in its stock, particularly over the next 75 years. Arguably best known for its hugely popular 737, as well as the 747, a plane Boeing first introduced in 1970, the 787 Dreamliner widebody has garnered much of the attention because of its audaciousness -- though it ultimately serves a limited market. But there's also a new 400-seat aircraft -- the 777X -- that's still on the drawing board, and it could become the biggest-selling airplane in the market after its first delivery in 2020. Currently the sweet spot for aircraft manufacturing remains the 737, where Boeing has a backlog of over 4,500 plane orders. Even as it builds them at a rate of 42 per month, it expects to incrementally increase that number to 57 per month by the end of the decade. As important as the commercial-aircraft market is, let's not forget the defense-contracting side of the ledger, where Boeing continues to add new contracts for military aircraft, both here and abroad. From fighter jets to maritime observation craft, Boeing goes hand in hand with the country's military budget, which, particularly these days, may see significant increases. That's not likely to change of the coming decades, and where companies such as Lockheed Martin  will be both competitor and partner at times, and upstarts such as SpaceX will also enter the picture, investors can rest assured that Boeing will remain a constant. With a dividend that's currently yielding 2.2% because of its price, 75 years from now, Boeing stock will be looking back at us from the stratosphere. While Amazon hasn't been around as long as a lot of other companies out there, there's something that gives me confidence about its survival: It focuses on the things that don't change. Here's what CEO Jeff Bezos has to say: We know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ""Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,"" [or] ""I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly."" The basis for that viewpoint comes from the company's simple mission statement: ""to be the earth's most customer-centric company."" I believe customer service will always be in demand. As long as Amazon can keep this point front and center, I believe it will thrive for decades. ","

210,,10052017,MarketWatch,9282017,"Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: The horror in Las Vegas may not dramatically change the debate about guns. But the response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which has left at least 59 dead and hundreds more wounded, reveals a great deal about our politics. Here are 10 takeaways: 1. No new gun laws will pass. The National Rifle Association deserves more credit than any other outside group for Donald Trump’s victory, and the president knows it. “You came through big for me, and I am going to come through for you,” he said at the NRA’s April convention in Atlanta. Virtually no Republican in Congress, and certainly no one in leadership, is willing to cross the powerful gun lobby. Even if Trump decided he wanted to act, which he will not, his party would block him. 2. But Vegas makes it much harder for Republicans to roll back existing gun laws. In the wake of the attack, House Republican leaders have decided to table a bill that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. At least for now. “That bill, introduced by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), has been approved by the Natural Resources Committee and was expected to be on the House floor soon, though it had not yet been scheduled for a vote,” Politico reports. “Consideration of the bill was (already) postponed earlier this year after Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot in June at a congressional baseball practice.” “Rep. Richard Hudson's (R-N.C.) proposal to allow concealed-carry permit holders to take their guns with them across state lines also faces new political problems,” per John Bresnahan, Heather Caygle and Burgess Everett. “The Duncan legislation includes a provision revising federal regulations on silencers, which currently have tougher purchasing requirements than other guns. A different provision in the Duncan bill makes it more difficult for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to classify certain ammunition as ‘armor piercing.’ Regulations on interstate transportation weapons would be revised as well.” 3. There will be at least some new converts for gun control. After spending the night fearing for his life, the lead guitarist for the Josh Abbot Band — a Texas-based country group — announced that he has changed his position. “I’ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,” Caleb Keeter wrote in a statement. “They were useless. … We need gun control RIGHT. NOW.” 4. Gun control will be a litmus test for Democrats in 2020. It is inconceivable that Democrats will nominate someone for president who is not an outspoken proponent of tough new gun laws. Bernie Sanders was on the defensive throughout the 2016 Democratic primaries over his moderate record on guns, which reflects the culture of his home state of Vermont. Hillary Clinton successfully used this as a wedge issue to squeeze him from the left. Many presidential aspirants, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), quickly moved past the normal niceties after a tragedy and were agitating for tough laws within hours of Vegas. They know nothing will pass, but they are laying a marker. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who represents Newtown, has become the most forceful advocate for action in the 2020 field. “It's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something,” he said. (Read Murphy’s op-ed in today’s Post.) Many rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers are beginning to boycott “the predictable moments of unification that commonly occur in the hours after mass shootings — hoping their refusal to participate will call attention to the inaction,” the Boston Globe’s Annie Linskey reports. “To have only a moment of silence where there never is action taken, tragedy after tragedy, that is not something I want to be a part of,” said Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), who led the sit-in on the House floor after the shooting in Orlando. 5. The Vegas attack has pushed gun control to the front burner of the neck-and-neck race for Virginia governor. “At a previously scheduled forum in Vienna … Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie offered condolences. But the partisan divide over guns in Virginia, a Southern state with a strong gun tradition that was shaken by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, was immediately evident,” Fenit Nirappil reports. “Northam, a former Army doctor who has an F rating from the National Rifle Association, decried what he called ‘a proliferation of guns’ in society and urged gun-control measures. Gillespie, who has an A rating and an endorsement from the NRA, asked for a moment of silence, later telling reporters that it was too soon to discuss policy. … Gillespie is opposed to further restrictions on guns and promised to reverse an executive order signed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) that bans guns in state government buildings.” The debate about guns could help Gillespie bring home Trump supporters who backed his rival, Corey Stewart, in the June Republican primary. Conservatives who may not like the former RNC chairman will vote for him if they believe Northam wants to restrict their rights. The back-and-forth might also nationalize the race, which works against Gillespie in an environment where Trump remains unpopular. -- Sneak peek: Speaking of the Trump dynamic, Northam will unveil a new ad today that touts his willingness to stand up to the president. “As a doctor, nobody ever asks if I’m a Democrat or a Republican. They just want my help,” the lieutenant governor says to camera. “So if Donald Trump is helping Virginia, I’ll work with him. But Donald Trump proposed cutting Virginia’s school funding, rolling back our clean air and water protections, and taking away healthcare from thousands of Virginians. … I’ve stood up to Donald Trump on all of it. Ed Gillespie refuses to stand up to him at all.” 6. The paranoid style in American politics is alive and well. Televangelist Pat Robertson suggested yesterday that disrespect for Trump was a factor behind the shooting. “Violence in the streets, ladies and gentlemen,” he said on the Christian Broadcasting Network’s “700 Club.” “Why is it happening? . . . The fact that we have disrespect for authority. There is profound disrespect of our president. All across this nation, they say terrible things about him. It’s in the news. It’s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line: disrespect. … Until there is Biblical authority, there has to be some controlling authority in our society and there is none. … When there is no vision of God, the people run amok. We have taken from the American people the vision of God.” Wayne Allyn Root, a columnist for the Sheldon Adelson-owned Las Vegas Review-Journal who warmed up crowds during Trump rallies in 2016, pushed the theory on Twitter that the shooter must be Muslim. After police announced that he was not, Root refused to back down or apologize. “[G]overnment restrictions will not stop psychopaths from harming people. They will find a way,” former Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly wrote on his blog. “This is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are. The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons.” -- To be sure, there are extreme views on both sides. CBS announced that it fired a company lawyer who wrote on Facebook yesterday that she was “actually not even sympathetic” to the shooting victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” “If they wouldn’t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs will ever do the right thing,” she wrote. 7. The fever swamps of the Internet have powerful megaphones, even when what’s being yelled is false. “Geary Danley was not the gunman … But for hours on the far-right Internet, would-be sleuths scoured Danley’s Facebook likes, family photographs and marital history to try to ‘prove’ that he was,” Abby Ohlheiser reports. “Danley, according to an archived version of a Facebook page bearing that name, might have been married to a Marilou Danley. Police were looking for a woman by that name in the hours after the shooting, but later said they did not think she was involved. The briefest look at the viral threads and tweets falsely naming Geary Danley as the attacker makes it easy to guess why a bunch of right-wing trolls latched on to him: His Facebook profile indicated that he might be a liberal … “That phony story quickly embedded itself into the algorithms of Google and Facebook, where sites promoting the rumor remained at the top of the results for anyone searching for Danley’s name. … For a time on Monday morning, one of those 4chan threads falsely naming Danley as the shooter was promoted by Google as a ‘top story’ for searches for his name … The right-wing news site Gateway Pundit [which the White House has given press credentials to] also picked up these rumors as fact in a now-deleted article. … And on Facebook, a search for articles about Geary Danley promoted seven links leading to inaccurate stories about him. The eighth result is a debunking.” (BuzzFeed debunks 19 other hoaxes that spread online after the shooting.) These are many of the same people that promoted Pizzagate, and the fact that the fake stories got as much visibility and traction as they did suggests that search giants and social media platforms still have a lot of work to do before they can be considered responsible corporate actors. 8. More than ever, in a polarized and fragmented country, comedians are emerging as prominent voices of moral authority. Every late-night TV comedian except Jimmy Fallon opened his show last night with a serious monologue about what transpired in Vegas. Emily Yahr writes up what each of them said: “Trevor Noah and James Corden were in disbelief over American gun culture. Conan O’Brien was devastated to realize how many times he’s had to talk about mass shootings. Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers urged Congress to take action on gun control.” Jimmy Kimmel has clearly been emboldened by the role he played in stopping the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill from passing last week. The ABC host was in tears on his show last night as he spoke about the “terrible, inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy” in his hometown of Las Vegas. Kimmel choked up several times during a 10-minute speech. He called out Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan by name. “They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country, because it’s so crazy,” he said. (Read a full transcript of the monologue here.) Click below to watch: Watch Conan: Watch Noah: Watch Meyers: Watch Corden: 9. The polling on guns is much more complicated and nuanced than most of the mainstream media’s coverage might lead you to believe. “Democrats are fond of pointing out that 8 in 10 or 9 in 10 Americans favor expanded background checks for gun purchases. That's true, but it also masks another important reality: Republicans just don't think legislation is the answer, period,” Aaron Blake writes on The Fix. “In June 2016, Quinnipiac University asked whether people supported a ban on ‘assault weapons’ — a.k.a. semiautomatic ones. About 6 in 10 Americans (59 percent) supported it, including 4 in 10 Republicans (40 percent). But when the pollster asked whether such a ban would be effective in reducing gun violence, Americans actually disagreed by a small margin, 49-47. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought it would be effective, while 70 percent said it wouldn't. “The story was similar on background checks: While 93 percent of all people and 90 percent of Republicans said they supported background checks for all gun purchases, only 62 percent overall and 42 percent of Republicans thought it would actually reduce gun violence. A majority of Republicans (53 percent) again felt it wouldn't help at all. … And if you don't think these address the problem, you're more likely to believe specific proposals overreach into ‘gun grabs.’” “And in fact, multiple polls have shown a large percentage of Americans think the answer is more guns, not fewer. A Washington Post-ABC News poll that same month showed that 54 percent would encourage more people to carry guns legally for self-defense. Just 42 percent discouraged it.” 10. Regardless of the polling, the truth is that America’s deadliest shooting incidents are getting much deadlier. Philip Bump charts how the death toll of these massacres has grown over time: WHAT HAPPENED: -- “Under the neon glow and glitz of the Vegas Strip, thousands of concertgoers who had gathered for a three-day music festival dove for cover or raced toward shelter when the gunfire began at about 10 p.m. Sunday,” Heather Long, Mark Berman and Derek Hawkins report. “Police said more than 22,000 people were at the concert when Paddock began firing round after round, shooting from an elevated position that left those on the ground effectively helpless. The typical advice for reacting to an active shooter — ‘run, hide or fight’ — was rendered moot, as many in the packed crowd could not easily run or hide, nor were they able to fight back at someone firing from so far away.” -- “Outside, The Strip, always a blizzard of dazzling lights and honking horns, almost instantly turned into a frenzied hive of pulsing police lights and sirens,” Michael Lyle, Heather Long and Marc Fisher report. “People fled every which way, many taking cellphone video of their run to safety. [Former minor league baseball player Todd Blyleven, who traveled from Dallas for the concert with his wife and friends], helped carry out the lifeless body of a young woman. He saw a police officer who looked like he had taken a bullet in the neck. ‘Young girls and guys, older folks, just people walking out of a country concert with bullet holes,’ Blyleven said.” -- “Aldean was barely five measures into ‘When She Says Baby,’ when the shots started,” Avi Selk and Amy B Wang report. “’Is that gunfire?’ [Singer Jason] Owen remembered thinking[.] The gunfire continued, steady against the beat of the song … Shot after shot, faster and faster. Aldean sprinted off the stage. Owen ran, too. So did other singers, workers and all the thousands of spectators — fleeing and screaming, falling and dying.” -- A fire alarm triggered by gun smoke let first responders zero in on the shooter’s location. SWAT team members then used explosives to get inside, where they found [Paddock] dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. “We believe the individual killed himself prior to our entry,” the sheriff said. (Cleve R. Wootson Jr.) -- “I realized people were dying"": Photographer David Becker spoke to The Post's photo editor MaryAnne Golon about witnessing the attack and capturing some of the most haunting images from the night: “ It had been so dark outside I couldn’t see the details. I just saw a lot of people laying on the ground thinking they were playing possum, but now I could see people covered in blood and I thought, this is real. When I saw the image of the woman lying on the ground covered in blood, that was when the impact of what I was experiencing hit — when I realized people were dying.” Jessica Klymchuk was among the victims. (Social media/Reuters) THE VICTIMS: -- Only a handful of the 59 victims so far have been identified. They range in age from 20 to nearly 60 and came from across the country for the music festival. They included a single mother of four, a registered nurse and a Las Vegas police officer. The Post will keep updating this running list as more names are released. Sandy Casey, a special-education teacher, had recently gotten engaged. She was attending the concert with her fiance, Christopher Willemse, and friends when she was struck in her lower back. She died in Willemse’s arms as he attempted to carry her to safety. Angie Gomez was just 20 and went to the festival to celebrate her new job as a certified nursing assistant. Her boyfriend of five years and several strangers attempted to get her to a hospital, but she died before receiving medical attention. John Phippen, 57, traveled to Las Vegas from California with his son Travis. As the gunshots first rang out, Phippen jumped on top of his son and saved his life. Travis, who has experience as a medic, went on to treat more than a dozen of the injured, despite taking a bullet to the arm. Jonathan Smith, 30, saved ~30 people last night before he was shot in the neck. He might live w/the bullet for rest of his life. #vegasstrip pic.twitter.com/6hLujXWe51 THE HEROES: -- Jonathan Smith was shot in the neck while helping dozens to safety. Heather Long reports: “Smith was focused on saving his young nieces, but they separated in the crowd. … He grabbed people and told them to follow him toward a handicapped parking area in the direction of the airport, away from Las Vegas Boulevard. It was a large field with several rows of vehicles. Smith and the others crouched down behind one of the last rows of cars. … A few young girls weren’t fully hidden. He stood up and moved toward them to urge them to get on the ground. That’s when a bullet struck him in the neck. … ‘I don’t see myself [as a hero],’ he said. ‘I would want someone to do the same for me. No one deserves to lose a life coming to a country festival.’” “He’s just a guy who lived in Mesquite who liked burritos,” is how Eric Paddock described his brother, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock pic.twitter.com/q3MUgIa2Ws THE SHOOTER: -- Stephen Paddock, 64, was described as a high-stakes gambler who mostly kept to himself at a quiet retirement community outside Las Vegas. Neighbors said he would disappear for “days at a time,” frequenting casinos with his longtime girlfriend, Marilou Danley. William Wan, Sandhya Somashekhar, Aaron C. Davis and Barbara Liston have more: Relatives expressed bewilderment and told authorities they were not aware of any mental illness or substance abuse problems: “Eric Paddock said he knew of five guns his brother kept in his safe but was shocked that a rapid-fire weapon was used in Sunday’s shooting. He said his brother didn’t hunt, barely shot his guns and once took Eric Paddock’s children on a skeet-shooting trip paid for by the casinos.” He liked to wager tens of thousands of dollars in a single sitting: “He owned homes in four states but preferred staying in casino hotels, sometimes for weeks at a time . . . He was worth more than $2 million, relatives said. At various points of his life, Stephen Paddock worked for defense contractor Lockheed Martin and as an accountant and property manager. As a retiree, he had no children and plenty of money to play with. So he took up gambling. ‘It’s like a job for him. It’s a job where you make money,’ said Eric Paddock, adding that his brother could lose $1 million and still have enough to live on.’” For several years, the gunman lived with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, in a retirement community in Reno: “[Neighbors] said they interacted with Danley but not with Paddock, whom they described as extremely standoffish. . . . Harold Allred, who lives up the street from the couple, said his wife often ran into Danley in exercise classes or social gatherings. Allred said he and his wife found Danley unremarkable, though perhaps a little odd, and didn’t know Paddock. ‘He was reclusive,’ said Allred, 66. ‘We never met him.’” “Paddock’s father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, described on a 1969 wanted poster as ‘psychopathic’ with suicidal tendencies. He escaped from prison that year and, according to news accounts, was not captured until 1978, when he was nabbed while running a bingo parlor in Oregon.” THE WEAPONS: -- Even after searching his home, investigators are still trying to figure out Paddock’s motive. ""[Authorities] said hotel staff had been in and out of the two-room suite, which Paddock had stayed in since Sept. 28, and spotted nothing ‘nefarious,’ though he had more than 10 suitcases,” Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Mark Berman report. -- Authorities said Paddock had a cache of 23 firearms in his possession. Michael S. Rosenwald, Devlin Barrett and Alex Horton report: “One of the weapons Paddock apparently [used] was an AK-47 type rifle, with a stand to steady it for firing[.] … Investigators believe at least one of the guns functioned as if it were fully automatic and are now working to determine whether he modified it or others to be capable of spitting out a high volume of fire just by holding down the trigger[.] But video from the attack suggests Paddock may have used at least one fully automatic rifle, marking the first time such a weapon has been wielded by a public mass shooter in the United States.” THE TRUMP RESPONSE: -- The White House repeatedly insisted yesterday that it was not appropriate to talk about policy on the day of a tragedy. “There will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that’s not the place that we’re in at this moment,”  said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. -- But Trump selectively politicizes events, whenever they work to his advantage. “Time and time again, he has capitalized on terror to advance his agenda,” write Michael Scherer and Philip Rucker. “After a bomb attack on a train in London in September, Trump called for a ‘far larger, tougher and more specific’ travel ban … well before London authorities had declared that terrorism was the cause. When an indebted gambler assaulted a Manila casino in June, killing dozens by starting a fire, Trump called the event ‘terrorism’ at the White House, even though local police later said the attack was a robbery attempt unconnected to terrorism. During his campaign, Trump made the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. … a centerpiece of his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. And Trump reacted to the shooting at an Orlando nightclub with self-praise, suggesting that the incident was a symptom of weak Democratic policies. “The Las Vegas massacre was different, both because investigators have found no evidence linking the shooter to a terrorist organization and because he was a white American, as opposed to a Muslim immigrant,” Scherer and Rucker write. “The emerging facts prevented Trump from following his typical playbook — to rally his supporters against Islamic extremism while speaking and tweeting in a combative, even belligerent tone to try to project strength and resolve. Rather, Trump uttered just 574 words on Monday and tried to play the role of uniter.” -- “Mass shootings are so frequent in America that the political responses to them have become ritualized to the point of parody,” Ryan Lizza writes in the New Yorker. “Trump … read haltingly from a teleprompter in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where F.D.R. once calmed Depression- and Second World War-era America with his fireside chats. It was not Trump’s worst public performance. He stayed on script, and read a short and well-crafted statement without making any bizarre Trumpian asides. But it was a classic of the ‘thoughts and prayers’ model in that it offered no promise of a policy response whatsoever. … Near the end of his speech, Trump said that ‘even the most terrible despair can be illuminated by a single ray of hope.’ If your hope was that Washington would start to grapple with a response to the crisis of mass shootings, the President didn’t offer a single ray.” -- David Frum, who was a speechwriter in George W. Bush’s White House, says Trump’s comments were “steeped in hypocrisy”: “He is the least outwardly religious president of modern times, the president least steeped in scripture. For him to offer the consolations of God and faith after mass bloodletting is to invite derision. ‘It is love that defines us,’ said President Trump, and if we weren’t heartbroken, we would laugh. Those who praised the speech, as CNN’s John King did, are reacting on reflex. This is the kind of thing we are used to hearing from Republican politicians; Trump is a Republican politician; therefore this is what he should say… “But whereas Vice President Pence could have pronounced those words with sincerity, or a convincing simulacrum thereof, Donald Trump looked shifty, nervous, and false,” Frum writes in The Atlantic. Speeches are watched as well as heard, and the viewer saw a president who wished he were somewhere else because he had been compelled to pretend something so radically false to his own nature. For once, Trump read the speech exactly as written. Perhaps his aides talked him into it. Because Trump is not a good reader, he read the speech wrong. And because it sounded wrong, he looked bad.” -- POSTPONED: The Daily 202 Live with Mick Mulvaney. My sit-down with the OMB director, which was set for tomorrow, has been postponed.

He went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to a hospital, leading some outlets to erroneously report his death earlier on Monday. Petty’s longtime manager confirmed the sad news last night. Harrison Smith and Adam Bernstein with his obituary: “Mr. Petty and his band, the Heartbreakers, released their self-titled debut in 1976 and soon drew comparisons to the bluesy, guitar-heavy rock of the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Their music was unabashedly sentimental, seeming to speak to striving, everyday Americans no less than the songs of fellow rocker Bruce Springsteen[.] … The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Mr. Petty and the Heartbreakers in 2002. ‘I’d like to see us break some new ground and leave some sort of mark on the music,’ Mr. Petty once said … ‘If you could make some little dent in rock, where that little area is yours — that’s what I’m striving for now.’” -- Americans Rainer Weiss, Barry C.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) GET SMART FAST:​​ Paul Manafort talks to reporters on the floor of the Republican National Convention. (Matt Rourke/AP) THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Trump associates have given investigators documents showing two previously unreported contacts with Russia during the 2016 campaign. Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman and Adam Entous report: “In one case, Trump’s personal attorney and a business associate exchanged emails weeks before the Republican National Convention about traveling to an economic conference in Russia that would be attended by top Russian financial and government leaders, including [Vladimir Putin] … In the other case, the same Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, received a proposal in late 2015 for a Moscow residential project from a company founded by a billionaire who once served in the Russian Senate[.]” -- The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe and Franklin Foer obtained the full emails exchanged between Manafort and an international intermediary to get a message to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, which were first reported by The Post. “[T]he full text of these exchanges … shows that Manafort attempted to leverage his leadership role in the Trump campaign to curry favor with a Russian oligarch close to [Putin]. Manafort was deeply in debt, and did not earn a salary from the Trump campaign. There is no evidence that Deripaska met with Manafort in 2016, or knew about Manafort’s attempts to reach him. Yet the extended correspondence between Manafort and [the intermediary] paints a more complete portrait of Manafort’s willingness to trade on his campaign position.” -- The top legal counsel on Robert Mueller’s team, Michael Dreeben, has reportedly been researching the limits of presidential pardons. Bloomberg’s Greg Farrell reports: “Pre-emptive pardons are a distinct possibility now that current and former Trump advisers are under Mueller’s scrutiny. Trump himself has tweeted that everyone agrees the U.S. president has ‘complete power to pardon.’ … [T]he legal territory is largely uncharted over pardons of a president’s own campaign workers, family members or even himself -- and how prosecutors’ work would then be affected. What Dreeben brings to the question, say those who know him, is a credibility that comes from parsing how criminal prosecutions have played out across the country.” -- Freshman Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kan.) booked a basement room in the Capitol for former congressman Connie Mack (R-Fla.) to hold a sham hearing for his Ukrainian lobbying client. The Daily Beast’s Betsy Woodruff and Andrew Desiderio report: “[T]he fake ‘hearing’ was broadcast in full on Ukraine’s NewsOne and described to viewers as the ‘U.S. Congressional Committee on Financial Issues.’ But not a single member of Congress attended. The network teased the ‘shocking details’ about the ‘highest levels of corruption in the NBU,’ referring to the National Bank of Ukraine. … A pamphlet handed out to attendees was evaluated by a Ukrainian fact-checking website as having ‘mostly correct’ data about the NBU but ‘manipulated in almost all occasions.’” Mack lobbies on behalf of Interconnection Commerce — which was implicated in the Pentagon Papers — as well as Hungary’s Putin-allied political party. -- The Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), said that the CIA denied the committee’s request to review information about Russian meddling that has already been seen by the chamber’s intelligence committee. (Politico) Russian President Vladimir Putin drives a motor boat at the cascade of mountain lakes in Siberia. (European Pressphoto Agency/Nikolsky/Sputnik) MOSCOW IS USING OUR OWN TECH TOOLS  AGAINST US: -- By using Facebook’s powerful “Custom Audience” tool to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda — and then targeting them with messages designed to influence their voting behavior — Russian operatives exploited a system used frequently by U.S. corporations. Elizabeth Dwoskin, Craig Timberg and Adam Entous report: “The Web sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook ‘retargeting’ tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.” -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he hopes to make public a sampling of Russia-linked Facebook ads that were turned over to Congress on Monday “as soon as possible.” “The American people deserve to see the ways that the Russian intelligence services manipulated and took advantage of online platforms to stoke and amplify social and political tensions, which remains a tactic we see the Russian government rely on today,” said Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. -- HP Enterprise allowed a Russian defense agency to scrutinize the cyberdefense system used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks, potentially helping Moscow identify weaknesses in the software. Reuters’s Joel Schectman, Dustin Volz and Jack Stubbs report: “The HPE system, called ArcSight, serves as a cybersecurity nerve center for much of the U.S. military, alerting analysts when it detects that computer systems may have come under attack. ArcSight is also widely used in the private sector. The Russian review of ArcSight’s source code, the closely guarded internal instructions of the software, was part of HPE’s effort to win the certification required to sell the product to Russia’s public sector, according to the regulatory records … Six former U.S. intelligence officials, as well as former ArcSight employees and independent security experts, said the source code review could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping attackers to blind the U.S. military to a cyber attack.” Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner talk before a joint news conference with Donald Trump and the Lebanese prime minister. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) THE TRUMP EMAILS: -- White House officials are looking into a THIRD email account on Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s private domain, which received hundreds of messages from White House addresses. Politico’s Josh Dawsey and Andrea Peterson report: “The emails — which include nonpublic travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials — were in many cases sent from Ivanka Trump, her assistant Bridges Lamar and others who work with the couple in the White House. The emails to the third account were largely sent from White House accounts but occasionally came from other private accounts[.] … The existence of additional accounts on the family domain … raises new questions about the extent of personal email use by the couple during their time as White House aides.” (This may violate the Presidential Records Act.) HURRICANE MARIA FALLOUT: -- Trump will visit Puerto Rico today. Arelis Hernández, Dan Lamothe and Joel Achenbach report on how the island’s situation became desperate: “When things went bad during Hurricane Maria, they went bad all at once, across this entire island. Suddenly, everything was dysfunctional, including the power grid, the cellphone towers, the banking system. … The difficulty in responding to Maria has revealed how unique each disaster is — and how resistant to a one-size-fits-all approach. … For Maria, numerous Coast Guard and FEMA urban-search-and-rescue teams were on hand or arrived quickly. But it soon became clear that what people needed most were life-sustaining provisions — including water, food and diesel fuel for generators — that the search-and-rescue teams didn’t have.” -- During his visit, Trump may see San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, his most recent Twitter target. Abby Phillip reports: “[T]he White House seemed to be downplaying his harsh criticism of Cruz, saying she had been invited to participate in the official visit. ‘Look, right now our focus is to bring the mayor into the coordination efforts,’ said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ‘This administration, as well as other members on the ground, have reached out to her.’ ‘We hope that she will join with us in those efforts and be part of things,’ she added.” -- Meanwhile, the Trump administration is planning to ask Congress for another $10 billion in relief funding. Ed O’Keefe reports: “[O]fficials [in Puerto Rico] and some lawmakers on the mainland are clamoring for legislation that would provide tens of billions of dollars in relief and address Puerto Rico’s long-simmering fiscal crisis, shore up its bankrupt electric company and plug a shortfall in Medicaid funding. … [Carmelo] Ríos, the Puerto Rico Senate’s majority leader, warned that Congress should act quickly. If it doesn’t, he expects 100,000 to 200,000 island residents to relocate, at least temporarily, to the mainland United States in the coming weeks.” -- Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are proposing to combine $1 billion in extra Medicaid funding to Puerto Rico with the renewal of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Paige Winfield Cunningham reports: “[The proposal] would be paid for with a bucket of items, including raising Medicare rates for wealthier seniors, redirecting dollars from the Affordable Care Act’s prevention fund and shortening a grace period for enrollees who don’t pay their premiums. … The funding, which would be provided to Puerto Rico over a two-year period, would be part of a package to fund [CHIP], community health centers and other health-care extenders.” -- School districts along the entire East Coast are preparing to take on an influx of new Puerto Rican students as some families leave the island. The Wall Street Journal’s Joseph De Avila and  Arian Campo-Flores report: “The Miami-Dade County school district has enrolled about a dozen Puerto Rican children. ‘I think that number will grow exponentially,’ said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade Public Schools. … Boston schools, which have a 42% Hispanic population out of about 57,000 students, are setting up one-stop centers with nonprofit groups where families will be able to enroll students, get language assessments and obtain winter clothing[.] … Officials with New York City schools, the largest district in the U.S., with 1.1 million students, have been meeting regularly to prepare for the arrival of Puerto Rican evacuees[.]” This is a GOP tax plan? Possibly 30% of middle class gets a tax hike? I hope the final details are better than this. https://t.co/lcjkI4YRz8 THE AGENDA: -- The fight over the GOP's tax plan begins, with friendly fire from both Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.). Kelsey Snell reports: “Neither Paul nor Corker said he was firmly against the bill, but any GOP split over the tax framework creates a potentially perilous negotiation in the Senate[.] … Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said plans to finance tax cuts by adding to the deficit could be a problem for some Republicans but he is confident that economic growth will more than compensate for short-term losses.” -- Trump is considering an executive order that would trigger a review of the American welfare system. Politico’s Andrew Restuccia reports: “[T]he draft order calls on agencies to review existing regulations and propose new rules that conform to a set of broad welfare principles, including tighter work requirements that encourage recipients to shift back into the labor force … Administration backers of the welfare executive order hope he signs it before Thanksgiving, one of the officials said. But another official cautioned that the conversations about the order are ‘very preliminary at this stage,’ adding that the final outcome is uncertain.” -- Since taking office, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has had numerous meetings with top energy executives and almost none with environmental groups. The New York Times’s Eric Lipton and Lisa Friedman reports: “In just the first 15 days of May, Mr. Pruitt met with the chief executive of the Chemours Company, a leading chemical maker, as well as three chemical lobbying groups; the egg producers lobby; the president of Shell Oil Company; the chief executive of Southern Company; lobbyists for the farm bureau, the toy association and a cement association; the president of a truck equipment manufacturer seeking to roll back emissions regulations for trucks; and the president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. … Mr. Pruitt also has made frequent, government-funded trips to his home state of Oklahoma, even when the journeys included only a bit of official business.” Left: Doug Jones chats with constituents before a Democratic Senate candidate forum. (Jeronimo Nisa /Decatur Daily/AP) Right: Roy Moore during his election party. (Brynn Anderson/AP) OFF TO THE RACES: -- Democrats are debating whether to commit extensive resources to Doug Jones’s Senate race against Roy Moore in Alabama, where they haven't competed in a serious Senate battle since 1996. The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: “Democrats here and in Washington believe that their nominee … is the most formidable candidate they have fielded for the Senate in this state in over two decades. … Some in the party believe that they simply cannot write off the South if they expect to regain control of Congress — and that they will never recover here if they abandon high-quality candidates such as Mr. Jones. But the Democratic brand has become so toxic in states such as Alabama that if the national party rallies behind Mr. Jones and turns his candidacy into a liberal cause célèbre, it could only doom him by pushing Republicans reluctant to support Mr. Moore back to their partisan corner. … “But in the eyes of many Democrats, opposing Mr. Moore is as much a moral imperative as a political one. As [David] Axelrod put it, [Moore], who has a decades-long record of making incendiary comments about gays, African-Americans and Muslims, is so offensive to Democrats that it makes him ‘hard to ignore.’ … [James] Carville added, ‘if you can’t run against Roy Moore, then what kind of party you got?’” -- A group of pro-Trump figures is launching a new super PAC seeking to take aim at the Republican establishment. The Atlantic’s Rosie Gray reports: “Jeff Giesea, Mike Cernovich, and Jack Posobiec, organizers of the ‘Deploraball’ party to celebrate President Trump’s inauguration earlier this year, are behind the super PAC, which is being called #Rev18.""

Flynn. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE: -- “How Mike Flynn Jr. Is Dealing with Being Trapped Inside the Mueller Investigation,” by GQ's Ben Schreckinger: “That the younger Flynn — a man whose résumé is devoid of political experience—would end up on Mueller's radar speaks to a crazy truth in the widening Trump/Russia investigation. For every sophisticated operator like Paul Manafort, who has spent a lifetime in the trenches of political warfare … there's also a guy like Mike Flynn Jr. — a pretty average dude swept into a roiling case of monumental importance. That means that not only do Trump and his team have to worry about the potential misdeeds perpetrated by the president's men, but they must also fret about the president's dudes — and whatever malfeasance these amateurs may have committed out of sheer ignorance. . . . The myriad legal hassles the Flynns now face stem not from nefarious intent, [one] official argued, but from the fact that Flynn Jr. was in charge of the Flynn Intel Group's paperwork and was unqualified for his position. … ‘I wouldn't expect him to know who Farrah Fawcett is, let alone a FARA filing,’ said the official.” HOT ON THE LEFT “New Document Shows Inner Workings Of Trump’s Voter Fraud Probe,” from HuffPost: “Friday’s disclosure is significant because it shows officials on the probe have contacted officials with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Social Security Administration ― which suggests the commission may be proceeding with a plan to compare the voter data it’s collected against federal databases. … The commission had previously indicated it was considering running voter data from different states through a DHS database. … Observers have noted that any attempt to use DHS data to detect voter fraud is likely to produce false positives.” HOT ON THE RIGHT “Republicans rage at Rauner,” from Politico: “Until recently, the biggest question looming over Illinois politics has been whether Republican Bruce Rauner, the most vulnerable incumbent governor in the country, can win re-election next year. Now the question is whether Rauner can make it through a Republican primary. After the first-term governor signed a highly controversial bill last week expanding taxpayer-funded abortion in the state — becoming the first governor in decades to on his own authorize Medicaid payments for the procedure — Rauner’s political universe began collapsing on itself.”  DAYBOOK: Trump and the first lady are traveling to Puerto Rico's capital of San Juan today.

211,Frederic Lemieux,10052017,MarketWatch,9282017,"Published: Oct 3, 2017 3:28 a.m. ET Studies show more guns don’t make you safer and, yes, shootings have become more frequent By America has experienced yet another mass shooting, this time at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the strip in Las Vegas, Nev. It is reportedly the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. As a criminologist, I have reviewed recent research in hopes of debunking some of the common misconceptions I hear creeping into discussions that spring up whenever a mass shooting occurs. A study I conducted on mass shootings indicated that this phenomenon is not limited to the United States. Mass shootings also took place in 25 other wealthy nations between 1983 and 2013, but the number of mass shootings in the United States far surpasses that of any other country included in the study during the same period of time. The U.S. had 78 mass shootings during that 30-year period. The highest number of mass shootings experienced outside the United States was in Germany — where seven shootings occurred. In the other 24 industrialized countries taken together, 41 mass shootings took place. In other words, the U.S. had nearly double the number of mass shootings than all other 24 countries combined in the same 30-year period. Another significant finding is that mass shootings and gun ownership rates are highly correlated. The higher the gun ownership rate, the more a country is susceptible to experiencing mass shooting incidents. This association remains high even when the number of incidents from the United States is withdrawn from the analysis. Similar results have been found by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, which states that countries with higher levels of firearm ownership also have higher firearm homicide rates. My study also shows a strong correlation between mass shooting casualties and overall death by firearms rates. However, in this last analysis, the relation seems to be mainly driven by the very high number of deaths by firearms in the United States. The relation disappears when the United States is withdrawn from the analysis. A recent study published by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center shows that the frequency of mass shooting is increasing over time. The researchers measured the increase by calculating the time between the occurrence of mass shootings. According to the research, the days separating mass shooting occurrence went from on average 200 days during the period of 1983 to 2011 to 64 days since 2011. What is most alarming with mass shootings is the fact that this increasing trend is moving in the opposite direction of overall intentional homicide rates in the U.S., which decreased by almost 50% since 1993 and in Europe where intentional homicides decreased by 40% between 2003 and 2013. Read: These are the 10 deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history Due to the Second Amendment, the United States has permissive gun licensing laws. This is in contrast to most developed countries, which have restrictive laws. According to a seminal work by criminologists George Newton and Franklin Zimring, permissive gun licensing laws refer to a system in which all but specially prohibited groups of persons can purchase a firearm. In such a system, an individual does not have to justify purchasing a weapon; rather, the licensing authority has the burden of proof to deny gun acquisition. By contrast, restrictive gun licensing laws refer to a system in which individuals who want to purchase firearms must demonstrate to a licensing authority that they have valid reasons to get a gun — like using it on a shooting range or going hunting — and that they demonstrate “good character.” The type of gun law adopted has important impacts. Countries with more restrictive gun licensing laws show fewer deaths by firearms and a lower gun ownership rate. Read: Country guitarist, lifelong 2nd Amendment supporter: ‘I can’t express how wrong I was’ In most restrictive background checks performed in developed countries, citizens are required to train for gun handling, obtain a license for hunting or provide proof of membership to a shooting range. Individuals must prove that they do not belong to any “prohibited group,” such as the mentally ill, criminals, children or those at high risk of committing violent crime, such as individuals with a police record of threatening the life of another. Here’s the bottom line. With these provisions, most U.S. active shooters would have been denied the purchase of a firearm. Read: After Las Vegas shooting, here are 5 things harder to buy than guns Journalists sometimes describe mass shooting as a form of domestic terrorism. This connection may be misleading. There is no doubt that mass shootings are “terrifying” and “terrorize” the community where they have happened. However, not all active shooters involved in mass shooting have a political message or cause. For example, the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina in June 2015 was a hate crime but was not judged by the federal government to be a terrorist act. The majority of active shooters are linked to mental health issues, bullying and disgruntled employees. Active shooters may be motivated by a variety of personal or political motivations, usually not aimed at weakening government legitimacy. Frequent motivations are revenge or a quest for power. Beginning in 2008, the FBI used a narrow definition of mass shootings. They limited mass shootings to incidents where an individual — or in rare circumstances, more than one — “kills four or more people in a single incident (not including the shooter), typically in a single location.” In 2013, the FBI changed its definition, moving away from “mass shootings” toward identifying an “active shooter” as “an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.” This change means the agency now includes incidents in which fewer than four people die, but in which several are injured, like this 2014 shooting in New Orleans. This change in definition impacted directly the number of cases included in studies and affected the comparability of studies conducted before and after 2013. Some researchers on mass shooting, like Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, have even incorporated in their studies several types of multiple homicides that cannot be defined as mass shooting: for instance, familicide (a form of domestic violence) and gang murders. In the case of familicide, victims are exclusively family members and not random bystanders. Gang murders are usually crime for profit or a punishment for rival gangs or a member of the gang who is an informer. Such homicides don’t belong in the analysis of mass shootings.

After a House vote, the Senate approved a budget bill on Thursday. Republicans passed tax cuts through what is known as budget reconciliation, which requires just a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate with 52 seats. A persistent uptrend for stocks have been partially underpinned by the hope of tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, with a likelihood of the passage of a pro-business tax policy often propelling buying in assets perceived as risky. What are strategists saying? • “Up until a week ago there has been a lot of pessimism among investors that the Trump administration cannot pass any tax reforms, especially after the failure to repeal the [Affordable Healthcare Act]. But that seems to have changed last week, when the [Big Six] outlined their tax plan and more people now believe companies’ earnings will be boosted by lower tax rates,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated investors. The so-called Big Six includes the leaders of the House and Senate, national economic director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. • “The path of least resistance for markets seems to be higher. Revisions on the earnings front have been positive, the global growth theme is continuing, and I think valuations are fine, given where we are in terms of inflation,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. “There are no classic signs of exuberance that would derail the market’s trajectory, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see multiples and earnings go higher, absent some crazy macro shock that no one can forecast.” See: Some investors see signs stock market ‘on verge’ of a melt-up Which stocks are in focus?

""We think it's for real,"" the global head of commodities research told CNBC on Monday. ""We're in the middle of a bit of a sell-off, maybe even testing the $50 level for WTI, but the sell-off is profit-taking more than anything else, and the momentum in the physical markets, joined by the momentum in the financial markets, really point to a higher price between now and the end of the year."" On Monday, WTI fell towards $50 a barrel, while Brent slipped below $56. Citigroup's forecasts call for U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude of $54 a barrel for the fourth quarter, and $58 a barrel for Brent crude, the international benchmark. That would mark a divergence from the historical trend. U.S. crude oil more often than not falls in the final three months of the year, according to a study performed by CNBC using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho. U.S. WTI year-to-date performance, source: FactSet Energy markets are going to be ""in the driver's seat"" for the rest of the year after metals and other commodities led the rally in the first two months of the third quarter, Morse said. Commodities closely linked to China's economy are now ceding the way to the oil market, where the market is tightening after three years of oversupply, he said.Crude stockpiles in the OECD, a group of mostly developed countries, have recently fallen toward the five-year average as OPEC, Russia and other oil producers cut production to drain a global glut. They stood about 190 million barrels above that level in July, according to the International Energy Agency.""We're seeing inventories draw,"" Morse said. ""Finally, the market is recognizing that these draws in inventories of products and crude oil combined are for real and they're going to last through the end of the year. Maybe next year is a different story, but this year looks quite positive from now until the end of December.""As for natural gas, Morse said Citigroup would not be surprised to see prices at $3.70 per million British thermal unit by the end of winter. The current price is $2.91 per mmBtu. Natural gas prices rise in the winter as heating demand rises.Henry Hub natural gas 1-year performance, source: FactSetAfter that, it depends on when pipelines are completed to alleviate takeaway constraints in key producing regions like Appalachia's Marcellus Shale and the Permian Basin in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico.""We don't see much in the way of incremental pipeline, particularly from the northeast, coming into the market until late in 2018, so we think we're in a relatively tight position until then,"" he said.

""Finally, the market is recognizing that these draws in inventories of products and crude oil combined are for real and they're going to last through the end of the year. Maybe next year is a different story, but this year looks quite positive from now until the end of December."" As for natural gas, Morse said Citigroup would not be surprised to see prices at $3.70 per million British thermal unit by the end of winter. The current price is $2.91 per mmBtu. Natural gas prices rise in the winter as heating demand rises.

A recent Reuters poll revealed that output among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 50,000 barrels a day in September as the cartel’s overall compliance with its supply-cut deal fell to 86%. Several countries such as Saudi Arabia and Angola bore the brunt of the cuts while other countries such as United Arab Emirates, Ecuador and Iraq engaged in a bit of free riding, only complying by 30%, say analysts. “Weak production discipline within OPEC and the cut exemptions for Libya and Nigeria should mean in our view that closely observed OECD stocks will not fall quite as quickly as expected,” said Commerzbank analysts in a recent report.

As oil is priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies as the greenback strengthens. “It is not surprising to see some investors taking the chips off the table especially given the stronger dollar and possible higher U.S. oil production going forward and definitely OPEC’s production increases as well,” said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank. Recently oil had been gaining based on newfound optimism about OPEC’s ongoing effort to rebalance the market and eliminate about 2% of global supply with the help of external producers such as Russia. Oil producers at an OPEC-led meeting last month said the countries participating in the production-cut agreement, which include members as well as nonmembers of OPEC, reached record monthly compliance of 116% with the pact in August.

215,Alessandra Malito,10052017,MarketWatch,9282017,"Published: Oct 2, 2017 1:13 p.m. ET There are 7,000 flavors available for e-cigarettes, but all but one are banned for traditional cigarettes By E-cigarettes come in more than 7,000 flavors. By comparison, traditional cigarettes only come in one of those — menthol. What would happen if regulators were to ban flavors in e-cigarettes? • If the Food and Drug Administration banned the flavors in e-cigarettes but allowed them in traditional, or combustible, cigarettes, e-cigarette use would decline by more than 10% • If menthol in traditional cigarettes were banned, there would be a 4.8% reduction and most smokers would shift to e-cigarettes, while others said they would quit smoking altogether • Banning e-cigarette flavors could turn smokers toward traditional cigarettes, an adverse public health effect given that their use has been shown to cause cancer That’s according to new research by from Yale School of Public Health and the Centre for Health Policy at the Imperial College in London, and distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research. They conducted an experiment with more than 2,000 adult smokers and recent quitters. “Our results are timely and policy-relevant, suggesting which flavor bans are likely to be most effective in protecting public health,” the researchers wrote. Also see: Americans in this state are the biggest users of e-cigarettes What are the effects of e-cigarettes on smokers? E-cigarettes are considered less harmful than traditional cigarettes, though there are still risks associated with them. They have less nicotine (about 5% the amount of a traditional cigarette), but could still lead to addiction, mood swings and lack of attention, according to the U.S. Surgeon General. In May 2016, the FDA requested a ban on e-cigarette flavors until it could review their impact, but the White House Office of Management and Budget denied it. See also:  Are e-cigarettes a healthy way to quit smoking? Who are the people smoking e-cigarettes? Still, young smokers may be attracted to flavored e-cigarettes, which could become a gateway to traditional cigarettes.That’s one reason they’re being looked at closely by regulators. In some instances, an increase in e-cigarette laws has pushed young people to smoke traditional cigarettes, because they’re unable to obtain electronic ones. Most states have a minimum age of 18 for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, but in some localities, it is 21. Beginning in 2010, when states began instating e-cigarette laws, youth participation in traditional cigarette smoking jumped 1.4 percentage points, up from 0.7, according to another research report. What is the current regulation for e-cigarettes? Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration announced a proposal to lower nicotine levels to non-addictive levels in traditional cigarettes and examine the effect of flavors, including menthol, on attracting smokers to such tobacco products. Some cities already have bans on flavors for e-cigarettes and combustibles, including Berkeley, Calif., Chicago, New York, Boston and Minneapolis.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has taken flight, extending its break to record territory. Tactically, last week’s close (2,519) marks an inflection point — matching the third-quarter close — and is followed by a firmer floor matching the 2,508 breakout point. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has broken out. Consider that it concluded the third quarter (Friday) just seven points under a record close, and has taken flight to start the fourth quarter. The breakout point, circa 22,420, pivots to first support. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has also reached uncharted territory, notching its first close atop the 6,500 mark. Tactically, near-term support (6,477) is followed by a firmer floor matching the July peak, an area also illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended its break to record territory. Recent strength comes from a tight one-month range, and punctuates a successful test of major support. (The late-September low held at 6,343.9.) A near- to intermediate-term target continues to project to the 6,580 area, as detailed last week. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has also reached record territory, notching its first close atop the 22,500 mark. Near-term support matches the breakout point (22,419) and is followed by the former range bottom, circa 22,220. Both areas are better illustrated on the hourly chart. Conversely, a near-term target projects to the 22,620-to-22,636 area. (Take the Dow’s former record close minus the August low: 22,118 - 21,600 = 518 points. Then, add to the breakout point: 22,118 + 518 = 22,636.) Similarly, the S&P 500 has extended its strong 2017 uptrend. The prevailing upturn punctuates a bull flag pinned to the early-September breakout. Broadly speaking, U.S. stocks are off to a strong fourth-quarter start. Each widely-tracked U.S. benchmark has reached all-time highs — also known as uncharted territory, capped by limited resistance — on the fourth quarter’s first session. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has truly taken flight. Consider that the small-cap benchmark has notched seven straight record closes, though the breakout has accelerated across the prior four sessions. In the process, the IWM is near-term extended, and due to consolidate, though the directionally steep spike is longer-term bullish. The prevailing upturn constitutes follow-through on the late-2016 rally, illustrated on the three-year chart. Tactically, near-term support is poorly-defined, until established, though the breakout point, circa 145.25, remains the first notable floor. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has belatedly broken out, reaching record territory this week. Here again, the breakout point, circa 326.40, pivots to first support. Against this backdrop, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has extended its uptrend, reaching record territory to conclude the third quarter (Friday) and to start the fourth quarter (Monday). The prevailing leg higher punctuates a successful test of the 248 breakout point, nearly to the decimal. Collectively, an already firmly-grounded bull trend continues to broaden. Each widely-tracked U.S. benchmark has reached all-time highs against a persistently rotational sub-sector backdrop, partly detailed last week. In a related vein, the Russell 2000’s decisive breakout, and subsequent mid-cap follow-through, this week, strengthen the bull case. Tactically, an intermediate-term S&P 500 target continues to project to the 2,550 area. Conversely, the former range top (2,508) pivots to near-term support, and is followed by a firmer floor matching the 2,480 breakout point, and the 50-day moving average, currently 2,475. The S&P’s intermediate-term uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation. See also: Nasdaq’s FAANG-fueled downturn masks otherwise healthy sector rotation. The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Initially profiled Sept. 13, and revisited last week, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, the group is challenging a four-month range top closely matching the 200-day moving average, currently 41.75. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of trendline support. Underlying the upturn, the group’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has recently registered a year-to-date peak, improving the chances of eventual follow-through. Separately, the recent price action — the tight four-session range, matching resistance — is constructive, laying the groundwork for a potential breakout. (Notice the 50-day moving average has also ticked higher, consistent with an intermediate-term trend shift.)

The rally places the shares at 16-year highs, their best level since November 2000. Though near-term extended, the former range top matched major resistance — illustrated on the five-year chart — opening the path to potentially material longer-term follow-through. Tactically, the shares are attractive on a pullback. Near-term support (38.00) is followed by a firmer floor matching the breakout point, circa 37.50.

217, ,10052017,MarketWatch,9282017,"A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etc Catalonia has set Independence day from Spain for next Monday 9 October after holding a  referendum, Madrid declared illegal.Catalonia Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said he favored mediation to find a way out of the crisis but that Spain’s central government had rejected this. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government responded by calling on Catalonia to “return to the path of law” first before any negotiations. Mireia Boya, a Catalan lawmaker from the pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, said a declaration of independence would follow a parliamentary session on Monday to evaluate the results of the Oct. 1 vote to break away. “We know that there may be disbarments, arrests … But we are prepared, and in no case will it be stopped,” she said on Twitter. Puigdemont told the BBC he would ask the region’s parliament to declare independence following the referendum, which Spain’s government and constitutional court say was illegal and in which only a minority of Catalans voted. In a televised address on Wednesday night, Puigdemont said: “This moment calls for mediation. We have received various offers in the last hours and we will receive more.” Without specifically mentioning plans for an independence declaration, he added: ”I am sure that in the next few days we will show the best of our country when the institutions of Catalonia will have to apply the results of the referendum. “Today we are closer than yesterday to our historic wish.” Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government replied that Puigdemont had wasted an opportunity to put Catalonia back on a legal course. “If Mr. Puigdemont wants to talk or negotiate, or wants to send mediators, he knows perfectly well what he must do first: Return to the path of the law,” it said in a statement. Participants in the referendum opted overwhelmingly for independence, but turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot. Spain was only restored to democracy following the death in 1975 of military dictator Francisco Franco, under whom the Catalan language and traditions were suppressed.

218,Barbara Kollmeyer,10052017,MarketWatch,9282017,"Published: Oct 1, 2017 7:22 p.m. ET Early results show 90% support for independence in contested referendum By MADRID (MarketWatch) — Battle lines were being drawn on Sunday in Spain, as chaotic scenes emerged with hundreds reported injured after a banned independence vote in a wealthy northeastern region of the country whose heart is the city of Barcelona. Some in Catalonia, or Catalunya in the Catalan language, had spent Saturday night at one of the more than 2,000 schools that had been set up as polling stations in the region. But by early Sunday, it was clear that the Spanish government was as determined to stop the voting as those voters were to follow through with the referendum. Clashes persisted throughout the day. Late Sunday, Catalan officials said preliminary results showed 90% of voters approved independence. Read:  Catalonia leader: With 90% approval, ‘we have the right’ to be independent In recent days the government has sent in thousands of extra police, seized ballot boxes, arrested officials and shut down relevant websites. The defiant Catalan government on Sunday attempted to facilitate voting by allowing a ballot to be cast at any available polling station, using even blank pieces of paper instead of preprinted ballots. The regional government has said it will declare independence if a “yes” majority emerges from the 5.4 million eligible voters. About 2.3 million people cast ballots, the Catalan government said late Sunday, about a 42% turnout. President @KRLS Puigdemont votes in the #CatalanReferendum pic.twitter.com/tzxhpptTWu In several spots in the region, chaos gave way even before voting got underway, as national police officers clashed with those keeping vigil at polls, and those trying to vote, as well as in the streets. Hundreds injured, angry local politicians speak out By Sunday evening the number of reported injured had climbed to 844 as a result of clashes with the police, according to the region’s Health Department. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau called for an immediate halt to police operations in the region, saying it was “completely unacceptable for the police to be thrown at a populace,” in an interview posted on her Twitter account. She added that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was a “coward” who was “hiding behind thousands of police,” and called for him to resign immediately.

Police are firing rubber bullets at voters during protests as the independence referendum gets under way #CatalonianReferendum pic.twitter.com/XNEuwwgZ7S National police were filmed breaking down the door at one school to force their way inside and seize ballot boxes. There were reports that the national police had taken over in some places from the regional police, amid complaints that the latter weren’t doing enough to uphold order and stop the vote, which had been formally suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.

Today everything changed and I voted in fear :_( #CatalanReferendum Spanish government defends actions, as pro-unity protestors shout ‘Spain never divided’ For its part, Spain’s Interior Ministry reported nine police officers injured and two Civil Guard — a military force that is charged with police duties — officers injured. The ministry tweeted several images, such as this one of rocks being hurled at the Civil Guard: Continúa la violencia contra los agentes. @guardiacivil se retira expeditivamente bajo una lluvia de piedras lanzadas en grupo#EstamosporTI pic.twitter.com/wQsL5hMsL1 Encapuchados lanzan objetos a la @policia en Barcelona. Los agentes se retiran tras haber cumplido la orden judicial#EstamosporTI pic.twitter.com/7iswuhRNpS In a televised address, Rajoy blamed the Catalan government for not obeying the law that said the vote should not take place “I understand that some Catalans may feel frustrated and I regret that. The Catalan government tricked them into taking part” in the vote, he said on his Twitter account.: Ferits durant el #referèndum de #1OCT  a Catalunya (19.30h) #CatalanReferendum pic.twitter.com/slGsQGQMuW Rajoy reportedly fielded one call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, amid reports of rising injuries as other politicians across Europe made pleas for the violence to stop: German Chancellor Merkel holds phone call with Spanish PM Rajoy as Catalan govt says 465 people injured by police forces. Police violence against citizens in #Catalonia is shocking. The Spanish government must act to end it now. The euro moved lower as Asian trading got under way, falling against the dollar to $1.1791 from $1.1814’s closing level on Friday in New York, but recovered somewhat to $1.1801. Meanwhile in Madrid, home of the central government, Spanish-flag-waving residents gathered to protest the vote early in the day and support Spanish unity, massing in Plaza Mayor and then in the nearby square Puerta del Sol, blocking the street leading up to the plaza, chanting “Spain, united, never divided” and “Viva España” (long live Spain), and cheering passing police vans. ‘Yo soy español ‘ ‘espana unida nunca divida’ in Puerta Sol Madrid now #cataloniareferendum pic.twitter.com/k7Xk4bpThY “We are fed up,” said Maria Dolores Mateo, 68, a native of the Canary Islands, told MarketWatch. “Rajoy is right to do what he’s doing, but he can’t do it with force. He has to do with law, because if something happens the independents are the victims, and that’s what they want,” she said referring to the Catalans seeking the vote. As for the scenes up north, Mateo said she has been watching media reports and saw things getting “completely crazy and out of hand.” And that, she said, serves no purpose for anyone. Echoes of the past For some, the scenes in Barcelona and elsewhere brought up memories of repression in the region under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. The Catalan region was for the Republic during the Civil War, which was defeated in the late 1930s by Franco’s Falangist forces. Franco banned the Catalan language from public places and from being taught in schools, and there was no separate Catalan government. The police action Sunday appeared to open some old wounds. Emotional scenes. Older people weeping because they say they are reminded of the days of Franco #catalanreferendum https://t.co/oMxsWy0TH4 As an American who loves Spain with all her heart, I'm really concerned. Has Franco returned? Wtf? One of those present at the demonstrations earlier in Madrid, José Sánchez, 68, from the nearby town of Guadalajara, said he had turned up to “defend Spain and defend my country. They are cowards. They have used children as human shields,” he said of those seeking independence in Catalonia. There were reports of entire families, including children, sleeping at polling stations the night before the vote to prevent closures by the police. “I have friends in Catalonia, many who defend Spanish unity,” Sánchez said. “I hope that everything gets fixed peacefully.” Later in the evening, a very different protest took place in Madrid’s Sol plaza, where hundreds gathered, sang and chanted in protest of events that took place in Catalonia and in support of the region’s right to hold a referendum. It was a more tense affair with significantly more riot police presence, and cars, buses and taxis forcing their way through the crowds. At one point the crowd vented their fury at the police, who created a wide space in the plaza to prevent a separate crowd of anti-independence protestors from moving forward. Among those present was 31-year-old Juan Carlos of Segovia, but who lives in Madrid. He explained that half his family is in Catalonia and half were for the vote and half against. “The reason we are all here filling the Sol plaza is because we want to show the world and the Catalan people that we are in support of the right to vote,” he said.

219, ,10052017,MarketWatch,9282017,"Keep Me Logged In U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after data showed the labor market experienced its first contraction in seven years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.72 points to close at 22,773.67, with Chevron and Boeing contributing the most to the losses. The index also snapped a seven-day winning streak. The S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent to 2,549.33, with consumer staples and telecommunications leading decliners. The index also snapped an eight-day winning streak — its longest in four years — and also ended a streak of six straigh record closes, the longest such streak since 1997. The Nasdaq composite eked out a record high, rising 0.07 percent to 6,590.18. The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs September due in large part to two major hurricanes hitting the country. Last month markets the first time the U.S. labor market contracted since 2010. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 90,000 jobs. Despite the weak headline number, average hourly earnings rose to an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. Hourly earnings are closely watched by investors looking for indications on inflation. The unemployment rate also fell to a 16-year low of 4.2 percent. ""Trying to guess the headline number on this one was a fool's game,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. The report ""looks pretty sloppy from the top, but there's more good news than bad."" Treasury yields jumped after the report's release. The benchmark 10-year yield advanced to 2.362 percent, while the two-year yield rose to 1.51 percent, notching its highest level since 2008. ""Everyone knew the report would be confusing because of the distortions from [hurricanes] Harvey and Irma,"" said Richard Piccirillo, managing director at PGIM Fixed Income. ""But despite the distortions, average hourly earnings went down and unemployment went down. I think the bond market is reacting a bit to that."" The strong wages data also increases the chances of a Federal Reserve rate hike by December, according to Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. ""Over the past few months, they've reopened the path for another rate hike,"" he said. From before the central bank's previous meeting [to today], the odds of a rate hike have risen from about 30 percent to 80 percent."" Stocks were coming off yet another record-setting session. The S&P 500 posted its sixth straight all-time closing high on Thursday, marking its longest streak of record closes since 1997. The Dow and Nasdaq also notched record highs. The major indexes also posted strong weekly gains, rising more than 1 percent. Sentiment on Wall Street has been lifted lately by strong economic data and renewed hope of tax reform.

222, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"A federal judge has tossed out a U.S. government lawsuit accusing UnitedHealth Group of overcharging Medicare. The case is one of two whistleblower lawsuits alleging similar conduct. In one, the government says wrongful payments to UnitedHealth exceed $1 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice contends the big health insurer violated the federal False Claims Act so it could collect more money in Medicare reimbursements. The Medicare Advantage program pays insurers based on a person's health status: less for healthy enrollees, but more for people who are less well. The goal is to ensure insurers accept people who are sicker and likely to incur greater medical costs. The government accuses UnitedHealth of gaming the system and overstating patients' health risks. ""United violated the FCA by conducting biased, one-sided medical record reviews, thereby distorting the information it provided to the Medicare Program about the health status of Medicare beneficiaries in order to obtain payments to which it was not entitled from the Medicare Program."" But a federal judge in California overseeing one case says the government fell short on several points. Judge John F. Walter said the Justice Department failed to identify corporate officers who had vouched for the data's accuracy, or that corporate officers knew or should have known the records were false. The judge also said prosecutors had not shown the government would have denied payments if it had been aware of the purported misconduct. However Walter ruled the department can amend its complaint.

223, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has tossed a lawsuit by the U.S. government claiming UnitedHealth Group Inc obtained inflated payments from the government based on inaccurate information about the health status of patients enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. But Thursday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge John Walter in Los Angeles said the Department of Justice (DOJ) could try to amend its allegations to shore up some of the failings contained in a complaint filed in May against the insurer. Walter said the lawsuit had failed to identify any corporate officers who signed documents stating that data submitted to the Medicare program was accurate or allege any of those individuals knew the information was false. He also said the lawsuit claimed the alleged violations were material only in a “conclusory” manner and had not shown the government would have refused to make payments to UnitedHealth had it known about the conduct. UnitedHealth declined to comment on the lawsuit on Friday. The DOJ, which has until Oct. 13 to amend its complaint, had no immediate comment. The ruling marked a setback for the DOJ after it earlier this year intervened in two separate whistleblower lawsuits against UnitedHealth involving Medicare Advantage filed under the False Claims Act. Medicare Advantage, an alternative to the standard fee-for-service Medicare in which private insurers manage health benefits, is the fastest growing form of government healthcare, with enrollment of 18 million people last year. The lawsuit said that since at least 2005, UnitedHealth knew many of the diagnosis codes it submitted to the Medicare program for increased payments based on “risk” factors like health status were not supported by patients’ medical records. But the company turned a blind eye, the lawsuit said, funding and encouraging one-sided chart reviews of patients of HealthCare Partners, which provided services to UnitedHealth beneficiaries in California. As a result, UnitedHealth was able to wrongfully retain risk adjustment payments it received from the government, the lawsuit said. The complaint was filed in May after the DOJ partially intervened in a whistleblower lawsuit brought by James Swoben, a former employee of Senior Care Action Network Health Plan and a consultant to the risk adjustment industry. The DOJ later that month filed a second lawsuit accusing UnitedHealth of obtaining over $1 billion from Medicare to which it was not entitled. The case is U.S. ex rel Swoben v.

224, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the Obamacare law that Trump opposes. Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. He offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” costing the United States “nothing.” The expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some Obamacare requirements. These include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment. It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. People could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law. “I’ll also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “With Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself,” Trump added, saying the plan is “largely worked out.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump will make his announcement “by the end of Friday.” Trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. The association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. Such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under Obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. It is unclear when these plans would become available. It is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1. Experts questioned Trump’s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from Obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. The action could open Trump to legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue Trump if he tries to destroy Obamacare. The plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. That could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the Trump administration. Experts said Trump’s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the Obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the law’s protection that people with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be charged more. “There’s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets,” said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, referring to the Trump administration. “It unwinds the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance under the ACA,” Garthwaite said. Republicans have failed to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Gutting Obamacare was a top Trump campaign promise. Trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it “implode,” has undermined Obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule that will let businesses and non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co-payment. Trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare. The payments are estimated to be about $7 billion this year and help lower out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income consumers. Insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums. His administration has slashed the Obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law. ","

225, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran promised on Monday to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces a final decision on how he wants to contain the Islamic Republic. He is expected on Oct. 15 to “decertify” a landmark 2015 international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a step that by itself stops short of pulling out of the agreement but gives Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions. Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, as he rolls out a broader, more hawkish U.S. strategy on Iran. “We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. “If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he told a news conference reported by IRNA. Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are already on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday, “If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.” Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles. U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS). France said on Monday it was worried that classifying the IRGC as a terrorist group could exacerbate tensions in the region. Germany said it was worried Trump would decide Iran is not respecting the nuclear deal, negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and fears such a step will worsen insecurity in the Middle East. A U.S. pullout could unravel an accord seen by supporters as vital to preventing a Middle East arms race and tamping down regional tensions, since it limits Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear fuel in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that damaged its oil-based economy. The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s inspectors have repeatedly declared Iran in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal. Trump called Iran “a corrupt dictatorship” during his first speech to the U.N. General Assembly and said the nuclear deal was “the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”. The other five world powers in the deal were Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. The prospect of the United States reneging on the agreement has worried other partners that helped negotiate it. The Kremlin said that any U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal would have “negative consequences.” British Prime Minister Theresa May, who supports the nuclear pact, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes it, agreed in a phone call on Monday that they need to be “clear-eyed” about the threat Iran poses to the Middle East. “They agreed that ... the international community should continue working together to push back against Iran’s destabilizing regional activity,” May’s spokesman said. Despite the nuclear deal, Washington still maintains its own more limited sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and over accusations Tehran supports terrorism. Iran says it is developing missiles solely for defensive purposes and denies involvement in terrorism. The Trump administration aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over recent missile tests and what Washington has called its “malign activities” across the Middle East. The U.S. government imposed sanctions in July on 18 entities and people for supporting the IRGC in developing drones and military equipment. In August, Congress overwhelmingly approved the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” which imposed new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program, as well as sanctions on Russia and North Korea. In an interview aired on Saturday night, Trump accused Iran of “funding North Korea” and “doing things with North Korea that are totally inappropriate”. Qasemi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, said the U.S. accusations were “baseless”. He added, “Israel and some specific countries are raising these accusations to create Iranophobia.” ","

226, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday undermined requirements under the Obamacare law that employers provide insurance to cover women’s birth control, keeping a campaign pledge that pleased his conservative Christian supporters. New rules from the Department of Health and Human Services will let businesses or non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it. It was unclear how many employers would actually drop birth control coverage on religious grounds, and there were significant doubts that many big ones would. Within hours, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the administration in federal court in San Francisco to try to halt the rule, claiming among other things that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s requirement for separation of church and state. The states of Massachusetts and California also sued, and Democratic state attorneys general in another 16 states threatened legal action. “This is a landmark day for religious liberty. Under the Obama administration, this constitutional right was seriously eroded,” Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said. “The Trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for 62 million women,” Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said. “With this rule in place, any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control,” Richards added. Trump, who criticized the birth control mandate in last year’s election campaign, won strong support from conservative Christian voters. The Republican president signed an executive order in May asking for rules that would allow faith-based groups to deny insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds. The contraception mandate was implemented as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement. Trump and Republicans in Congress campaigned against Obamacare, as the law is known, but could not get enough votes to repeal it as they had promised. In its reasoning for the move, the administration said among other things that mandating birth control coverage could foster “risky sexual behavior” among teens and young adults. It overturned the Obama administration’s view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the government’s “compelling interest” to protect women’s health. “This administration’s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said. The administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception “on the basis of moral conviction” for non-profit and for-profit companies. Federal rules implemented under Obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control, but religious houses of worship were exempted. Some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that they could object on religious grounds. Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions. “Why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step?” Adler said. Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large companies, said, “Most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available.” According to one estimate, only 3 percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage. “HHS has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides - it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption,” said Mark Rienzi, one of the lawyers for the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns, which runs care homes for the elderly, had challenged the mandate in court. The Little Sisters and other Christian nonprofit employers objected to a 2013 compromise offered by the Obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage. The Justice Department released two memos that will serve as the government’s legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions, federal rules and grant making. In another decision popular with Trump’s evangelical supporters, the Justice Department on Wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees. Trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military. Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a major force in his 2016 election victory, remains strong, but has been slipping in line with his overall approval ratings, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos poll results.

227, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United States needs its own set of long-term goals for addressing such issues as climate change and hunger like those enacted by the United Nations, said a group on Monday as it launched a bid to elect candidates who back such an agenda. The group Future Now will solicit and support state-level legislative candidates to sign onto its list of goals to be achieved by 2030, the group told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The list is a tailored U.S.-version of the 17 U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global “to-do” list approved in 2015 by the 193 U.N. members. Among the SDGs for 2030 are reducing conflict, promoting gender equality and sustainable energy and tackling climate change, education, hunger, joblessness and other issues. America’s Goals are meant to be a non-partisan guiding framework to right the course in U.S. politics, said Jeffrey Sachs, a leading economist and a Future Now founder. “We’ve become remarkably polarized, remarkably short-sighted and short-term and remarkably non-goal-oriented in American politics right now,” Sachs told the Foundation in an interview. “We’re on the wrong track. Politics does not work right now.” Sachs is director of the Center for Sustainable Development at New York’s Columbia University. The other two founding members of Future Now are Adam Pritzker, chairman of Assembled Brands, a brand-building company, and Daniel Squadron, a former New York state Senator. The nation is failing to deal with issues from environmental threats to sky-rocketing health care costs, while politics in Washington is broken with a Congress that gets nothing accomplished and Donald Trump as president, Sachs said. “It’s not about Trump per se, though I think that Trump exemplifies just about everything wrong with our politics right now and actually poses a lot of dangers for our politics,” he said. The U.S. goals include paid family and sick leave, universal and affordable healthcare, ending hunger, limiting corporate special interest spending in politics, keeping the infrastructure in good repair, making communities resilient to natural disasters and investing in clean, safe energy. “What we need in the U.S. is different from what Spain needs or what Ghana needs or what China needs, but the broad idea that we’re aiming for prosperity, that we’re aiming for fairness and that we’re aiming for environmental safety is global,” Sachs said. The campaign launched with 10 candidates in the state of Virginia, who have received $160,000 in donations from Future Now affiliated donors, the group said. Candidates who sign on to the goals have access to a donor pool as well as support such as data, background and policy briefs, it said. ","

228, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected move to “de-certify” the international nuclear deal with Iran is driving a wedge between Europe and the United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China, Germany said on Thursday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has spoken out repeatedly against Trump’s likely step, but his latest comments aimed to spell out the impact it would have in starker terms. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” Gabriel, a Social Democrat, told the RND German newspaper group. “We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.” Trump is seen unveiling a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday, including a move to de-certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.” Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unravelling of the agreement. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that Iran is adhering to restrictions on its nuclear energy programme mandated by the deal to help ensure it cannot be put to developing atomic bombs. Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear work. Germany has close economic and business ties with Russia, although relations have soured since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. Berlin is also working to expand ties with China. Gabriel is expected to leave his post in coming months since his Social Democrats have vowed to go into opposition after slumping badly in the Sept. 24 election, opting not to reprise an awkward “grand coalition” with Merkel’s conservatives. Gabriel on Monday urged the White House not to jeopardise the nuclear agreement, saying such a move would worsen instability in the Middle East and could make it more difficult to halt nuclear arms programmes in other countries. In the interview released on Thursday, he said the nuclear agreement was being treated “like a football” in U.S. domestic politics, but the issue could have serious consequences. He said Russia was watching developments closely, including the divisions between Europe and the United States. “That doesn’t exactly strengthen our position in Europe.” Ultimately, Gabriel told the newspaper group, there were only three countries - the United States, Russia and China - that could avert a new nuclear arms race. “But those countries mistrust each other so much at the moment that they are not working together sufficiently. It must be in our interest to press for more trust.” ","

229, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"HAVANA (Reuters) - The Cuban diplomats expelled from the United States this week included all those dealing with U.S. businesses, Cuba’s embassy in Washington told Reuters on Thursday, dealing another blow to bilateral commercial ties. In an escalating crisis between the Cold War foes, the Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 diplomats to protest Communist-run Cuba’s failure to protect U.S. embassy staff in Havana from a mysterious spate of alleged health attacks. “Due to this decision, the activities developed by the Economic and Trade Office of the Embassy of Cuba to the United States ... will be seriously affected,” one Cuban diplomat said in a farewell message to a U.S. group that takes investors to the Caribbean’s largest island. The Cuban embassy is often the first step in the process for U.S. companies to explore opportunities and make a pitch. Officials help them submit a trip proposal, seek out counterparts at state-owned enterprises in the centralized economy, and receive a business visa to travel to Havana. Whether the embassy will still be issuing such visas remains unclear, given one diplomat will remain in the consular section. On the American side, the downgrade of the U.S. embassy - Washington last Friday ordered the departure of all non-emergency staff - will likely make it harder for U.S. companies to find their way in Cuba. “It’s the chilling effect of a diplomatic crisis,” said Pedro Freyre, a Cuban-born attorney who heads the international practice at law firm Akerman. Some U.S. companies may choose to stay on the sidelines until relations improve, he said, adding that his clients already pursuing opportunities in Cuba were staying the course as they saw it as a long-term play. U.S. companies flocked to Cuba in the wake of the detente former Democratic President Barack Obama agreed in 2014. The original frenzy in U.S. commercial interest in Cuba was tempered by the realization that doing business in cash-strapped Cuba was difficult and even harder with a trade embargo in place. Businesses now face a hostile stance from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, who in June ordered tighter restrictions on travel and trade that have yet to be unveiled. Last Friday, his administration issued a warning on travel to the island. ","

231, ,10122017,Reuters,10052017,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech. China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors. China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said. Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected. To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance. That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse. Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month. Having direct state backing will make it much harder for these groups to argue they are independent actors. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

In particular, he believes that financials and health care stocks are likely to maintain value even amid a general selloff, given that both sectors are trading at relative discounts to the broader market. While Pouey did not mention any specific stocks in his remarks to CNBC, one may look at the largest by market cap as reasonable proxies for each sector. Within financials, these are: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), $349 billion; Bank of America Corp. (BAC), $284 billion; and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), $280 billion. Among health care stocks, they are: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), $365 billion; Pfizer Inc. (PFE), $218 billion; Novartis AG (NVS), $206 billion; and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), $195 billion. Merrill Lynch's Pouey likes financials based on strong dividend growth, at about 10% per year, and share repurchase programs that are proceeding ""very, very aggressively,"" as quoted by CNBC.

233,Dan Mangan,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a new executive order aimed at expanding health-coverage options and reducing costs for millions of Americans — an order that Obamacare defenders fear will damage gains made under that health-care law. The executive order eyes loosening rules surrounding the offering of health plans by small businesses, as well as rules about enrollment in short-term health insurance plans. Those short-term plans are less expensive and less comprehensive than Obamacare health plans. Trump, who has been stung in recent months with his inability to get Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with a new law, said the order is ""taking the first steps to providing millions of Americans with Obamacare relief."" ""With these actions, we are moving toward lower costs and more options in the health-care market, and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare,"" Trump said during the signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room in the White House. ""This is something that millions and millions of people will be signing up for, and they're going to be very happy. This will be great health care,"" the president predicted. But the order will not necessarily have any significant practical impact on the nation's health insurance system by the time Obamacare's next open enrollment season starts next month. That's because of the time it takes to propose and take public comment on the potential changes. And the order does not lift the Obamacare rule that most Americans have some form of health insurance for the year or face a tax penalty. As a result of that omission, and other factors, it is not clear if the order will have a negative effect on enrollment in individual health plans sold on Obamacare plans that go into effect in 2018. Nor is it clear that enrollment in other health plans will increase significantly. ""I don't know that it accomplishes all that much"" in the short-term, said Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health-care policy research group, when asked about the order's impacts. But Trump said, ""Today is only the beginning."" ""In the coming months we plan to take new measures to provide our people with even more relief and more freedom,"" Trump said, referring to other executive actions to reform rules related to the Affordable Care Act. Claxton said if the administration ends up loosening enforcement of the Obamacare coverage mandate, ""it could be disruptive, and it could happen very quickly."" Trump noted that in 2017, one-third of all counties in the United States had just one insurer offering Obamacare plans. ""Next year, it looks like nearly half of all counties in our country — think of that — one-half of our counties will have one insurer,"" Trump said. Trump also pointed to ""skyrocketing"" health-care premium prices for Obamacare plans in a number of states in 2017 as evidence of the ""Obamacare nightmare."" The order comes after months of failed efforts by Trump and Republican leaders to get Congress to pass legislation that would repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump, who still wants such legislation to happen, on Thursday blamed congressional Democrats for universally opposing repeal-and-replace bills. But the president also noted that it was a ""small handful"" of Republican senators whose opposition to those bills doomed them in recent months. One of those senators was Rand Paul of Kentucky, who attended Thursday's signing session because he has advocated for making it easier for small businesses to form associations that can buy health insurance collectively. That idea is a key point in Trump's order. The order directs the Labor Department to ""consider expanding access to Association Health Plans"" for American businesses, so small businesses can easier band together to offer health coverage. The order contemplates AHPs being formed across state lines. The president said that by banding together, companies will be able to ""buy affordable and competitive health coverage."" That, and allowing AHPs to buy coverage across state lines, will result in ""staggering"" competition for their business among insurers, Trump said. ""Insurers will be fighting to get every single person signed up,"" he said. However, it is not clear if the Labor Department will end up allowing people who are not employed by companies in such AHPs to get health insurance coverage through them. Obamacare advocates fear that if that were to be allowed, it could reduce the number of healthy people buying individual health plans on Obamacare exchanges. That, in turn, would lead to greater price hikes than have already been seen. Advocates also worry that the AHP plans will not be as comprehensive in terms of covered benefits as Obamacare plans. The order also directs several federal agencies to consider reversing an Obama administration directive that limited enrollment in short-term insurance plans to just three months. Short-term health insurance currently does not satisfy Obamacare's coverage mandate, which means that someone enrolled in only those plans is subject to a tax penalty. Claxton said that if the administration only ends up increasing the amount of time a person can be enrolled in a short-term insurance plan, ""it would not have a big effect on undermining the [Obamacare] marketplaces,"" which sell more comprehensive, and more expensive, health coverage. Claxton said that because individuals would still be subject to the penalty, there would not be a big influx of people into short-term plans and exodus out of Obamacare marketplace plans. But ""the issue would be, what comes next?"" Claxton said. If the administration liberalizes rules about the duration of short-term health plans, and then also makes it easier for people to get hardship exemptions from Obamacare's mandate, it could lead healthy people who don't need comprehensive benefits to sign up in large numbers for short-term coverage. Dave Dillon, a fellow of the Society of Actuaries, said of Trump's order, ""Overall, the proposal has potential to bring increased instability and volatility to the health insurance markets by separating the market into two smaller pools."" ""Longer length short-term plans may further segment the market,"" Dillon said in emailed comments. ""The proposal offers more choice to consumers in terms of coverage options,"" Dillon said. ""Healthier consumers will likely be able to enroll in plans with lower insurance rates, while more medically complex consumers may be subject to significant rate increases."" Trump's order also will direct federal agencies to consider making changes to rules around health-reimbursement arrangements, which allow employers to set aside tax-advantaged money that workers can use for out-of-pocket health costs. And the order directs multiple agencies to review the level of competition among health-care providers and insurers nationally, with an eye toward identifying actions that could increase competition. Officials said the administration is concerned about the large volume consolidation in the health-care sector since the adoption of the ACA, which they said has had the effect of increasing prices and potentially affecting the quality of health care.

234,Elizabeth Gurdus,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"As the Dow Jones industrial average continues to reach intraday all-time highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer decided to look back at the stocks that drove the index's gains in the third quarter. The Dow increased by 4.9 percent in the third quarter as the stock market avoided a historically typical September downturn, so the ""Mad Money"" host examined the top 10 stocks responsible for the move. The aerospace giant contributed a massive 37.5 percent to the Dow's gain. Boeing's longer-than-expected order book, strong defense-oriented business and new Dreamliner aircraft model drove buyers to its shares, Cramer said. Caterpillar contributed 11.6 percent to the Dow last quarter. Together, Caterpillar and Boeing accounted for nearly half of the Dow's move. ""The source of CAT's strength? The company had a true blowout quarter thanks to a pickup in orders, very lean inventories and a very low table of employment. It's a big winner as China and Europe return to growth ... and you'd better believe they'll sell more equipment for the rebuild effort in the wake of the recent hurricanes here,"" Cramer said. The big bank's shares gave the Dow a 10.8 percent gain. While Goldman's management acknowledged that the bank's last quarter wasn't so great, the stock nevertheless got a boost from a softer regulatory environment and investor optimism about Goldman's future success. Chevron, an oil stock, accounted for 9 percent of the Dow's third-quarter move. Cramer attributed this to the company proving it wouldn't have a problem paying out its large dividend or surviving in a low-priced oil environment. The move in shares of this credit card giant gave the Dow a 7.8 percent boost last quarter as Visa continued riding the global shift from paper-to-plastic. ""I think what shocked people here is that the modern-day Visa was built by Charlie Scharf, who recently left that job, but his successor, Al Kelly, seems to be handling things perfectly well. I admit I was worried when Scharf left,"" Cramer said. ""I was wrong. Kelly's amazing. Visa's business is humming."" Few companies fared better than UnitedHealth when Congress failed to pass the Trump administration's plan to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare, Cramer said. The health care giant contributed 7.5 percent to the Dow's gain as it pulled out of money-losing exchanges. ""Even after this run, UNH remains one of the cheapest stocks I follow and if it ever comes down, I'd love to add it to the trust,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. After hurricane season wreaked havoc on parts of the United States, investors rushed into Home Depot's stock as a way to play the rebuilding process. The stock's boost added 7.2 percent to the Dow. The consumer technology colossus added 7.1 percent to the Dow's third-quarter move after a better-than-expected quarter and resurgence of bullish sentiment among analysts on Apple's new iPhones. After a series of disappointing quarterly earnings reports, American Express bounced back with an uptick in profitability, pushing shares upward. The stock gave the Dow 4.4 percent of its gain. Contributing 3.9 percent to the Dow's third-quarter climb, Microsoft proved that Azure was a dominant cloud-based system that helped accelerate the company's growth. ""It's become a must-own tech name for big-time portfolio managers who like growth but also want to sleep at night,"" Cramer said. All in all, Cramer learned three key things from looking at the group in its entirety: ""Put simply, these names went higher largely because they were the only game in town, cash-heavy stocks of companies that are doing better than we thought that could grow in an era of slow growth,"" Cramer said.

The company will decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, according to an email from Amazon viewed by CNBC and a source familiar with the situation. If it decides to make that move, it will start expanding its senior team with drug supply chain experts. Amazon typically spends years researching opportunities before it telegraphs its intentions. The opportunity to sell drugs online is alluring given its market size -- analysts have estimated the U.S. prescription drug market at $560 billion per year. Amazon is well aware of the complexities, say sources familiar with the company's thinking. Amazon declined to comment. In the past year, Amazon has ramped up its hiring and consulted with dozens of people about a potential move into the pharmacy market. The consumables team, which includes groceries, kicked off the research, with the division's vice president, Eric French, taking the lead. It brought on Mark Lyons from Premera Blue Cross to build an internal pharmacy benefits manager for its own employees, say multiple people familiar. According to one of the people, it's possible that the push into the broader drug supply chain hinges on its success with this effort. In May, the company kicked off its search for a general manager to lead its pharmacy push, externally dubbed ""healthcare."" Analyst firm Leerink has separately reported that Amazon will get into the pharmacy management space and expects an announcement within the next year or two. Goldman Sachs published a report on the topic in August of this year, speculating that Amazon will ultimately look to improve price transparency for consumers and reduce out-of-pocket costs. Amazon already has a business selling medical supplies online, such as gauze and thermometers. It also has a health team called 1492, which is focused on both hardware and software projects, like developing health applications for the Echo and Dash Wand.

237, ,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"BARCELONA, Spain -- A senior European Union official has pleaded with the Catalan leadership to step away from the brink of a divisive call for independence and resort to dialogue with Spain's government instead. European Council President Donald Tusk addressed Catalonia's president directly, hours before Carles Puigdemont is expected to make an announcement on the region's bid for secession. Tusk said in Brussels that ""I ask you to respect in your intentions the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible."" Tusk added that ""diversity should not and need not lead to conflict whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for the whole of Europe."" Before a meeting of the EU's Committee of the Regions, Tusk said that ""let us always look for what unites us and not for what divides us. This is what will decide the future of our continent."" Catalonia's regional leader was addressing parliament Tuesday in a highly anticipated session that could spell the birth of a new republic, marking a critical point in a decade-long standoff between Catalan separatists and Spain's central authorities. Security was tight in Barcelona and police cordoned a park surrounding the legislative building, where the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to walk a fine line when he addresses regional lawmakers. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont presides over a cabinet meeting at the regional government headquarters, the Generalitat, in Barcelona, Spain October 10, 2017. The speech will need to appease the most radical separatist-minded supporters of his ruling coalition - but Puigdemont faces shutting down any possibility of negotiating with Spain if he adopts a hard line. The Catalan leader hasn't revealed the precise message he will deliver in the address at 6 p.m. (1600GMT), but separatist lawmakers and activists have said they won't be satisfied with anything short of an independence declaration. A full declaration of secession -or an outright proclamation of a new Catalan Republic - would certainly be met with fierce opposition by central Spanish authorities, who could take the unprecedented step of suspending the self-government of Catalonia and taking over some or all powers in the region. Puigdemont himself could end up in prison. Some 2.3 million Catalans - or 43 percent of the electorate in the north-eastern region - turned out to vote in the Oct. 1 independence referendum, which the Spanish government said was illegal. Regional authorities say 90 percent who voted were in favour and declared the results of the vote valid. The ballot was marred by violence as riot police tasked with stopping the voting clashed with voters, leaving hundreds injured. The political deadlock has been compared in Spain to a ""train collision"" and has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis in more than four decades, since democratic rule was restored following the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. In the streets of Barcelona, expectations were divided between those who want to see the birth of a new nation and others opposed to the idea. Some feared a drastic backlash from the Spanish central authorities. ""I am thrilled,"" said Maria Redon, a 51-year-old office worker. ""I've been waiting for this all my life. We have fought a lot to see an independent Catalonia."" But Carlos Gabriel, a 36-year-old waiter, said that is ""impossible."" ""He won't do it. By doing so he would be diving into an empty pool,"" he said referring to Puigdemont's parliamentary address. ""These people know it's just a dream. Something very complicated. Something that will carry many negative consequences for all of us."" In Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain, people were reading between the lines of politicians' statements to try to figure out what's next. Regional government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to comment on what Puigdemont's address would be about during a press conference on Tuesday. The Catalan parliament's governing board acknowledged Tuesday morning it had received the results in last week's disputed independence referendum. But a parliamentary official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the board refrained from putting the results through normal parliamentary procedures to elude any legal problems, because the referendum and its legal framework have been suspended by the national Constitutional Court. Assemblea Nacional Catalan and Omnium Cultural, two of the main civil society organizations driving the secession bid, have called for people to gather near Barcelona's parliament building to back the regional government in ""welcoming the republic."" Hundreds of thousands have turned out for street protests in Barcelona and other towns in the past month to back Catalan independence and protest against alleged police violence during the vote. Those committed to national unity have also staged separate, large-scale rallies. The tension has impacted the economy, with dozens of companies already relocating their corporate address away from the troubled region to remain under Spanish and European laws if Catalonia manages to secede. The moves of the firms' bases do not so far affect jobs or investments - but they don't send a message of confidence in the Puigdemont government. Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail and blamed Puigemont's ""radical"" and ""irresponsible"" government for the current standoff. ""This is not about independence, yes or no. This is about a rebellion against the rule of law,"" de Guindos told reporters in Luxembourg, where he was meeting with European Union ministers. ""And the rule of law is the foundation of coexistence, not only in Spain but in Europe."" Instead of a paintbrush, Alexandre Farto uses drills and jackhammers to create large-scale public art that exposes layers of a city's history. Once seen as a vandal known by his tag, Vhils, he has fueled the flourishing street art scene in his native Lisbon, Portugal, where murals have added a colorful touch to the otherwise overlooked or mundane, and he has transformed buildings in cities around the world by exposing layers of history.

Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Catalonia Sunday to call for unity, voicing their opposition to last week's non-binding and referendum on independence on October 1 that was declared illegal by the Spanish government and constitutional court. Police in Barcelona estimated that 350,000 people had attended the march while Societat Civil Catalana, an anti-independence group that organized the protest, put the number of demonstrators at 930,000. Waving both Spanish and Catalan flags, demonstrators on Sunday praised the actions taken by the Spanish government to prevent the symbolic referendum vote, and criticized local politicians who have encouraged secession from Spain. Responding to the latest pro-unionist march in Catalonia, Raul Romeva, the region's foreign affairs minister, told CNBC on Sunday that there had been a larger pro-independence response from the Catalan people and that needed to be addressed by Madrid. ""For six to seven years in a row we have seen millions of people on the street. I'm not talking about governing, I'm talking about society. We have seen millions of people on the street demanding to approach, politically, that issue. I think that the people deserves, they have earned the right to be listened (to),"" he said. ""Obviously from that perspective we have been trying to have that dialogue to engage with the Spanish government, unfortunately we are alone at the table. So in order to have a negotiation or dialogue you need a counterpart and so far we are alone at the table and you need two to tango,"" he added. Sunday's protest centered in the regional capital Barcelona and will likely put more pressure on the regional government to drop its claims to independence. The vote saw 90 percent of the 2.28 million people who voted choose independence. Voter turnout was low at 43 percent, however, although the regional government said 770,000 potential voters were not able to vote following the Spanish police's crackdown on voters and polling stations. Spanish Health Minister Dolors Montserrat, who originates from Catalonia, delivered a brief statement at the rally on Sunday: ""Today is a very important day for all the Catalans and today we are going to put a stop to the independence, and we will … And we want to build for the Catalans and with all the rest of the Spanish people, this grand nation and this great democracy all together."" The government in Madrid has urged its counterpart in Barcelona to resist declaring independence although Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has rejected calls for mediation to resolve the impasse with the Catalan government. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has said he will address the regional parliament on Tuesday evening and it's still uncertain whether he will go ahead with declaring independence — as he stated last week — particularly after a strong show of support in favor of unity with Spain. Rajoy said Madrid could use its constitutional powers to suspend Catalonia's autonomy and prevent it from declaring independence. In an interview with the El Pais newspaper published on Sunday, the Spanish leader suggested he could trigger article 155 of the constitution, which would allow him to dismiss the regional government and call fresh local elections. He said he would not ""rule out anything that is within the law."" Amid the uncertainty, a number of Spanish companies headquartered in Catalonia, including banks Sabadell and Caixabank, have opted to relocate due to fears over secession. Meanwhile, Spanish energy company Gas Natural and water firm Agbar have announced moves to Madrid. The decisions to relocate likely dealt a blow for the Catalan government and comes after ratings agency Moody's said in a report Friday that Catalan independence would have ""broad negative, albeit highly uncertain, credit implications for a wide range of bond issuers in Spain and the region."" Xavier García Albiol, the president of Catalonia's Partido Popular (People's Party - the governing party of Prime Minister Rajoy), told CNBC on Sunday that the relocations were worrying. ""It's obvious that we are very worried about businesses fleeing Catalonia due to the political instability. The only thing I ask for is patience, and most importantly, that the President of the Generalitat (Puigdemont) and his colleagues urgently denounce the movement for independence in public to give the Catalan people and businesses peace and security,"" he said.

239,"Mike Juang, special to CNBC.com",10122017,CNBC,10052017,"It is most definitely brain surgery. The skull is opened, and electrical leads are implanted directly into the tissue of the brain. These wires are connected to a small device that sends a small dose of electricity into the brain. The treatment, called deep brain stimulation, means patients suffering from neurological disorders like Parkinson's Disease can have the chance to live a normal life without constantly fighting their own bodies. Tremors, or involuntary shaking while a limb is at rest, can be noticeably reduced or even eliminated. Patients regain mobility and are able to walk and even talk normally. YouTube is filled with hundreds of videos demonstrating the ""life-changing"" effects of a DBS device when active, as well as what patient functionality returns to when the device is turned off. Popularly known as a ""brain pacemaker,"" deep brain stimulation works by blocking errant signals from damaged brain cells to ""reset"" the brain's natural rhythm, said Dr. Michael Okun, the medical director of the Parkinson's Foundation and chairman for the Department of Neurology at the University of Florida. During surgery a hole is inserted into the patient's skull and electrical leads are implanted directly into the brain's tissue. The leads are threaded out, and the skull is closed. These wires are threaded behind the ears, down the neck and to the front chest area, where they are connected to a watch-size device that emits a controlled amount of electricity. The entire unit, from wires to generator, are all buried just below the skin. The generator, a self-contained unit with a battery, sends pulses of electricity through the leads to stimulate areas of the brain, reducing or in some cases even eliminating the most debilitating parts of the disease. A small, cellphone-size remote control can be used to adjust the ""dosage"" of electricity and can turn the device on and off. One of the major manufacturers of the device is Medtronic, which has been active in the U.S. market the longest — it first received approval for use of its DBS system for advanced Parkinson's in 2002; the FDA approved it in 2016 for use with patients who have had Parkinson's for at least four years. Abbott Laboratories acquired the DBS business with its acquisition of St. Jude Medical last year; and Boston Scientific, which currently offers its DBS system in Europe, hopes to receive U.S. approval by year-end. The three companies' business lines focused on neurology had roughly $1 billion in combined sales in the most recent reported quarter. Medtronic's brain therapies group is the leader, with $522 million in sales in the most recent quarter, though it does not break out DBS sales specifically. Abbott's neuromodulation unit had $300 million in global sales, with approximately 10 percent coming from DBS sales, but it says DBS has been growing since launching in the United States last year. Each DBS surgery can cost between $35,000 and $50,000, and upward of $70,000 to $100,000 for bilateral procedures (both sides of the brain), according to the National Parkinson Foundation. These estimates include the cost of the surgery, devices, anesthesia, hospital fees and physician fees. Device costs can run to tens of thousands of dollars: The Medtronic DBS unit costs $23,000. Since DBS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease, Medicare and most private insurance carriers will cover most, if not all, of the costs of the operation, according to NPF. Still, as with any surgery, there are risks. ""The main risk is bleeding,"" said Dr. Matthew Wodziak, a neurologist who specializes in Parkinson's Disease at Loyola Medicine. ""When we find the right place to put something inside the brain, you have the risk of bleeding [and] infection,"" he said. Properly implanted leads do not cause brain damage, and only create microlesions, or small cuts in the brain tissue, and a buildup of glial tissue, cells that support neurons, Okun said. In addition to the complications associated with surgery, DBS devices also require physical maintenance. Batteries in the devices are not rechargeable and need to be replaced, Wodziak said. The hardware can wear over time and may need maintenance. Medtronic says its devices are not susceptible to hacking, and include encrypted signal technology and proprietary algorithms to communicate with remote controllers. Despite progress, experts and doctors are trying to determine exactly how electrical stimulation alleviates the symptoms of brain-related disabilities, Okun said. Doctors are still debating if DBS directly affects the function of brain cells, if it simply introduces changes in the chemical composition and biology of the brain, or some combination of the two. What they do know, Okun said, is that introducing electricity blocks the signals of cells close to the lead while stimulating the ""pipes"" connecting neuron cells, called axons. It also alters the neurochemistry of the brain, the ""ocean"" of fluid in which neurons sit. ""We're using a tiny amount of electricity to influence a large circuit that is malfunctioning, and we're trying to reset the brain,"" Okun said. The electricity restores normal oscillations of the brain, improving the patient's symptoms, he said. In the case of tremors associated with Parkinson's disease, it can make it much more manageable or even stop the tremors completely. The treatment can be used to tackle additional neurological problems and other disorders, Wodziak said, including epilepsy, seizures and dystonia, which is the sustained, involuntary contraction of muscles and can lead to painful cramping of the feet or hands, curling toes, or turning and twisting of the neck. A version of the same technology can even be used on the spinal cord. This year, Dr. Andre Machado of the Cleveland Clinic performed the first DBS surgery for stroke recovery using the Boston Scientific Vercise system. It is also considered for depression and weight loss. Although the treatment has been around since the 90's, there have been some incremental advances to the technology, including leads capable of focusing electricity to increasingly specific parts of the brain and smaller generators capable of connecting to devices using Bluetooth. Abbott's DBS system was the first to be approved in the United States with a ""directional lead,"" which allows physicians to direct current more precisely than traditional DBS. It also allows for system control from an iPod Touch. Future deep brain stimulators may even include sensors that allow it to respond dynamically to changes in brain patterns, said Brett Wall, senior vice president of brain therapies at Medtronic. The company also hopes to reduce the size of devices, eventually making generators rechargeable or even small enough to embed directly on top of the skull, Wall said. Wodziak cautioned though that the surgery is only optimal for patients that will drastically benefit from it. Due to the nature of the surgery, patients opting for DBS it must undergo a bevy of tests from an army of specialists: A neurologist and neuropsychologist to screen patients. A neurosurgeon to perform the implant. A psychiatrist and rehab team including physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists to assist recovery. The best candidates for DBS Have had PD symptoms for at least five years. Have ""on/off"" fluctuations (when a person cycles between ""on"" time, when the medication is working to control symptoms, and ""off"" time, when medication has worn off and PD symptoms return), with or without dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is involuntary, irregular, writhing movement that can range from mild to violent and can sometimes be unpredictable. Continue to have a good response to PD medications, especially carbidopa/levodopa (though the duration of response may be insufficient). Have tried different combinations of carbidopa/levodopa and dopamineagonists under the supervision of a movement disorder neurologist or specialist. Have tried other PD medications – such as entacapone, tolcapone, selegiline,apomorphine or amantadine – without beneficial results. Have PD symptoms that interfere with daily activities. Parkinson's disease patients are also advised to consult with a movement disorders specialist, a neurologist who has completed specialized training in PD and movement disorders, or in the least with neurologists in practice who have become experts in this area through their experience caring for many patients and by taking continuing medical education courses. ""We don't put it in first,"" Okun said. ""We very carefully go through an interdisciplinary evaluation, we find out what's disabling to the patient, we have to make a conscious decision; can our technology tackle all the symptoms in our patient?"" The treatment is meant to be a supplement to, and not a replacement for, medication and other treatments. Patients also need to be aware that many post-operative visits for both DBS programming and medication adjustments will be required, most frequently during the first 6 months following implantation. Many medical centers that offer DBS also require monthly visits for the first six months. DBS is removable and reversible. It's not a cure for Parkinson's Disease. Michael J. Fox, the actor who has become synonymous with the fight to find a cure for Parkinson's and whose foundation offers guidance for those considering the procedure, has spoken in the past about the potential benefits of DBS, but also its limitations. He was first diagnosed in 1991 and in the late 1990s, Fox had a type of brain surgery to relieve his tremors, a thalamotomy — which destroys a small portion of brain tissue — before DBS became an option. Fox told CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta back in 2010 about his decision to not pursue DBS: ""The next time they go in my brain, I want them to get it done. … If there is something that they can do that will be curative or restorative … in a much more fundamental way than a mechanical stop gap, a kind of pacemaker. ... That's just my personal preference, but it's been tremendous in people's lives, hundreds I've met, and thousands that have had the procedure, deep brain stimulation. It's been huge, the improvement ... the people that couldn't walk, people that had a hard time functioning.""

240,Evelyn Cheng,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"The head of the largest U.S. bank said Thursday that if tax reform does get passed, the company will hire more workers. Over time, JPMorgan Chase will be ""boosting jobs and wages more than we otherwise would have"" if corporate taxes are cut, the bank's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, said during a post-earnings release conference call with media. ""Had we done it right five years ago, we would have grown much faster,"" Dimon said. JPMorgan said in its 2016 annual report that the company has more than 243,000 employees worldwide, with more than 167,000 in the United States. CFO Marianne Lake added on the call that ""the tax rate is only one piece of the equation"" when considering whether to hire more workers or raise wages. Dimon is chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of more than 200 chief executive officers of major U.S. companies, and has spoken strongly about the need for more business-friendly legislation in the United States. This week, Dimon said in a commentary piece on NBC News' THINK website that American workers will be the real beneficiaries of corporate tax reform. The piece cites estimates from accounting firm EY that showed ""a competitive 20% corporate tax reduction could support the creation of as many as 2 million new jobs if the tax savings went to new job creation."" The article also pointed to an April survey from Business Roundtable that said 76 percent of 123 responding chief executive officers would increase hiring if tax reform is successful. The GOP released a tax framework last month that proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. However, many remain skeptical on whether tax reform will be passed soon, if at all. Congress has struggled to pass legislation on health care this year despite a Republican majority.

243,Sophie Bearman,10122017,CNBC,10052017,"Cyndi and Cameron Dieterich never imagined they'd be spending the bulk of their newlywed years in Cave Springs, Arkansas. Yet that's exactly what happened. It all started with a job offer. Cyndi, 36, was working in Seattle for a major wine production company when an executive called to offer her a promotion. A sales director position had opened up, servicing the company's biggest buyer, Wal-Mart. The position came with a big title change and a raise, but there was a catch: The job was in northwest Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is headquartered. ""He said to me, 'I'm pretty sure I know the answer to the question, and I think it's going to be no,'"" she recalled. But for Cyndi and Cameron, 37, the decision wasn't so obvious. The couple had $60,000 in combined consumer debt. With an additional $76,000 in student loans and a mortgage, their net worth was negative. On one hand, Arkansas would offer a fast financial recovery due to its low cost of living and affordable housing. It ranked as the fourth-least expensive state to live in 2017, according to CNBC's annual Top States for Business study. A downside, though, was that access to the arts and culture would be more difficult, and Cyndi and Cameron would be giving up on the quality of life they'd become accustomed to in a major metropolitan area. Ultimately, the appeal of Arkansas outweighed the negatives. Cyndi called her company back. ""The answer's not 'no,'"" she said. Cyndi and Cameron met in Los Angeles in 2011. They'd each found their way to the city many years earlier. For Cameron, a television producer, Hollywood called to him right out of college. ""I had the itch to go work in the entertainment industry. So as soon as I graduated, I packed up my Nissan Sentra and my dad and I drove to Burbank, California,"" he said. Cyndi's path was less direct. She'd lived in Minnesota, Colorado and Oregon before moving to Los Angeles in 2010. Once there, each fell in love with the city despite its high cost of living. When rent was tight one month, they'd use a credit card to pay for food. If they needed to fly home for Thanksgiving, the plane ticket would get bought on credit. ""It was just kind of survival,"" Cyndi said. It wasn't until the pair got married in 2013 that they decided to get serious about their finances. They hired Sophia Bera, a certified financial planner who specializes in advising clients in their 20s and 30s. Bera set the couple straight. ""I think what Sophia said to us after she looked at our finances initially was, 'You have some work to do.' Which we knew,"" said Cyndi. Arkansas would help them get that work done, but money wasn't the only impetus for the move. Cyndi and Cameron were hoping to grow their family, and they felt Arkansas would be a good place to raise a baby. Moving had financial risks, too. Cameron would have to quit his job. The couple's Seattle home became key to quelling any financial concerns they had about the move. Even though Cyndi and Cameron had lived there only for 1½ years, the house had appreciated significantly. They were able to close on the home and walk away with some cash. ""We would have thought, 'Hey, let's put that money into the new house so we have a lower payment,'"" said Cameron. Bera encouraged them to only put down 5 percent on the Arkansas house and aggressively pay down their high-interest consumer debt instead. Following her advice, the couple paid off $50,000 of their debt and refinanced one of their car loans to 2.99 percent from 6 percent. Things got more complicated when Cyndi gave birth to Oliver. The baby was born with a congenital heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallot and would need heart surgery at age 6 months. Cameron postponed his job search to focus on caring for Oliver. ""Having a child with a congenital heart defect, there's inherently expense there. We were able to get through the first year with him and focus solely on getting him where he needed to be from a health perspective and just pay the bills that we needed to pay to take care of him,"" said Cyndi. Oliver's health costs wouldn't have been any different had the couple stayed in Seattle. More from My Success Story The couple turned $10,000 into am $800,000 a year clothing business  From political refugee to C-suite success Because they have insurance through Cyndi's company, the couple had the luxury of choosing where Oliver's heart surgery would be performed — and they could have chosen anywhere in the United States. Ultimately, they selected a surgeon in Houston. But they say that overall child-care costs, like day care, clothes, and food, are much less expensive in Arkansas and helped offset some of the out-of-pocket health costs. Despite the challenges of a move, heath-care costs, unemployment and child expenses, Cameron and Cyndi still managed to increase their net worth that first year in Arkansas. Today, their finances are even stronger. The Dieterichs have eliminated all $60,000 of their consumer debt and are steadily decreasing their outstanding student loans. On top of that, Oliver is healthy and Cameron is working at a creative agency as a producer. In many ways, Arkansas' affordability is to thank for their swift financial success. Still, the Dieterichs say they may not live in Arkansas forever. But they do see the state as a key player in allowing them to triple their savings account and grow their family. And for now, they're enjoying it. ""I think overall we are still pleasantly surprised that we like it here,"" said Cameron. ""It's where our family started, where our child was born and no matter where we end up as we go through life, we're going to have very fond memories of our time here.""

Fitness tracker company Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) announced its long-anticipated Ionic smartwatch at the end of August. While Fitbit's stock has seen a positive bump since the announcement, it is still down more than 50% over the past 12 months. FIT data by YCharts The smartwatch has an app gallery, enhanced coaching features, and a huge community of users that could be a catalyst for additional revenue growth. Read on to see how these features could benefit Fitbit investors. Image source: Fitbit In early August, Fitbit CEO James Park said that the  smartwatch would release with an app ""gallery"" with a ""select number"" of partners. Now that the smartwatch has been released, you will find it has popular functions and apps from companies including Pandora, Starbucks, Accuweather, and Strava, which is a social network for athletes. And this is just the start. In that early August call with analysts, Park talked about the Ionic's powerful software developer kit (SDK), which is a set of tools that enables programmers to create smartwatch apps. Park explained that when the company worked with UnitedHealth Group to create the Motion program for its members, it didn't have this SDK capability, and the effort to develop was considerable from both Fitbit and United Health. Having the app gallery and SDK will aid development of more health-focused apps in partnership with insurers or medical device manufacturers -- like the recently announced partnership with Dexcom -- and should drive incremental revenue. Fitbit's mission starts with, ""To empower and inspire you to live a healthier, more active life."" Fitbit reported in May 2017 that it had sold 63 million devices and had more than 50 million registered device users. Management has said that a smartwatch with coaching features could expand its user base by 40 million to 80 million people.  The Ionic is just this device. Fitstar, which is Fitbit's subscription-based fitness app, finally has a device that will make its features easier to use, be more accessible to more people, and have more specific coaching programs to attract users. The culmination of these benefits is rolled into a personalized app called Fitbit Coach and will be released in the fall. The Fitbit Coach personal training app will have introductory pricing of $7.99 per month or $39.99 per year. With Fitbit Coach, users will have workouts displayed on the device, running and walking audio coaching, and app-adjusted workouts based on their feedback. Coming in 2018, Ionic will allow you to access adidas coaching expertise. These coaching features should allow Fitbit to expand its addressable market and drive additional recurring subscription revenue through its premium apps. While the Ionic smartwatch doesn't enhance Fitbit's community features, it should attract new users and grow the overall Fitbit community. Having a large and active community attracts individual users and should also entice corporations hoping to reduce healthcare costs by giving employees Fitbits. Fitbit's corporate wellness programs accounted for less than 10% of overall revenue in 2016, but they could be a growth driver in the future and the Ionic community could be a selling point for corporations hoping to save money on healthcare. When someone buys a Fitbit device, access to the community and its features automatically comes along with it. Fitbit only releases its user community numbers annually, and at the end of 2016, the company had 23.2 million active users. This large user base makes it more likely that a friend or relative may already be on the platform, so the new Fitbit user may be able to engage with someone they know. Park said the community features benefit users by ""building healthy habits, [enabling] friendly competition and curating a supportive and positive environment.""  Fitbit Ionic smartwatch coaching features help Fitbit add incremental recurring revenue and expand its total addressable market. The app gallery and growing user community should boost partnerships with health-related companies. These are the new Ionic smartwatch features that investors should love. ","

Your issue isn’t time management (BUSINESS NEWS) Cult-favorite drink, Topo Chico, was just bought by Coca-Cola which is creating all sorts of mixed emotions. Published on By If you thought that sparkling water was a trend that would die soon, think again. On Monday, Coca-Cola purchased mineral water brand Topo Chico for $220 million dollars. Topo Chico currently is distributed in 35 states, with almost 70 percent of its total sales in the state of Texas alone. This acquisition marked a big investment into a trend that has soda consumption at its lowest point since 1985. Coca-Cola already has two sparkling water brands: Dasani Sparkling and Smartwater sparkling. This purchase is its latest acquisition that many think can compete with big rivals like Nestle’s Perrier and Sundance Beverage Company’s LaCroix. Topo Chico, the prized mineral water brand of Mexico and the Austin craft cocktail scene, has had a long relationship with Coca-Cola. The plant that still bottles and manufactures Topo Chico since its creation bottled the first ever bottle of Coca-Cola in 1920s. Coca-Cola says they have no plans to change the location of its manufacturing in Monterrey, Mexico, nor the brand’s existing image. “It’s important for us to maintain the relevance with the core Topo Chico fanbase while introducing the brand to new people,” VP of Emerging Brands Matt Hughes said. “We’ll continue to protect the prestige of the brand, which is authentic to its heritage and hip without being pretentious.” After the announcement of the acquisition, brand die hards took to Twitter to offer their two cents about the acquisition of Topo Chico by Coca-Cola. The most positive comments were about the opportunity to have Topo Chico distributed across the country so that those not located in its sales area could drink the sparkling beverage. Of course, the cult-like fan base that Topo Chico has was generally disturbed by the fact that their beverage of choice could be “corrupted” with high fructose corn syrup or the recipe changed. Plus, there’s a good old fashioned dose of twitter snarkiness at announcement of the news as well. I’m fair to partly excited about Coca Cola adding Topo Chico to the family.

Published on By Personality tests are some of the most popular posts on social media. At least once every day, I see “What Sauce Are You?” or “What Disney Princess Are You?” on my Facebook feed. Millions of people take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test each year, a more professional personality test. When you take the MBTI, you’re presented with a personality type, based on four characteristics, extrovert-introvert (E/I); sensing -intuition (S/N); thinking-feeling (T-F); and judging – perceiving (J/P). Many organizations use the MBTI in the workplace to group people into teams or to select candidates for employment. After all, wouldn’t you want an extrovert over an introvert for a sales position? But using the MBTI to make serious business decisions may not be a good idea. Here’s why. It’s unethical to use the MBTI in certain cases. According to the creators of the MBTI, “It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants. The administrator should not counsel a person to, or away from, a particular career, personal relationship or activity based solely upon type information.” Personality type does not imply competence or preference. The creators of MBTI also state this in their ethical position on the personality test. I am an introvert. I will always be an introvert. But I just found out that some of my colleagues believe I am an extrovert. I can adapt to a social or business situation to get the job done. If a job used the MBTI to place me on a team, they may see that I don’t always behave like an introvert. Similarly, a job may overlook me for a position based on my MBTI type. Either way, it’s kind of unfair. How can you use the MBTI? The MBTI can be beneficial to help people understand their own tendencies. I remember one thing from the test, a question about whether you base your decisions on how they impact others. Years ago, I would have answered that totally in the positive. I always considered others in making my decisions, whether I should or shouldn’t have.  Today, I would answer that question much differently. My understanding of boundaries is much better. Your MBTI type can be a great communication starter, especially in teams. But it shouldn’t typecast you into a particular position on the team. Employers should not be using the MBTI to pigeonhole their employees.  (BUSINESS NEWS) Remote working is increasingly more common here are some tips on how to ask your boss for flexibility. Published on By To some people, “working remotely” sounds like a code word for sitting around in your PJs watching Netflix all day. But many professionals, managers and otherwise, recognize the value of the flexibility and independence that comes with working from home occasionally. Depending on your role, your commute, and your personal life, benefits of working from home could include:
Reallocating commute time into productivity. 45 minutes each way means an hour and a half of wasted time – and you’re probably already tired by the time you get to work.
Uninterrupted periods of focused work. Coworkers are a wonderful resource for collaboration, and even friendship, but even the most awesome people can be annoying when you really, really, really need to focus.
Energizing quiet time. Introverts often underestimate how much they mentally need this, and everyone can use a reset once in a while.
More time to spend with kids/spouse/friends. Again, you can save time on your commute, and often you can rearrange your schedule to work a few hours after the kids have gone to bed/the movie is over/etc. If you’ve already made that list of benefits in your head a thousand times while knocking your head against your office desk, a work arrangement that includes remote work days is definitely something you should try, if your organization and your manager will agree to it. But for many potential remote workers, getting the boss onboard seems like an unsurmountable barrier, and they may have even made the request in the past but been denied. This article is designed to help all those interested in remote work successfully navigate that daunting process. Before we get into the details of potential concerns your boss may have, you should establish a clear reason (or reasons) why you’d like to transition to a schedule that includes working from home. If you can’t articulate this fundamental point, your boss will be much more likely to suspect that your motives are less than pure. Both personal and professional reasons are totally valid, but being totally open is the only way to set yourself up for success. With these motivations in mind, develop a proposal for your boss that focuses on how working from home will benefit your organization, not you. Your boss knows that you’re asking for this flexibility for yourself, but a happier and more productive you is way better for the company than a miserable, exhausted you. Your proposal should include a schedule or plan, and you should probably start slow with the work from home days. If your goal is to work from home two days a week, suggest spending one day at home every two weeks for a set period, like two or three months, so that your boss will have a built in trial period to agree to. A couple of pro tips: aside from ensuring that you’re in the office on important regular meeting days, you should avoid Friday as your work from home day to be sure it doesn’t look like you’re after three day weekends. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are ideal, because they’re in the middle of the week, and you may often have a lot of tasks and projects coming to a head on these days that you’ll need to focus on for completion. You also need to go out of your way to make sure your boss understands that your flexible schedule would work both ways; that is, even if you’re scheduled to work from home this Wednesday, you’ll come into the office for an important meeting or check in. Go the extra mile without being asked and your boss will have no reason to worry about flexibility. Finally, the best way to prove the value of remote work is to actually work better remotely. That means you’re in regular contact with your team and your boss, whether you’re asking questions or just sending status updates on your projects a couple of times a day. Over-communicating is important here. It also means accomplishing a little more than you might at the office, or digging a little deeper. If you finish something early, ask coworkers over chat or phone if they could use your help for an hour. Make yourself available, just as you would in the office, and no one will be left wondering what you do all day. A dedicated workspace in your home can do wonders for your productivity – it’s hard for anyone to do hard, concentrated work on their sofa with a lap desk. As the end of the established trial period approaches, it would be prudent to present your boss with a summary of your remote accomplishments over the past few months. If you’re sending regular updates, this should be easy to determine. And no matter how sure you are that you’ll love working remotely, you should be mindful of any loneliness or feelings of isolation, and address them by staying in contact with coworker friends over chat, or scheduling lunches with them once in awhile, especially if you work from home the majority of the time. If, after careful preparation and thoughtful presentation, your boss still isn’t having it, don’t be afraid to ask again in a few months. And in the meantime, you could bolster your case by taking a day or two of unscheduled time off and just working from home unasked. If you can show your boss what the company gets out of it, they’ll be hard pressed to say no.  Published on By A new trend is emerging as more fast-food restaurants are turning toward senior citizens to join their workforce rather than teens, per Bloomberg. Walmart has been hiring older workers for years and taking a lot of scrutiny over it, but according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force is changing. In the last 30 years of the 20th century, the number of workers aged 55 and older was the smallest segment of the workforce. Around 2003, this group was no longer the smallest share. Baby Boomers and Gen Xers are now living longer and working longer. The BLS estimates that the number of older Americans who will keep working after the age of 65 will grow by 4.5 percent through 2024. On the other hand, the number of teenagers expected to enter the workforce is expected to drop by 1.4 percent. Many workers in their prime are decreasing, due to the opioid epidemic, unaffordable childcare, and the incarceration rate, which some experts say is beginning to creating a labor shortage. In addition, seniors often have soft skills that teenagers just don’t have. After years in any industry, older Americans know how to be on time, deal with customers and navigate the ins and outs of working. Managers have to teach these skills to teenagers entering the job market. For seniors seeking work in fast food, they aren’t typically interested in moving up the corporate ladder. Financially, it can make sense for a business to hire an older worker over a teenager. A business gets the experience of age without having to pay any more for it. Would your business benefit? We recently reported on the litigation regarding the word “overqualified” being a code word for “too old to hire.” There’s also a concern that older Americans will carry a higher cost or not stay in a position for a long time, but it’s time to kick those stereotypes out. The labor force is changing and fast food chains are leading the charge. Will businesses keep up? Or will employers disregard candidates who will bring much more to the job than just being a body who shows up?

246,Asit Sharma,10122017,Fool,10052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Tiffany & Company (NYSE:TIF) has a 180 year history as a luxury brand, and the stock has jumped 30% in the last year. They also look at the latest acquisitions from leading consumer brands this week, including Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) $220 million purchase of Topo Chico and Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) acquisition of a New York City start-up. A full transcript follows the video. Asit Sharma: Hey, Vince! Thanks as always for having me back! Shen: Sure. Fools, we're going to turn our attention to the high-end luxury corner of the consumer retail world for this episode. If we watch the clock and we have enough time, we'll also offer some quick updates on the back half of this show as well. The company states outright in its 10-K that the brand is its single most important asset, and it'll invest heavily to maintain it brand perception. That means premium customer service, paying for spots for its stores in high-end malls and luxury areas, selling lots of expensive diamonds and precious stones. Jewelry makes up 90% of the company's business, specifically products with diamonds make up almost 60% of annual revenue. Asit, the stock is up about 30% in the last year, handily outperforming the broad market. Can you tell us about some of the latest developments at the company? Sharma: Sure. The most important development begins with the top line. Sales have dropped about 6% over the last two years. In 2015, Tiffany & Company booked $4.25 billion in sales, and that's dropped over the last two years to about $4 billion in 2016. So as a result, Tiffany replaced its CEO Frederic Cumenal, who was only there for 22 months, with Alessandro Bogliolo in July. Shen: Good timing there. Sharma: Tiffany & Company, the next CEO you hire, can you please give us a name that's easier to pronounce? But having said that, Bogliolo is the former CEO of Italian jeans and fashion house Diesel Clothing Company, and he also had a long stint in Bulgari & Company, which, for those of you who love high-end fashion and maybe live in a big city, New York, Chicago, you've certainly seen these beautiful stores and their beautiful products, a worthy competitor to Tiffany & Company. So Bogliolo's mission is to expand Tiffany's cachet, as Vinyce mentioned, to a younger demographic, to millennials, to revitalize the brand without impacting that strong resonance it has as an aspirational brand, and a brand that, at the end of the day, stands the test of time. So those are the most recent developments for Tiffany & Company. Shen: I would say, the timing there, by the way, you mentioned, of the CEO was perfect, because his official start date happened to be yesterday. As we watch the progress the company makes, it's really starting day one right now. Some big opportunities that you see management mention and see them play out in the numbers a bit, there's this new leadership change, they talk about new product categories that are intended to appeal to some of those younger consumers that you mentioned, they talk about the growth of their online sales, which are still a small portion of the company's business at this point, I believe 6% as of the end of their physical 2016. Then, they also have their international footprint to lean on. You'll see that going back to some of the quarterly reports, you'll notice a trend in that the Asian markets, which the company breaks down into Japan and Asia Pacific. And for that Asia Pacific region, China makes up over half of that, those regions have tended to deliver strong results, either flat or positive growth compared to some of the declines in the company's biggest market, the Americas and the U.S. specifically, which makes up almost half of all revenue. I feel like a company like this will face some cyclical challenges in that economic downturns will often hurt luxury sales. The company struggled a bit during the financial crisis. But another long-term headwind that I want to focus on is something you mentioned, and it's kind of topic on people's minds right now, and that seems to be decreasing interest in diamonds, especially among younger consumers. With some of the controversies surrounding sourcing for precious stones, for example, with conflict diamonds, and in general, we've talked in other industries, whether it's with restaurants, consumer packaged goods, snacks, beverages, whatever it may be, people are worried about environmental concerns, sourcing, sustainability. And that seems to be flowing into this business as well. What is the company really facing here? Sharma: The company is facing a similar problem that we've seen in many industries that we talk about here where consumer goods stands. We'll talk about Coca-Cola a little bit later in this show, but that's a great analog. Coca-Cola has been impacted by changing consumer tastes, the fact that if you have small children and you've grown up in this society and have a more sustainable bent about you and are more health conscious, you're not necessarily going to give your kids as much of that beverage, Coca-Cola, as you drank when you were small. The same with Tiffany -- we have these mini cycles ... larger ways where consumers' perceptions of the brand and what's behind the brand evolve. And for Tiffany, it has to be careful about the sourcing of its diamonds, and it has to show the consumer that they can enjoy the products, that is the aesthetic quality of the product, the brand cachet, but also feel good about the provenance of that. Where did the diamond come from? Is it responsibly sourced? Is it a blood diamond? So that's a drag that Tiffany is going to have to meet and continue to have a brand perception that customers can feel good about. I think they can beat that challenge. What's interesting to me is, it's going all the way to the other extreme to deal with a little bit less high-margin revenue from the retail diamonds in that it's in the wholesale diamond business. This is something that I really wasn't as much aware of until I was doing prep for this segment. The company has a fast-growing business, particularly in Asia, in the wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's got a much smaller margin than the luxury jewelry, the pendant necklace that you buy at their flagship stores. However, in these last two quarters, the company has booked $61 million of revenue from wholesale diamond trade. Now, that's only 3% of Tiffany & Company's total revenue over the last two quarters, of that $1.8 billion I mentioned. But it's growing at a 50% clip year over year. So you can see how, within a few quarters, if it can maintain that focus, this low margin part of the diamond trade will be a bigger portion of the company's bottom line, a little bit of a drag on earnings but it's a smart way, just as Coca-Cola has moved away from only selling those sugary sodas, and as we'll talk about a little bit later, and is moving into some other types of products that customers can feel better about. Shen: Why don't we just jump right into that, Asit? I think this is going to be a focus for the new CEO as he heads up the operations for the company. Can you tell us a little bit about what the company is expanding into, but also trying to help, in terms of appealing to the young consumers that it wants to bring on board? Sharma: Sure. It's two big picture avenues that Tiffany & Company is taking. One, like other companies of its ilk in many industries, it's firming up its approach to e-commerce. And this is one industry which, you can see Amazon.com is not as much of a threat as it is with so many companies we talk about on this show. It almost seems that, whatever segment we have, Vince, Amazon looms large. Shen: Yeah, absolutely. Sharma: Tiffany & Company has a really nice e-commerce portal that tries to recreate the experience of being in the stores. It's difficult, let's be honest, to match the experience. If you've had the opportunity to walk into one of their larger stores, it's impossible to actually recreate that. But you can recreate some of the ambience, some of the desire around the product. And what I love about this is, Tiffany & Company has done a smart job of breaking its products into different pricing. Very quickly, when you visit the homepage after a click or two, it just flat-out gives you the choice -- here are products under $250, then it gradates up to $1,000, $2,500, and beyond, sort of like when you sort on Amazon, which, I'm somewhat cheap on some things, so I will often sort by price. You don't feel like you've lost luxury of experience, but you can quickly go to the price point that interests you, and I think that's a really good approach on their part and will increase the flow of millennial traffic. Millennials as a whole, I don't think they're cheap like me, I'm a bit older, but I think they're thrifty. They know what they want, and they know how much they're willing to pay for certain products, especially luxury items of the type that Tiffany sells. So that flow going through their portal to completing that, converting that customer, is pretty well done. The other thing that the company is also pragmatically undertaking is its product line. They're moving more into products like watches. This year, they will improve and expand their women's line of watches, which is a huge market. The current CEO has experience with that. For those of you who are into the fashion house of Diesel, you know that they have very attractive watch offerings. So not simply price points, but looking at what millennials buy, what's important to them. They may not be in the market for a beautiful diamond or heart-shaped brooch like your grandmother was, but they could use a watch because they're tired of staring into their phone for hours a day. Shen: Sure. I think that's a piece of the strategy the company will have going forward. At the same time, I'm a little bit skeptical, when we were doing research for this, I found a lot of headlines talking about how high-end jewelry, diamonds are on this strong downward trend in terms of popularity, like we mentioned, with millennials and younger consumers in general. But I feel like, with a company like Tiffany, with a very aspirational brand, they talk about how they will invest in their inventory to have lots of very pricey and extravagant diamonds and precious gemstones, because they want customers to go into the store and feel like there are things that they cannot afford. It's aspirational. And I feel like that's something for young consumers that they will grow into over time as their tastes change and mature, as they grow older. I think the long-term picture for this company, there are always going to be people who appreciate what Tiffany represents in terms of the luxury world. So it will always have that moat. Any final thoughts from you, Asit, in terms of this challenge the company faces, and thoughts on what the outlook might be? Sharma: I think the company will be able to meet the challenges we talked about earlier. And also, these declining trends of interest in diamonds. That's somewhat geographically based. In the United States, we have a very advanced society on the curve of industrial development. But again, in China, if you look at India, which has a burgeoning middle class, and they love to buy gold objects, diamonds are the next step up. There is a market out there. It depends on where their focus is, and the company avidly seeks locations in Southeast Asia to expand. So they know where their future customers, who will still be interested in diamonds, exist. And I think that's simply numbers for them, that's one way they'll be able to counteract the trends that we see in places like Europe and the United States, where that interest is somewhat declining. Shen: Perfect. Thank you, Asit. For our next update here, we have two stories. The first is with Coca-Cola. They opened the week with the news that the company would be acquiring Topo Chico for over $200 million. I've never had a chance to try its products myself, but Topo Chico is an imported sparkling water brand from Mexico that's very popular in selected regions of the country, especially Texas, which makes up about 70% of Topo Chico's sales. The brand has a long history dating back over 100 years to 1895, and it seems to be a big part of its allure and popularity with consumers. Asit, this deal is made as part of Coca-Cola's Venturing & Emerging Brands unit. We've talked about this unit before, it's a really interesting part of the company. Can you tell us about this unit within the Coca-Cola umbrella? Sharma: Sure. VEB, Venturing & Emerging Brands group, functions as a venture capital arm within Coca-Cola. Their mission is to go out into very far reaches of the soft drink or beverage world and find companies that are developing brand which Coca-Cola can buy. Now, for Coca-Cola to buy a brand, it really has to have $10 to $20 million in sales. Then, it can scale those sales up to $200 million and beyond. But VEB doesn't necessarily have to find companies that are selling that much from the outset. They really take an ear-to-the-ground approach and try to meet with small companies when they're just forming up in start-up phase, and keep in touch with them, as many venture capitalists do with technology companies, in the hopes that they find a brand or label just starting to gain traction, and they have the advantage of the first-mover, they have a relationship with the entrepreneurs and can write a big check, acquire the rights, and then scale. I think this group has been effective. Some of you drink Honest Tea, that was a transaction that the VEB Group consummated. And this week's transaction, also consummated by the VEB Group, they did it with the Mexican bottler ARCA Continental for $220 million. And this is interesting for those who are wondering how Coke will parlay the strategy of small, tuck-in acquisitions. Previously, Coca-Cola was buying up some small labels and manufacturing product. But the company has sold its bottling operations over the past year to bottling partners in North America and throughout the world. And by next year, Coca-Cola is going to exist more as a marketing company than an actual manufacturer. And this is one of the first transactions we see how great that business model is, because Coca-Cola actually acquired the rights to Topo Chico rather than buying all of the manufacturing and trying to go bottle this product itself. Shen: Yeah. I want to mention a few other aspects of how the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit approaches its investments, and kind of apply that to this latest purchase that they've made for about $220 million. So the unit was established in 2007, and they're looking for these potential billion-dollar brands. But the thing is, they're focused on products that are outside of Coca-Cola's traditional carbonated soda and sugary beverages, because the business unit claims to think five to 10 years ahead about where the beverage industry is going, and the signs of the leaves seem to point away from some of those traditional Coca-Cola sodas. And you mentioned Honest Tea, for example, this was a pretty early success for the company. They made an initial investment of over $40 million in 2008 when the company had less than 100 employees and just $30 million in revenue. Almost a decade later, Coca-Cola has totally taken over the Honest Tea brand, and the latest number from 2015 puts Honest Tea sales at almost $180 million. So the formula here is, they have Phase I, they identify the opportunities. Phase II, they take a venture capital role and make that initial investment. And that seems to be where we are here with Topo Chico. The next phase, then, is when they start taking a greater role and usually a bigger investment as the brand grows its reach. This seems to be a pretty standard formula for the company, in terms of what options they have for Topo Chico. It has 70% of its sales in Texas, it has really strong market share there, and management has actually spoken to this idea about recreating this success and building more ""Texases"", basically growing Coca-Cola's share of the still-growing sparkling water industry, which at this point is still dominated by private label store brands that you might see at the grocery store, for example. Estimates I found pinned Topo Chico revenue at less than $70 million for 2016. So we know this is not exactly moving the needle for a company this size. Coca-Cola, keep in mind, despite the fact that their revenue is going down because of this restructuring they've done, you mentioned in terms of the bottling operations, they still had almost $40 billion in sales in the last 12 months. I think, basically, you have to think about what the company is going to be able to leverage, and I think Coca-Cola is legendary in terms of its ability to leverage its marketing machine, and allow Topo Chico to ride that and scale. Even though it's only available in 35 states and regions of Northern Mexico already, the brand is not that familiar outside of Texas. And I'm sure Coca-Cola will be working a lot to remedy that. But if you are a Coca-Cola shareholder or you're considering a position in the company and you're trying to adopt a Foolish long-term perspective, I guess the question becomes, do these satellite brands and venture capital-like investments have the ability to eventually offset some of the major declines that are expected with traditional soda consumption? What do you think, Asit? Sharma: In this case, it certainly does. Very interestingly, as you mentioned, revenues for Topo Chico are 70% in Texas. You can visualize a small band on the map of the U.S. border, this drink is actually manufactured in Northern Mexico, and it's sold in Northern Mexico. South of Northern Mexico and north of Texas, there's tremendous potential. Some of our listeners may know, Mexico is the second largest market for Coca-Cola outside of the United States, and Coca-Cola has been hit hard by Mexican government tariffs on sugary soft drinks. So this is an excellent way for Coca-Cola not just to take an exciting brand and scale it but to make up for lost revenue. It's exactly what you want to see as a long-term shareholder. What's the strategy to replace the declining revenue? And that is such an opportunity that falls into Coke's hands. I don't how many of our listeners, maybe you can tweet to us if you've tried it, those of you who are down deep in the South -- I've tried it. I've got my hands on some several months ago from my local Latin American store. It's an interesting drink. It has a very colorful label. Effervescence is a little bit higher than sparkling waters you might buy here, at least to me. It's got a little bit of a salt taste to it. So it's something that offers a different segment opportunity for Coca-Cola, a new brand that they can push out there, and it's beloved by hipsters in Texas. So, there's that cachet that we talked about with Tiffany. They may have some hipster cachet that they can expand on. I think it absolutely does fulfill that problem that you mentioned, Vince. We'll watch this one to see how far they can scale it in the next few years, for sure. Shen: I think it's interesting, that popularity that it has in Texas, has a lot to do, I think, with the heritage of the brand itself, again, dating back over 100 years. The company, in the release, there's a Q&A with some executives from the Venturing & Emerging Brands unit talking about how important it is for them to maintain that heritage and tradition for this brand, despite the fact that they're going to be putting it into the machine and expanding its presence across the country. We'll be watching to see what kind of success they have, whether this can be a next Honest Tea for them. But ultimately, this unit within Coca-Cola has invested in over something like 40 different brands at this point. Not every single one is going to be a major success, but if we know anything about this company, they certainly have the resources and the experience in beverages to experiment and test and find these small labels and help turn them into enormous successes. For our last story, it's yet another recent development from Wal-Mart. I know we've been hitting a lot of Wal-Mart coverage on the show lately, so I'll tentatively promise that this will be the last bit for the king of retail for at least a few weeks, if not a few months. But I won't deny that it's been pretty fascinating to follow along with the various experiments and new initiatives that Marc Lore has rolled out as the head of the company's e-commerce efforts. That's not to mention what Wal-Mart has done with the Jet.com business itself. The company actually announced this morning that it would be acquiring a small start-up called Parcel. What's the story here, Asit? Sharma: Parcel is, like you say, a small company that focuses on last mile and same day delivery in New York City. The transaction size was not disclosed, but it is said to be about $10 million. So you can imagine, this is a very tiny company. What would Wal-Mart want to do with a company that it can purchase for $10 million that's located in New York City of all places, a very dense city? The answer is that last-mile services are the hardest part of the logistics supply chain, the most expensive part pound-for-pound. Amazon.com, a fierce competitor to Wal-Mart, has partnered up with the United States Postal Service to solve last mile problems. But what's so interesting is, in New York City, there's a lot of opportunity for Jet.com to basically be a test kitchen for different ventures. And Parcel helps Jet.com, which Wal-Mart acquired, listeners will remember, for $3 billion. Parcel helps Jet.com test delivery services within dense populations like New York City. So we should talk about Uniquely J, which is Jet.com's answer to the Whole Foods-Amazon.com partnership. Uniquely J is a service developed by Jet.com to offer high-end food products and also products such as cleaning supplies, bath tissues, to customers for delivery, probably within that same two-hour window that Amazon.com promises. Parcel lets Jet.com make that last mile delivery, and it gives this experimental template for Wal-Mart to go into big cities where it doesn't necessarily want to put a Supercenter -- places like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago -- and have a supplemental business model while also trying to kick Amazon.com in the shins. Shen: I think this is where everything comes together. We have this small start-up logistics company to help organize same-day deliveries for New York City. It has some of the infrastructure, the staff, and experience in the city to ramp up the potential same-day shipping efforts for Jet.com and Wal-Mart.com in that market. At the same time, I believe that Parcel is already handling some of the deliveries, for example, for Bonobos, which also happened to be acquired by Wal-Mart earlier this year. And that becomes part of this overall plan where everything is starting to come together a little bit for the company's e-commerce efforts. They talk about the Bonobos and Modcloth acquisitions, these are men's and women's apparel companies. Now, Wal-Mart has recently announced that they intend to make both those brands available on Jet.com. So Jet.com previously having more of a discount reputation, they're starting to offer those two brands on there, raising the cachet, again, another time that we're using that, the brand premium that's associated with the site. And with Uniquely J, they've also mentioned that this private label Jet.com brand that's going to roll out with consumer staples in the next couple of months, they want it to target some of these urban-based millennials. So they'll get a similar theme here, because these Uniquely J products are supposed to be higher-end to appeal to that target market. Again, as you mentioned, this really follows closely on the heels of Amazon, which has made its 365 by Whole Foods products available online, and the initial reports for that said it was met with great success, a lot of items selling out very quickly. So we've spoken previously about the solid growth Wal-Mart is enjoying in its digital business. I ultimately believe this is still a marathon. These are all small moves on the chessboard for the company. Ultimately, Wal-Mart wants to widen its appeal with the help of Jet.com, and its reputation as a younger, cooler brand while establishing the necessary infrastructure and logistics it will need to provide greater convenience to customers in these various urban markets, obviously starting first with this one Parcel deal right in New York City. Any other takeaways for you, Asit, in terms of what this spells for the future, in terms of this arms race between the big retailers? Sharma: Sure, one last point. And by the way, what a great example, because these are two grand masters that are playing a very long game of chess. I was really intrigued by this acquisition, because Wal-Mart is taking such a different approach than Amazon. Everyone knows Amazon builds fulfillment centers every year all across the U.S. from the ground up, supplies them with amazing automation and technology. Wal-Mart is picking up on something that I was actually reading about in Supply Chain Newsletter several months ago, that there's a ton of warehouse space in cities like New York, in Brooklyn, where I believe Parcel is based, in Chicago, in almost any big city you can think of. You've seen how urban drift has created this. It's space that's unleased, perfectly usable, and very capital-lite for a company like Wal-Mart. So it's developing a model where it can have its own quasi-fulfillment centers which are just in big cities to deliver that last mile much more cheaply than if it tried to compete with Amazon and think of itself as a company that's going to build a bunch of its own fulfillment centers. Of course, Wal-Mart thinks that its super stores themselves are quasi-fulfillment centers, and they have a point, because they're so large. But I'm intrigued from the real estate aspect of this. Again, if this is a chess move, to me, this is equal to a threat on the chessboard. It's like calling check, and the other opponent over time is going to have to make sure that his king is well-protected. So we'll follow that as well.

247,Robert Schroeder,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 12, 2017 12:10 p.m. ET President promises ‘great, great’ health care in White House ceremony By President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to consider expanding health-insurance coverage in low-cost plans that are not subject to Affordable Care Act rules, a move that could raise costs for sicker people. The order is designed to provide what the White House calls “alternatives” to plans offered through Obamacare markets. It comes after the implosion last month of Republicans’ latest attempt to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law, a chief policy goal that Trump and GOP lawmakers campaigned on. See:  Senate Republicans junk last-gasp effort to kill Obamacare. Speaking before signing the order at a White House ceremony, Trump said consumers “will have so many options.” “People will have great, great health care,” he added. Trump also ordered the labor secretary to consider expanding consumers’ access to so-called association health plans. Those plans could allow employers to form groups across state lines, and allow access to more plans and lower rates, the White House says. The order does not, however, allow such plans to market directly to individuals. While the order stops short of dismantling Obamacare, health-insurance experts worry about the effect it could have on coverage. They say it could raise costs for the sick by drawing healthier and younger Americans to alternative plans, which could be less expensive. States currently regulate health plans within their borders. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has said interstate sales “will start a race to the bottom by allowing companies to choose their regulator.” Trump was joined at the event by Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, who said the order would allow “millions of people” to buy insurance across state lines. Market reaction to the news was muted.

                                   Let’s explore that investment starting with a chart. Chart Please click here for a larger annotated chart of Intel’s stock. Please note the following from the chart: • This is a weekly chart and, thus, is of more value in analyzing a breakout. • The price of Intel is breaking out. • The breakout is from a so-called triple top. • Breakouts from a triple top tend to have a higher probability of being successful. • The RSI (relative strength index) is barely overbought and shows that there is significantly more room to run. • The breakout is on low volume. This is negative and poses risks for those buying at current levels. Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora. Why the breakout now? The gurus are out in full force regurgitating the old news as a reason for the breakout. My 30-plus years of experience in the markets has shown that breakouts are seldom caused by stale news. The real reason for the breakout is that many risk-averse investors are searching for cheap stocks that are also laggards. Intel fits the bill on both counts. At least in theory, there is less risk in buying Intel today than a high-flying competitor. Here’s how Intel has fared over the past month compared with its Dow rivals: Further, a significant amount of money is tied to so-called quant strategies. Many quant strategies — based on computer models — work on mean reversion. Managers with such strategies are buyers of Intel at this time. In plain English, it means that stocks that have not risen with the broader market are now likely to increase. The strong group Intel is the largest U.S. semiconductor company. The semiconductor group, as represented by semiconductor ETF

Dividend and valuation The dividend and valuation will provide support in case there is a market decline. Intel’s dividend yield is 2.86%. Intel also has a much cheaper valuation than its competitors. Achilles heel Intel’s Achilles heel has been its reliance on PCs. Personal computers have been in a long decline. This is the reason the stock has lagged not only the broader market, as represented by the popular S&P 500 ETF

                                   are working on artificial intelligence. Even though Intel is behind, it is likely to find plenty of opportunities. Intel recently unveiled an artificial-intelligence chip called Loihi that mimics the human brain using an old neuromorphic technology. This technology uses spiking neurons as the basic computing unit instead of the logic gates that are used in conventional processors Altera acquisition Intel acquired Altera, a maker of programmable logic chips, in 2015. These chips have applications in all sorts of industries, ranging from automotive to telecommunications. In the future, this acquisition may give Intel an edge in artificial intelligence. Mobileye acquisition Intel recently purchased Mobileye, a maker of systems for autonomous cars. This gives Intel a foothold in an important growth area. Price target and how to buy it The Arora Report’s long-term target on Intel is $56 to $58. If Intel’s stock rises, it may see profit-taking in the zone of $42 to $44, and then around $50. In recognition that all investors are different, at The Arora Report we provide guidance on different ways of investing. Those buying today may note that the breakout is on a low volume and October tends to be a volatile month. So those buying now may want to scale in. And those who are more conservative may wait for a pullback into the buy zone of $35 to $37.63. There is a 70% probability of a pullback into this zone in the next 120 days.

After a House vote, the Senate approved a budget bill on Thursday. Republicans passed tax cuts through what is known as budget reconciliation, which requires just a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate with 52 seats. A persistent uptrend for stocks have been partially underpinned by the hope of tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, with a likelihood of the passage of a pro-business tax policy often propelling buying in assets perceived as risky. What are strategists saying? • “Up until a week ago there has been a lot of pessimism among investors that the Trump administration cannot pass any tax reforms, especially after the failure to repeal the [Affordable Healthcare Act]. But that seems to have changed last week, when the [Big Six] outlined their tax plan and more people now believe companies’ earnings will be boosted by lower tax rates,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated investors. The so-called Big Six includes the leaders of the House and Senate, national economic director Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. • “The path of least resistance for markets seems to be higher. Revisions on the earnings front have been positive, the global growth theme is continuing, and I think valuations are fine, given where we are in terms of inflation,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. “There are no classic signs of exuberance that would derail the market’s trajectory, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see multiples and earnings go higher, absent some crazy macro shock that no one can forecast.” See: Some investors see signs stock market ‘on verge’ of a melt-up Which stocks are in focus?

Section 201 “provides that if the U.S. International Trade Commission (the Commission) determines that an article is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article,” the president can take action to address the imbalance, the USITC said in a statement. The commission launched an investigation of the issue in June that resulted in a 4-0 vote. The USITC will hold a public hearing on Oct. 19 and will present a report to President Donald Trump by December 4. Trump will be responsible for the final decision on whether to offer relief to the U.S. industry and what kind of relief may be offered. The commission will consider recommending such moves as an increase in a duty, a quota, a tariff-rate quote, trade adjustment assistance or any combination of the above. Whirlpool welcomed the vote and said it’s an important win for American manufacturers and American workers. “For the third time since 2013, the ITC has found that Samsung and LG engaged in unlawful conduct by violating U.S. trade laws,” Chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. “This vote sets the stage for the administration to put in place an effective remedy to create a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers. This type of corrective action will create U.S. manufacturing jobs.” Read also: Like Amazon, these seven stocks have dropped 10% or more in a month — and analysts say buy them too Whirlpool has criticized the South Korean companies for operating “screwdriver operations,” or plants that assemble major parts that are brought in from overseas for final assembly, instead of investing the money needed to operate full manufacturing facilities. Samsung said it was disappointed with the decision and that it would hurt American consumers by limiting their choices, raising prices and offering less innovation in washing machines. “We remain committed to establishing our North American home appliance manufacturing facility in South Carolina and to delivering the most innovative washing machines, made by Americans, and sold to American consumers,” the company said in a statement. “We urge the Commission to consider carefully how potential remedies might hinder the establishment and operations of this facility and affect American consumers.” See:  Sears to sell Kenmore brand on Amazon In its most recent quarter, Whirlpool had sales of $5.348 billion, up from $5.198 billion in the year-earlier period.

251,Tony Robbins,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 11, 2017 10:35 a.m. ET Take charge of your money before giving it to a professional manager By This is the first of a series of articles from life- and business strategist Tony Robbins on sharpening your investing and personal-finance skills. Doctors, lawyers, and certified public accountants in the United States are legally required to act in the best interests of the people they serve. Yet financial advisers get a free pass. There are more than 200 different designations for financial advisers, including “financial consultants,” “wealth managers,” “financial advisers,” “investment consultants,” “wealth advisers,” and — in case that doesn’t sound exclusive enough — “private wealth advisers.” But the reality is, of the roughly 310,000 financial advisers in the U.S., less than 10% are legally obligated to put your interests first at all times on all of your accounts. These are called “registered investment advisers” or RIAs for short. RIAs don’t accept sales commissions. Instead, they typically charge a flat fee or a percentage of your total assets for unbiased financial advice. It’s a cleaner model that removes awkward conflicts of interest and hidden agendas. As for the other 90%, they’re simply brokers in disguise. Many of them work for enormous Wall Street banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies — the kind that splash their names on sports arenas. Why does this matter? Because brokers have a vested interest in hawking expensive products, which might include actively managed mutual funds, whole-life insurance policies, variable annuities, and “wrap” accounts. Don’t get me wrong, this is not an indictment on the good people that work in the industry. I have lots of friends and clients in the financial industry, so I’m speaking with firsthand knowledge when I tell you that they — and the vast majority of their colleagues — are people of real integrity. They have good hearts and good intentions. The trouble is, they work in a system that’s beyond their control — a system that has tremendously powerful financial incentives to focus on maximizing profits above all else. This is a system that richly rewards employees who put their employer’s interests first, their own interests second, and their clients’ interests a distant third. Even the best-intentioned financial advisers are often working within the confines of this system. They’re under intense pressure to grow profits, and they’re rewarded for doing so. If you — the client — happen to do well, too, that’s great. But don’t kid yourself. You’re not the priority. And for folks like you and me, that’s a recipe for disaster — unless we take the precaution of learning how the system works against us, and how to counter it. How do you start? By making sure to ask these seven questions of a financial adviser, or any adviser, you are considering: 1. Are you a registered investment adviser? If the answer is no, this adviser is a broker. Smile sweetly and say good-bye. If the answer is yes, he or she is required by law to be a fiduciary. But you still need to figure out if this fiduciary is wearing one hat or two. That’s because Its not enough that your financial adviser is an independent RIA. You need to be careful that the RIA is not also a broker. You heard that right. In a strangely allowable arrangement, an RIA can be both a broker and a fiduciary in a process called “dual registration.” When someone is “dually registered,” at one moment they play the part of an unbiased adviser, reassuring you that they abide by the fiduciary standard and can provide you with conflict-free advice for a fee. But they can switch hats and act as a broker, earning commissions or kickbacks by selling you specific products. When they’re playing this broker role, they no longer have to abide by the fiduciary standard. In other words, they’re sometimes obliged to serve your best interests and sometimes not. How warped is that? These arrangements are perhaps the most dangerous for consumers as it creates immense confusion. 2. Are you or your firm affiliated with a broker-dealer? If the answer is yes, you’re dealing with someone who can act as a broker and usually has an incentive to steer you to specific investments. One easy way to figure this out is to glance at the bottom of the adviser’s website or business card and see if there’s a sentence like this: “Securities offered through [adviser’s company name], member FINRA and SIPC.” This refers to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, respectively. If you see these words, it means he or she can act as a broker. If so, run. Run for your life! 3. Does your firm offer proprietary mutual funds or separately managed accounts? You want the answer to be an emphatic “no.” If the answer is yes, then watch your wallet. It probably means they’re looking to generate additional revenues by steering you into these products that are highly profitable for them (but probably not for you). 4. Do you or your firm receive any third-party compensation for recommending particular investments? This is the ultimate question you want answered. Why? Because you need to know that your adviser has no incentive to recommend products that will shower him or her with commissions, kickbacks, consulting fees, trips, or other goodies. 5. What’s your philosophy when it comes to investing? This will help you to understand whether or not the adviser believes that he or she can beat the market by picking individual stocks or actively managed funds. 6. What financial planning services do you offer beyond investment strategy and portfolio management? Investment help may be all you need, depending on your stage of life. But as you grow older and/or you become more wealthy with various holdings to manage, things often become more complex financially. For example, you may need to deal with saving for a child’s college education, retirement planning, handling your vested stock options, or estate planning. Most advisers have limited capabilities once they venture beyond investing. In fact, most aren’t legally allowed to offer tax advice due to their broker status. Ideally you want an adviser who can bring tools for tax efficiency in all aspects of your planning — from investment planning to business planning to estate planning. 7. Where will my money be held? A fiduciary adviser should always use a third-party custodian to hold your funds. For example, Fidelity, Schwab, and TD Ameritrade all have custodial arms that will keep your money in a secure environment. You then sign a limited power of attorney that gives the adviser the right to manage the money but never to make withdrawals. The good news about this arrangement is that if you ever want to fire your adviser, you don’t have to move your accounts. You can simply hire a new adviser who can take over managing your accounts without missing a beat. This custodial system also protects you from the danger of getting fleeced by a con man like Bernie Madoff. Tony Robbins is a life- and business strategist and author.

252,Jillian Berman,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 11, 2017 2:33 p.m. ET Many Latino students who go to college attend the open-access colleges white students are fleeing By The fastest-growing group of workers is being held back by our higher education system. Between 1992 and 2016, the share of the population made up by Latinos grew by 9%, but the share of Latinos with at least some kind of college education grew by just 6% during that same period, according to an analysis published Wednesday by Georgetown University’s Center for Education and the Workforce. Latinos make up a smaller share of workers with good jobs — or jobs that pay a decent salary and have health insurance — that require a bachelor’s degree than they did in 1991, the report notes. What’s more, other demographic groups are seeing faster progress, which means Latinos are losing ground. In this way, Latinos have “essentially stalled” when it comes to obtaining higher education and landing their share of jobs that come with it, said Anthony Carnevale, the director of the Georgetown Center. And qualified Latino students who do enroll in higher education, are more likely to end up in schools where they may struggle to graduate or find a decent job. Each year, 125,000 Latino high school students earn test scores that would put them in the top half of the nation’s students. But just 26,000 enroll in one of the 500 most selective colleges in the country, according to the report. Instead, 65% of Latino students who go to college attend the open-access colleges white students are fleeing; white enrollment at these schools has dropped 18% since 2004, the report adds. Latino students “are largely consigned to the lower, crowded and underfunded two-year and four-year parts of the system,” Carnevale said. “That has real implications for their graduation and success.” “There’s a general presumption in the United States almost always with respect to new groups, especially immigrant groups, that it’s okay if people are behind, so long as they’re always getting better off, so long as there’s progress,” Carnevale said. “What this report shows is that that’s not really true for Hispanics. The presumption that they’re making steady progress is way overstated.” There are a variety of factors undermining their progress, Carnevale noted. For one, Latinos are poised to go to college in larger numbers at a time when college is expensive. Students are also increasingly relying on a combination of work and loans to pay for school. These trends are in part a result of decreased investment from state and local governments in higher education. Contrast that with white Americans who began going to college in large numbers for the first time when the GI bill became available, helping them pay for school. “They’ve got to make a very fast transition” from relying on decent-paying blue-collar jobs, which are shrinking, Carnevale said of Latino students. “The current state of higher education is not friendly to that. It’s very selective, high priced and offers very little support.” Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has knifed to the 2,550 technical target, punctuating a steep October breakout. The initial pullback has been distinctly flat. Tactically, near-term support (2,540) is followed by an inflection point matching the third-quarter close of 2,519. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sustained a break to record territory. Here again, near-term support remains poorly-defined, though inflection points are illustrated. The Dow’s first notable floor matches the breakout point, circa 22,420, also illustrated on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has snapped a stretch of six straight record closes. Though still near-term extended, and due to consolidate, Monday’s 10-point downturn barely registers. The Nasdaq’s first notable floor broadly spans from 6,460 to 6,477, matching the breakout point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months, the Nasdaq has confirmed its primary uptrend. The prevailing breakout originates from a tight September range, underpinned by major support at 6,342. The late-September low registered less than two points higher. To reiterate, the 6,460 breakout point matches the first notable floor against the current backdrop. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has taken flight. The October breakout punctuates a flag pattern pinned to the early-September rally. Separately, consider that the 50-day moving average, currently 22,130, has risen to match the September breakout point, technically 22,118. The prevailing leg higher originates from three successful retests of the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has also refused to materially pull in. Consider that its closing high of 2,552 matches the projected target, technically 2,551. (Take the July peak minus the August low: 2,484 - 2,417 = 67 points. Then, add to the breakout point: 2,484 + 67 = 2,551.) Separately, the S&P’s 50-day moving average, currently 2,483, closely matches the September breakout point. Broadly speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a strong fourth-quarter start. Each index has confirmed its primary uptrend as the October earnings season approaches, and amid recently hawkish-leaning Federal Reserve policy language. Against this backdrop, the small-caps have recently staged the bull trend’s headline technical event.

                                   chart includes the 20-day Bollinger bands, also known as volatility bands. Those bands, illustrated in red, encompass two standard deviations of the small-cap benchmark’s 20-day volatility. As always, consecutive closes atop the bands signal a tension between two time horizons. Though near-term overbought, and due to consolidate, bullish momentum has been statistically unusual, improving the chances of longer-term follow-through higher. In the present case, the small-cap benchmark’s breakout encompassed three closes higher across a four-session window. Bullish price action. Tactically, near-term support (147.44) is followed by the firmer breakout point, circa 145.25. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has also broken out, though slightly less decisively. Its October breakout included a lone close atop the 20-day Bollinger bands (not illustrated). More broadly, the mid-cap benchmark’s prevailing leg higher builds on the late-2016 rally, illustrated on the three-year chart. All told, the U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend continues to defy seasonal tendencies. A grinding-higher summer rally has been punctuated by consecutive September and October technical breakouts. Moreover, the October rally has been statistically unusual in spots, though in different spots than the strong early-September breakout. More plainly, the technical backdrop remains rotational, and the bull trend firmly-grounded. As it applies to the S&P 500, the index has reached the 2,550 target and a consolidation phase is underway. Tactically, near-term support (2,508) is followed by a firmer floor (2,480) closely matching the 50-day moving average. The S&P’s intermediate-term uptrend is firmly intact barring a violation.

254,Alessandra Malito,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Published: Oct 6, 2017 2:47 p.m. ET The Great American Beer Festival takes place this weekend By Don’t put down your Oktoberfest stein just yet. The Great American Beer Festival in Denver is just getting started. Fans of the beverage, rejoice: Beer may have a bad reputation for its empty calories and the “beer bellies” but, some research suggests, it could have some health benefits. For 35 years, Americans have been celebrating beer at the festival. The event has unlimited one-ounce tastings of more than 3,500 beers, plus competitions between some 800 breweries. Also see:  How everything changed for a craft beer brewer after it sold itself to MillerCoors How could beer actually be good for you? Beer could lower the risk of diabetes, according to a Danish study published this week in the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Among 70,000 people, including both drinkers and non-drinkers, the lowest risk of diabetes was in the group of men who had 14 drinks a week and women who had nine drinks a week. “Moderate drinking is key here,” said Michelle Dudash, a registered dietitian and author of “Clean Eating for Busy Families.” Like wine, it does not contain any added sugar once it’s fermented. Cocktails, on the other hand, are often made with sugary ingredients like simple syrups, Dudash said. There are also a lot of light beers on the market now with half the calories, Dudash said. People should watch the alcohol content of beers, which could alter the number of beers they should be drinking, since a higher percentage in alcohol content means they should have fewer beers. The average is 5%, so drinking a beer with 7% alcohol content would be the equivalent of 1.4 beers, Dudash said. Also see: This is what Guinness is doing to sell more stout Drinking beer can promote heart health, similarly to wine, a 2016 study Penn State University found. Moderate drinkers — one to two drinks a day for men, and a half to one drink a day for women — saw the slowest decline in “good” cholesterol levels (also known as high-density lipoprotein), more so for those who opted for beer over hard liquor with beer drinkers experiencing better outcomes than people who drink hard liquor. That means a lower chance of cardiovascular diseases. The study tracked cholesterol levels in 80,000 participants for six years. Increased levels of high-density lipoprotein keep “bad” cholesterol from blocking arteries, according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Training Center. Beer contains about 12% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin B6, Dudash said, though people with alcohol dependency tend to have lower levels of the vitamin.

Beer contains about 12% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin B6, Dudash said, though people with alcohol dependency tend to have lower levels of the vitamin. The myth of the beer belly There’s actually no hard evidence to suggest a person’s gut comes from consuming a lot of beer, studies claim. That’s good news for those celebrating at the Great American Beer Festival, which runs from Oct. 5 to 7 and is hosted by the Brewers Association, a non-profit trade organization. Drinking a lot of the beverage can increase calorie intake and prevent fat burning, and beer does contain phytoestrogens, which can cause hormonal changes in men that make them more prone to storing belly fat. But again, it comes down to moderation, studies show. One study, published in 2007, men who consumed more than three drinks a day were 80% more likely to have more belly fat than those who didn’t consume as much, but that’s also more than the two drink per day limit for men that other studies suggest is a moderate level of drinking. Also see: Americans are buying beer and a beach vacation at the same time But drinking beer clearly has it’s downsides, right? Just because some beers have lower calories than others, and no added sugars, doesn’t mean guzzling a cold pilsner is the same as eating a kale salad, Dudash said. “I wouldn’t consider it a nutrient-rich food,” she said. What really causes a “beer belly” is too many calories, from any source, including alcohol, sugary beverages and oversized portions of food, according to medical reference site WebMD. Fat is usually stored and seen in men’s stomachs, while for women, it tends to be around the hips, Dudash said. Beers have also been linked to certain cancers when heavily consumed: More than seven beers a week for women and more than 14 beers a week for men. Cancers linked to all alcohol use include mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, liver, colon and rectum and breast, according to the American Cancer Society. People’s taste for beer has also waned or, at least, changed. They want weaker, lower-alcohol content beers, as sales of wines and spirits are on the rise.

255, ,10122017,MarketWatch,10052017,"Keep Me Logged In U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after data showed the labor market experienced its first contraction in seven years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.72 points to close at 22,773.67, with Chevron and Boeing contributing the most to the losses. The index also snapped a seven-day winning streak. The S&P 500 declined 0.1 percent to 2,549.33, with consumer staples and telecommunications leading decliners. The index also snapped an eight-day winning streak — its longest in four years — and also ended a streak of six straigh record closes, the longest such streak since 1997. The Nasdaq composite eked out a record high, rising 0.07 percent to 6,590.18. The U.S. lost 33,000 jobs September due in large part to two major hurricanes hitting the country. Last month markets the first time the U.S. labor market contracted since 2010. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 90,000 jobs. Despite the weak headline number, average hourly earnings rose to an annualized rate of 2.9 percent. Hourly earnings are closely watched by investors looking for indications on inflation. The unemployment rate also fell to a 16-year low of 4.2 percent. ""Trying to guess the headline number on this one was a fool's game,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. The report ""looks pretty sloppy from the top, but there's more good news than bad."" Treasury yields jumped after the report's release. The benchmark 10-year yield advanced to 2.362 percent, while the two-year yield rose to 1.51 percent, notching its highest level since 2008. ""Everyone knew the report would be confusing because of the distortions from [hurricanes] Harvey and Irma,"" said Richard Piccirillo, managing director at PGIM Fixed Income. ""But despite the distortions, average hourly earnings went down and unemployment went down. I think the bond market is reacting a bit to that."" The strong wages data also increases the chances of a Federal Reserve rate hike by December, according to Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. ""Over the past few months, they've reopened the path for another rate hike,"" he said. From before the central bank's previous meeting [to today], the odds of a rate hike have risen from about 30 percent to 80 percent."" Stocks were coming off yet another record-setting session. The S&P 500 posted its sixth straight all-time closing high on Thursday, marking its longest streak of record closes since 1997. The Dow and Nasdaq also notched record highs. The major indexes also posted strong weekly gains, rising more than 1 percent. Sentiment on Wall Street has been lifted lately by strong economic data and renewed hope of tax reform. The ISM manufacturing and nonmanufacturing numbers released earlier this week hit multi-year highs. Meanwhile, the House passed a $4.1 trillion budget on Thursday, which marked the first concrete step toward enacting tax reform.""We've seen this reflation trade and that's correlated with tax reform,"" said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.

257,,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, said earnings will grow 13 to 16 percent in 2018 as medical costs remain low, and that it expects to benefit from new insurance products backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. UnitedHealth, the industry bellwether, is the first health insurer to report and its third-quarter net earnings rose 26.3 percent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares rose more than 5 percent, also lifting rival insurers such as Anthem Inc, Aetna Inc, and Cigna Corp. Trump, who promised to repeal predecessor Barack Obama’s signature the Affordable Care Act - so-called Obamacare - but failed to do so, last week signed an executive order to weaken it. UnitedHealth sold Obamacare individual plans in about two dozen states before booking financial losses and then mostly pulling out of the market this year. UnitedHealth’s new Chief Executive Dave Wichmann now sees opportunities in the plans outlined by Trump. Those plans envision the creation of more associations that will allow people to band together to buy cheaper, less regulated health plans, and extends the duration of benefit-light short-term plans to one year from three months. Wichmann said the company would work with the administration on the new products it had outlined, and that it already has 300,000 customers in association health plans. “We have a great deal of experience in the areas covered in the first order — short-term policies, association plans and expanded use of HRAs,” Wichmann said on a conference call, referring to taxfree employer-funded health reimbursement accounts. While it could take until 2019 until association plans are for sale, the short-term plan extension may come sooner. Wichmann also said the impact of Trump’s decision to scrap about $7 billion in subsidies paid to health insurance companies for low-income patients would be “extremely small”. The company only has about 30,000 customers who are eligible for these subsidies in four states. Boosting growth next year, the company also expects to increase the number of insurance customers and grow its Optum pharmacy and data businesses, adding to the benefits of its medical costs remaining within a targeted range. Wichmann said the 2018 outlook takes into account the reinstatement of Obamacare’s 3 percent tax on health insurance, putting the cost at about 75 cents in earnings per share growth. The tax was suspended in 2017 and will be back in effect after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. UnitedHealth said net earnings rose 26.3 percent to $2.49 billion, or $2.51 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Excluding items, the company earned $2.66 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

258,,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government dropped a lawsuit accusing UnitedHealth Group Inc of submitting false claims to get inflated Medicare payouts, a court filing on Thursday showed, a week after a judge dismissed the complaint but said it could be amended. U.S. District Judge John Walter in Los Angeles ruled that the lawsuit failed to identify any UnitedHealth officers who signed documents vouching for data submitted to the Medicare Advantage program, or to claim that any of them knew they were signing off on false information. “We are pleased with the government’s decision to dismiss these meritless claims,” said UnitedHealth spokesman Matt Burns in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice, which filed the lawsuit, declined to comment. A second lawsuit by the government, accusing UnitedHealth of obtaining over $1 billion of Medicare payouts it was not entitled to, remains pending. Medicare Advantage, an alternative to the standard fee-for-service Medicare in which private insurers manage health benefits, is the fastest growing form of government health insurance, with enrollment of 18 million people last year. The dismissed lawsuit said that since at least 2005, UnitedHealth knew many of the diagnosis codes it submitted to the Medicare program for increased payments, based on “risk” factors like health status, were not supported by patients’ medical records. But the company turned a blind eye, the lawsuit said, funding and encouraging one-sided chart reviews of patients of HealthCare Partners, which provided services to UnitedHealth beneficiaries in California. As a result, UnitedHealth was able to wrongfully retain risk adjustment payments it received from the government, the lawsuit said. The Department of Justice filed the lawsuit in May after it partially intervened in a whistleblower lawsuit brought by James Swoben, a former employee of Senior Care Action Network Health Plan and a consultant to the risk adjustment industry. The case is U.S. ex rel Swoben v. Scan Health Plan et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 09-cv-05013. ","

259,,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan deal from two senators to stabilize Obamacare by restoring subsidies to health insurers suffered major setbacks on Wednesday with the White House saying President Donald Trump now opposes it and senior Republicans speaking out against it. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, Senate Republican leadership member John Thune and others expressed hostility to the deal announced on Tuesday by Republican Lamar Alexander and Democrat Patty Murray. It was uncertain if it would ever come to a vote in a Congress controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. The agreement would shore up Obamacare by reviving billions of dollars of federal subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Alexander said on Wednesday that Trump had “completely engineered” the bipartisan proposal, but the president backed away from support he had expressed a day earlier. On Tuesday, Trump said the White House was involved in the negotiations and that the agreement was “a very good solution” for a short-term approach, but said on Wednesday he could “never support bailing out” insurance companies. Trump has cut off subsidies to the companies, saying Congress has not provided money for them and that they enrich insurers. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump did not support the deal in its current form, although she called it “a good step in the right direction.” “Look, we’ve said all along that we want something that doesn’t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans,” she said at a briefing. “And this bill doesn’t address that fact.” The confusion among lawmakers in both parties over Trump’s position on the healthcare deal and the lack of trust some of them have in the president come as Congress is entering a crucial period when important bills on federal spending, the U.S. debt limit and tax cuts are due for consideration. Thune said the agreement might have “stalled out” and that its future was an “open question.” Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority, but other than Alexander only a few have publicly embraced the plan, including Senators John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mike Rounds and Bob Corker. “No way to pay for it,” Hatch said. “Oh my gosh, give me a break. I appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right. But it doesn’t help.” Trump, who campaigned on a promise to get rid of Obamacare but has been frustrated by the failure of Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to do so, also made clear he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace the law. “Lamar Alexander’s working on it very hard from our side. And if something can happen, that’s fine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I won’t do anything to enrich the insurance companies. ... They’ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody’s ever seen before.” Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement dubbed Obamacare, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people. Ending the subsidies, which are called cost-sharing reduction payments, could create chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare. Some leading insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have largely exited those markets, citing financial losses. Others including Anthem Inc have significantly reduced their presence in the state-based markets. Ryan gave no indication of willingness to consider the Alexander-Murray agreement. “The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said. The proposal drew broad Democratic support. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer ripped Trump for his shifting stances on the Alexander-Murray deal. “This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says: ‘Jump,’ he says: “How high?’” Schumer told reporters. “The president is pointing fingers,” Schumer said. “He blames (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell for obstruction. He blames the Democrats for obstruction. He’s the obstructionist in chief because he cannot stick to a position.” The proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans. In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage. Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia who have filed a legal challenge to the subsidy cutoff asked a judge in California to direct the administration by Thursday to continue the payments. At a hearing on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said he would likely rule on the states’ request next week. Murray, speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, said her agreement with Alexander was still very much alive. “Absolutely,” Murray said. “Lamar and I are working to have a good set of co-sponsors,” and hope to formally introduce it as a Senate bill on Thursday.

261, ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(Reuters) - Health insurer Anthem Inc will start managing its billions of dollars of patient prescriptions itself in 2020, it said on Wednesday, ending a deal with Express Scripts Holding Co  that had deteriorated into lawsuits over terms. Anthem said it would save $4 billion annually in the new contract with drug retailer CVS Health Corp, which will handle prescription fulfillment and claims processing starting in 2020 for five years for the new company, called IngenioRX. Anthem said it would pass on 80 percent of those savings to customers in pricing and 20 percent to the bottom line, boosting earnings by $2 per share starting in 2021. Anthem shares rose 3.1 percent, or $5.93, to $193 in Wednesday afternoon trading, while CVS shares were up 2.3 percent at $74.31. The new structure gives Anthem more control to lower healthcare costs, expand contracting with doctors and hospitals based on health outcomes and work on lowering annual increases in medical costs, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in an interview. Anthem had considered exiting the Express Scripts deal for several years and sued the pharmacy benefit manager in 2016 over claims of being overcharged by $3 billion annually. Express Scripts has countersued and denied allegations of overcharging. Pharmacy benefit managers negotiate prices with drugmakers and determine which treatments are included on their list of covered drugs and how much of a co-payment to charge for them versus their rivals. As drug prices have posted annual double-digit gains, companies, insurers and the U.S. government have pushed benefit managers to better manage costs. Lawmakers have criticized the companies for not being “transparent” about drug prices and questioned whether any savings make it to their customers and consumers. Swedish said that with the pharmacy function run by Anthem, it would be able to provide that information to customers. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte estimated that No.2 health insurer Anthem’s prescription business represents about 220 million scripts per year worth about $23 billion in revenue. Other insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc, already manage their pharmacy benefits themselves. Anthem, whose 10-year contract with Express Scripts expires in 2019, had said it was considering staying with Express Scripts, choosing another company, or doing the work itself. Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the company was disappointed by the move and would continue to work with Anthem through the contract end date and any transition period. Excluding Anthem, the company has 65 million members, he said. Express Scripts’ shares rose 2.3 percent. CVS Health, which also has a pharmacy benefit management business in addition to its pharmacies and Minute Clinics, said it expects to incur implementation charges related to the Anthem deal, but that the costs would not have an impact on its 2017 earnings.

262, ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"DECISION TIME: The European Union is considering whether to allow the continued use of the weedkiller glyphosate. France has said it would like to phase it out. Some farmers say such a move would damage their business. Above, a French farmer harvests wheat in a field in northern France. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol When the International Agency for Research on Cancer assessed the best-selling weedkiller glyphosate, significant changes were made between a draft of its report and the published version. The agency won't say who made the changes or why. By  Kate Kelland Filed Oct. 19, 2017, 3:30 p.m. GMT LONDON â The World Health Organization's cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of the weedkiller glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer. Documents seen by Reuters show how a draft of a key section of the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) assessment of glyphosate - a report that has prompted international disputes and multi-million-dollar lawsuits - underwent significant changes and deletions before the report was finalised and made public. IARC, based in Lyon, France, wields huge influence as a semi-autonomous unit of the WHO, the United Nations health agency. It issued a report on its assessment of glyphosate - a key ingredient in Monsanto Corp's top-selling weedkiller RoundUp - in March 2015. It ranked glyphosate a Group 2a carcinogen, a substance that probably causes cancer in people. Related content Special Report: The WHOâs cancer agency left in the dark over glyphosate evidence WHO cancer agency asked experts to withold weedkiller documents That conclusion was based on its expertsâ view that there was âsufficient evidence"" glyphosate causes cancer in animals and ""limited evidence"" it can do so in humans. The Group 2a classification has prompted mass litigation in the United States against Monsanto and could lead to a ban on glyphosate sales across the European Union from the start of next year. The edits identified by Reuters occurred in the chapter of IARCâs review focusing on animal studies. This chapter was important in IARCâs assessment of glyphosate, since it was in animal studies that IARC decided there was âsufficientâ evidence of carcinogenicity.Â One effect of the changes to the draft, reviewed by Reuters in a comparison with the published report, was the removal of multiple scientists' conclusions that their studies had found no link between glyphosate and cancer in laboratory animals. In one instance, a fresh statistical analysis was inserted - effectively reversing the original finding of a study being reviewed by IARC. In another, a sentence in the draft referenced a pathology report ordered by experts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It noted the report âfirmlyâ and âunanimouslyâ agreed that the âcompoundâ â glyphosate â had not caused abnormal growths in the mice being studied. In the final published IARC monograph, this sentence had been deleted. Reuters found 10 significant changes that were made between the draft chapter on animal studiesÂ and the published version of IARCâs glyphosate assessment. In each case, a negative conclusion about glyphosate leading to tumours was either deleted or replaced with a neutral or positive one. Reuters was unable to determine who made the changes. IARC did not respond to questions about the alterations. It said the draft was âconfidentialâ and âdeliberative in nature.â After Reuters asked about the changes, the agency posted a statement on its website advising the scientists who participate in its working groups ânot to feel pressured to discuss their deliberationsâ outside the confines of IARC. Reuters contacted 16 scientists who served in the IARC expert working group that conducted the weedkiller review to ask them about the edits and deletions. Most did not respond; five said they could not answer questions about the draft; none was willing or able to say who made the changes, or why or when they were made. The chairman of the IARC sub-groupÂ tasked with reviewing evidence of glyphosateâs effect on laboratory animals was Charles Jameson, an American toxicologist. In testimonyÂ as part of personal-injury lawsuits against Monsanto in the United States, Jameson told lawyers for Monsanto he did not know when, why or by whom the edits had been made. Monsanto is facing multiple legal claims in the U.S. from plaintiffs who allege glyphosate gave them or their loved ones cancer. Jameson is an expert witness for the plaintiffs. He did not respond to questions for this article. Scott Partridge, Monsantoâs vice president of global strategy, told Reuters the changes to the draft showed how âIARC members manipulated and distorted scientific dataâ in their glyphosate assessment. IARC declined to comment. âIARC would like to reiterate that draft versions of the Monographs are deliberative in nature and confidential.â Numerous national and international agencies have reviewed glyphosate. IARC is the only one to have declared the substance a probable carcinogen. Compared with other agencies, IARC has divulged little about its review process. Until now, it has been nearly impossible to see details, such as draft documents, of how IARC arrived at its decision. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said that in its assessment of the weedkiller, the scientific decision-making process âcan be traced from start to finish.â Jose Tarazona, head of EFSAâs pesticides unit, told Reuters: âAnyone can go to EFSAâs website and review how the assessment evolved over time. So you can see clearly how experts â¦ appraised each and every study and also how comments from the public consultation were incorporated into the scientific thinking.â In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency published a full 1,261-page transcript of a three-day scientific advisory panel meeting on its ongoing evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate in December 2016. No such record of the deliberations behind IARCâs monographs is published.In a previous response to questions about the transparency of the IARC process, the agencyâs director, Chris Wild, referred Reuters to a letter in which he said his agencyâs assessments are âwidely respected for their scientific rigour, standardised and transparent process.â Wild also said IARCâs methods are intended to allow scientists to engage in free scientific debate at its monograph meetings. DELETIONS AND ADDITIONS IARC says its working group scientists are selected for âtheir expertise and the absence of real or apparent conflicts of interest."" For the panel that evaluated glyphosate and four other pesticides in what is known as IARCâs Monograph 112, scientists from 11 countries met at the agencyâs headquarters in Lyon for a week-long meeting starting on March 3, 2015. The meeting ""followed nearly a year of review and preparationâ by IARC staff and working group members, âincluding a comprehensive review of the latest available scientific evidence,"" IARC said in a statement at the time. In June, Reuters reported how the chairman of the IARC working group was aware of new data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer in humans, but the agency did not take it into account because it had not been published. No drafts of IARCâs glyphosate assessment have surfaced before. However, a draft was obtained by Monsanto as part of the legal proceedings in the United States. Reuters reviewed chapter 3, the section on animal studies, which is the only section no longer covered by a confidentiality order of the court. Â The glyphosate review in IARCâs Monograph 112 runs to 92 pages; the chapter on animal studies consists of just over 10 pages. Reuters has not seen any other sections of the draft and cannot say whether they also underwent significant edits. In comparing draft and final versions of chapter 3, Reuters found that in several instances comments in the draft were removed; the comments noted that studies had concluded glyphosate was not carcinogenic. They were replaced in the final version with the sentence: ""The Working Group was not able to evaluate this study because of the limited experimental data provided in the review article and supplemental information."" This sentence was inserted six times into the final version. Each time it replaced a contrary conclusion, noted in the draft, by the original investigators on the study being considered, such as: ""The authors concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic in Sprague Dawley rats""; ""The authors concluded that glyphosate technical acid was not carcinogenic in Wistar rats""; and âThe authors concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic in CD-1 mice in this study.â Reuters also found changes to the conclusions and statistical significance of two mouse studies. These studies were cited in IARC's ultimate finding of ""sufficient"" evidence that glyphosate causes cancer in animals. One edit concerned a 1983 study in mice. IARCâs published monograph contains a fresh statistical analysis calculation as part of its review of that study. The original investigators found no statistically significant link between glyphosate and cancer in the mice. IARCâs new calculation reached the opposite conclusion, attributing statistical significance to it. This new calculation was inserted into the final published assessment, but was not in the draft version seen by Reuters. The change gave the working group more evidence on which to base its conclusion that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic. In further discussion of the same 1983 study, IARCâs final published report refers to expert pathologists on a panel commissioned to re-analyse the work of the original investigators. The IARC draft notes that these pathologists âunanimouslyâ agreed with the original investigators that glyphosate was not related to potentially precancerous tissue growths in the mice. IARCâs final report deletes that sentence. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Got a confidential news tip? Reuters Investigates offers several ways to securely contact our reporters Reviewing a second mouse study, the IARC draft included a comment saying the incidence of a type of animal cancer known as haemangiosarcomaÂ was ânot significantâ in both males and females. IARCâs published monograph, by contrast, inserts a fresh statistical analysis calculation on the data in male mice, and concludes that the findings were statistically significant. INFLUENTIAL MONOGRAPH IARC's assessment that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen is an outlier. In the 40 or so years since the weedkiller first came to the market, glyphosate has been repeatedly scrutinised and judged safe to use. A year after IARC issued its evaluation, a joint United Nations and World Health Organization panel reviewed the potential for glyphosate in food to cause cancer in people. It concluded the weedkiller was ""unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans."" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which first assessed glyphosate in the 1980s and has reviewed it several times since, says it has âlow toxicity for humans.â The European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency, which advise the 28 members of the EU, have also assessed glyphosate within the past two years and ruled it safe. But IARCâs Monograph 112 has had great influence. It is weighing heavily on a pending European Union decision â due by the end of the year and possibly to be made next week - on whether glyphosate should be relicensed for sale across the 28 member states. France, one of the bloc's agricultural powerhouses, has said it wants the weedkiller phased out and then banned, provoking protests by its vocal farmers, who argue glyphosate isÂ vital to their business. A failure to renew glyphosate's licence by the end of the year would see an EU ban kick in on Jan. 1, 2018. In the United States, Monsanto â the firm that first developed and marketed glyphosate - is facing litigation in California involving at least 184 individual plaintiffs who cite the IARC assessment and claim exposure to RoundUp gave them a form of cancer known as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They allege Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the risks. Monsanto denies the allegations. The case is ongoing. Members of the U.S. Congress, concerned about what they described as IARCâs âinconsistentâ standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, last year launched investigations into American taxpayer funding of IARC. The investigations are ongoing. In Europe, IARC has become embroiled in a public spat with experts at the European Food Safety Authority, which conducted its own review of glyphosate in November 2015 and found it âunlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.â With IARC monograph meetings, some outside observers are selected and allowed to witness proceedings, but they are banned from talking about what goes on. Journalists are generally not allowed in. Last year, Reuters reported on an email sent by IARC to the experts on its glyphosate working group in which the agency advised them not to discuss their work or disclose documents. The email said IARC âdoes not encourage participants to retain working drafts or documents after the monograph has been published.â Reuters sent questions about the draft version of the glyphosate assessment to members of the IARC working group that assessed the herbicide as well as to the head of IARCâs monograph programme, Kurt Straif, and to Kathryn (Kate) Guyton, the staffer responsible for the glyphosate review. IARC responded by posting the following message on its website: âMembers of the IARC Monograph Working Group which evaluated glyphosate in March 2015 have expressed concern after being approached by various parties asking them to justify scientific positions in draft documents produced during the Monographs process. IARC would like to reiterate that draft versions of the Monographs are deliberative in nature and confidential. Scientists should not feel pressured to discuss their deliberations outside this particular forum.â IARC answered none of Reutersâ specific questions about changes to the draft.

263, ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected move to “de-certify” the international nuclear deal with Iran is driving a wedge between Europe and the United States and bringing Europeans closer to Russia and China, Germany said on Thursday. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has spoken out repeatedly against Trump’s likely step, but his latest comments aimed to spell out the impact it would have in starker terms. “It’s imperative that Europe sticks together on this issue,” Gabriel, a Social Democrat, told the RND German newspaper group. “We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA.” Trump is seen unveiling a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday, including a move to de-certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.” Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unravelling of the agreement. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has repeatedly certified that Iran is adhering to restrictions on its nuclear energy programme mandated by the deal to help ensure it cannot be put to developing atomic bombs. Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear work. Germany has close economic and business ties with Russia, although relations have soured since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. Berlin is also working to expand ties with China. Gabriel is expected to leave his post in coming months since his Social Democrats have vowed to go into opposition after slumping badly in the Sept. 24 election, opting not to reprise an awkward “grand coalition” with Merkel’s conservatives. Gabriel on Monday urged the White House not to jeopardise the nuclear agreement, saying such a move would worsen instability in the Middle East and could make it more difficult to halt nuclear arms programmes in other countries. In the interview released on Thursday, he said the nuclear agreement was being treated “like a football” in U.S. domestic politics, but the issue could have serious consequences. He said Russia was watching developments closely, including the divisions between Europe and the United States. “That doesn’t exactly strengthen our position in Europe.” Ultimately, Gabriel told the newspaper group, there were only three countries - the United States, Russia and China - that could avert a new nuclear arms race. “But those countries mistrust each other so much at the moment that they are not working together sufficiently. It must be in our interest to press for more trust.” ","

266, ,10192017,Reuters,10122017,"(This Oct. 18 story corrects age in paragraph 19 to five, not six) By Tom Bergin LONDON (Reuters) - The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds ($5 million), according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England. The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country’s deadliest fire since World War Two. While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don’t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL). The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain’s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts. The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far. Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable. If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said. “The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,” said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims’ families. “It’s not about money for the families,” said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire. “Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it’s quite insulting.” The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say. While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society. They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said. “There is an affordability issue,” said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible. Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased. Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims’ families, also said he didn’t expect there to be many claims. Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them. The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims. One five-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire. Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents’ income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, did not respond to requests for comment on the Reuters calculation. Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral. Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds. However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms. Based on the victims’ circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds. Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower’s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze. Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire. Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding. Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool’s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy. More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc.’s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings. Arconic’s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool’s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period. Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases. In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims’ families and survivors more than $200 million. Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad. However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff’s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States. Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there. But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries. “I can’t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,” said Thomas. Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them. ","

270,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Plc said on Monday it signed an agreement with health insurer Aetna Inc under which payment for its insulin pump systems will be tied to how well diabetes patients fare after switching from multiple daily insulin injections. The deal is the latest example of the move toward contracts for prescription drugs and medical devices that attempt to bring down soaring healthcare costs by tying reimbursements to whether the products achieve their intended results. The deal with Aetna will measure health outcomes for  patients who transition to one of three Medtronic pumps that self-adjust to keep blood sugar levels in proper range based on patients’ individual needs for insulin. “This agreement reinforces our shift towards value-based healthcare,” Hooman Hakami, president of the Medtronic diabetes group, said in a statement. “We know technology alone isn’t enough and ultimately improved outcomes are what matter.” Patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 who have progressed to the need for insulin typically check blood sugar levels several times a day and inject insulin as needed. The pumps eliminate that chore. Medtronic declined to discuss financial details of the Aetna agreement, but said such deals tie revenue to achievement of clinical improvement targets, as well as shared savings for delivering on or exceeding clinical outcomes and cost targets. Suzanne Winter, vice president of the Medtronic diabetes group in the Americas, said the Aetna agreement will initially focus on whether patients on its pumps achieve their A1c targets, a commonly used measure of blood sugar levels. The American Diabetes Association recommends A1c levels below 7. In the future it may look at other measures, such as hypoglycemia episodes, time in proper glycemic range, and patient satisfaction, Winter said. Medtronic already has an agreement with UnitedHealth Group Inc that is moving toward including patient outcomes and other metrics, such as total cost of care, and the company is discussing similar deals with other insurers, Winter said. Pharmaceutical companies are also beginning to embrace reimbursement options that take patient outcomes into consideration. U.S. biotech Amgen Inc, in an effort to improve patient access to its expensive new cholesterol drug Repatha, has offered contract options that include refunding the cost of the drug if patients suffer a heart attack or stroke while on the medicine intended to prevent them.

271,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled legislation that would replace Obamacare with a plan that scales back aid to the poor and kills a tax on the wealthy, but the bill’s fate was quickly thrown into question as several senators voiced skepticism. Four conservative lawmakers said they could not support it in its current form, leaving Republicans short of the votes they need for passage. Democrats are united in opposition. The 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump by rolling back former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to millions of Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. Trump welcomed the bill but indicated that changes may be in store. “I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!” he wrote on Twitter. Trump urged the House of Representatives to pass a similar bill in May, only to criticize it in private as “mean” once it passed. He said on Wednesday he wanted a health plan “with heart.” Democrats immediately attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage. “The president said the House bill was mean,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. “The Senate bill may be even meaner.” Obama weighed in on Facebook. “If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm,” he wrote. The Senate’s most conservative members said the plan did not do enough to scale back the U.S. government’s role. “This current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people,” said Senator Rand Paul, who along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson said they could not support it in its current form. Shares of hospital companies and health insurers rose on the bill’s release, with the overall S&P 500 healthcare sector closing up 1.1 percent at an all-time high. “The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,” said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Over months of often bitter debate, Republicans have struggled to craft legislation that lowers costs and reduces government involvement, while minimizing the inevitable disruptions that would come with a revamp of a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world’s largest economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, and the legislation is unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in 3 Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Senate measure maintains much of the structure of the House bill, but differs in several key ways. The Senate bill would phase out Obamacare’s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House version, waiting until after the next presidential election in 2020, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It would also allow states to add work requirements for some of the 70 million Americans who depend on the program. The legislation also provides more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance. Those subsidies would be based on income, rather than the age-based subsidies contained in the House bill - a “major improvement,” according to Republican Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate who has expressed concern over the bill’s impact on the poor. The Senate legislation provides less money, however, for the opioid epidemic, allocating $2 billion in 2018, compared with  $45 billion over 10 years in the House version. Both versions would repeal the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners, a key target for Republicans. They also would repeal a penalty imposed on large employers that do not provide insurance to their workers, and remove the fine that Obamacare imposes on those who choose to go uninsured. Policy experts said that would keep more young, healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool. The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market, allotting $15 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion a year in 2020 and 2021. It proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, but abortion-related restrictions are less stringent than the House version because of uncertainty over whether they would comply with Senate rules. They could be included in another Senate bill. McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill, which Republicans say would fix a collapsing health marketplace. “Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are,” he said. Democrats say they offered to help fix Obamacare but were rebuffed. The bill’s real-world impact is not yet known, but the CBO is expected to provide an estimate early next week. As lawmakers spoke about the legislation on the Senate floor, a protest erupted outside McConnell’s personal office, with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway, holding signs and chanting: “No cuts to Medicaid.” U.S. Capitol Police said 43 protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction. Aside from the quartet of conservatives, none of the other 48 Republican senators appeared to reject the bill out of hand. But several said they would check with home-state constituents before taking a position. “I expect there’s going to be a number of changes between now and the final vote,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.

272,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s L1 Retail has agreed to buy Britain’s Holland & Barrett for 1.77 billion pounds in its first acquisition, betting on continued growth and expansion abroad for the health foods chain. L1 Retail, part of Fridman’s empire that spans investments in ride-hailing firm Uber to North Sea assets, said it expected to complete the purchase from The Nature’s Bounty Co. and The Carlyle Group by September, subject to regulatory approvals. Britain’s retailers face an uncertain future, with consumer spending slowing and online competition picking up. Luxury clothing chain Jaeger fell into administration in April, while dealmaking has also been on the rise, with Brazil’s Natura set to buy The Body Shop from L’Oreal. However, some industry experts think healthier foods could prove a resilient part of the market, with online giant Amazon.com agreeing to buy U.S. chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion earlier this month. Researchers Euromonitor reckon the health and wellness market grew 4.8 percent a year between 2011 and 2016, reaching a total value of $704 billion last year. Holland & Barrett, whose products range from vitamins and homeopathic remedies to “free from” foods for allergy sufferers, says it has grown same-store sales for 32 consecutive quarters, with revenues topping 610 million pounds in 2016. While focused mainly in Britain, the 1,000-plus store chain has been expanding abroad as well as online, helping to catch L1 Retail’s eye. “We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from structural growth in the ... health and wellness market and has multiple levers for long term growth and value creation,” said L1 Retail managing partner Stephen DuCharme. Holland & Barrett was founded in 1870, but traces its roots in health and wellness back to 1920 when Samuel Ryder - who went on to sponsor the international golf tournament that bears his name - set up a company specialising in herbs. Jonathan Buxton, partner and head of retail at Cavendish Corporate Finance, said the takeover by L1 Retail could help Holland & Barrett fend off growing competition. “With this kind of investment, we would expect that the retailer will continue to invest in its stores but more importantly, seek to increase its online presence to push back against the likes of Amazon following its acquisition of Whole Foods,” he said. According to Forbes, Fridman reached the seventh spot in Russia’s 2017 rich list, with wealth of $14.4 billion (11.31 billion pounds). Though he has moved his base to London from Moscow, the 53-year-old and his partners still own major assets in several industries in Russia, including a majority stake in Russia’s biggest food retailer by sales X5 Retail, top-10 lender Alfa Bank and Russia’s third-biggest mobile operator Vimpelcom. However, since selling out of oil company TNK-BP to Russia’s state-owned energy group Rosneft in 2013, they have largely sought to invest outside Russia. L1 Retail’s advisers include Karl-Heinz Holland, former CEO of German discount retailer Lidl Group, and Clive Humby, a founder of retail data pioneer dunnhumby. A spokesman for L1 told Reuters the company would create a board for Holland & Barrett that would include L1 Retail’s advisory board and investment team, possibly some outside non-executive directors and the chief executive and chief financial officer of the chain. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature’s Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for $3.8 billion. Reuters reported in January that Carlyle had hired Goldman Sachs to help it sell Nature’s Bounty, but that it might opt to sell Holland & Barrett separately. Carlyle was advised by Goldman Sachs, Houlihan Lokey, UBS, PwC, Latham Watkins and OC&C. ","

The donation by Prince Mohammed bin Salman went to the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization (WHO), as requested by the organizations, a statement by the Saudi ministry of culture and information said. It would help them “respond effectively to the cholera situation in Yemen, through a combination of water, sanitation and healthcare activities”, it said. The number of suspected cases of the disease, which is caused by the contamination of water or food by faeces, reached 179,548 by June 20, with 1,205 deaths, according to the WHO. U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien has described the cholera outbreak as a “man-made catastrophe” caused by the warring sides in Yemen’s civil war and their international backers. The country has suffered an economic collapse in two years of fighting which has left 19 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 3 million and ruined much of its infrastructure. As defense minister, Prince Mohammed is regarded by diplomats and analysts as a prime mover behind the Saudi decision to take military action in Yemen.1 The exiled Yemeni government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to roll back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.

275,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will use the premise of a national security review of the U.S. steel industry to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global steel market, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Thursday. The Trump administration expects to delay the release of the hotly anticipated study until after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the summit in Germany next week, another administration official said on Thursday, requesting anonymity. The official said the delay was due to July 4 holiday week scheduling issues, with “no cause or linkage” to the Group of 20 meeting. But the “Section 232” review will be a hot topic at the gathering in Hamburg. The report could lead to broad new U.S. quotas or tariffs on imported steel, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had previously said he hoped to reveal its findings by the end of June. “The premise of that report we will use as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world about what’s going on in steel,” Cohn said on Thursday. The study invokes a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense. The administration official declined to provide details on the findings of the study, which the department aims to use as a catalyst to help reduce excess global production capacity, particularly in China. But American companies that consume steel have been “vigorously” lobbying Trump administration officials against major new tariffs on foreign steel that would raise prices of the key raw material, a lobbyist with clients on both sides of the debate said. He compared the anti-tariff push to efforts by corporate CEOs in April to stop Trump from withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, with many calling the White House to try to persuade the president to change his mind. Russia requested a discussion on the U.S. steel 232 investigation at the World Trade Organization’s Council for Trade in Goods meeting on Friday, signaling that any new import restrictions could face challenges from WTO members. Russia is a significant steel exporter to the United States. The Trump administration, asked whether provisions would be made for NATO allies, many of whom supply steel products to the U.S. defense industry, to negotiate an exemption from tariffs, said: “I wouldn’t call them exemptions. There is an interest in negotiating collective action which would deal with the problem in a more global way.” Ross has said he believes there is a “genuine” national security concern over the steel industry’s health and one possible remedy is to impose import quotas on certain products coupled with tariffs on any amounts that exceed the quotas. Ross told a German economic conference that such measures might have to be “broad-scale” but would be aimed at provoking a collective solution to deal with global steel excess capacity. Cohn told the news briefing on Thursday that Trump would engage in discussions with G20 counterparts about promoting “free and fair trade,” including taking concrete actions to solve the excess capacity problems in the steel sector. But Cohn added that the Trump administration “will act to ensure a level playing field for all.” ","

Zhai, one of China’s richest women and president of the privately-owned HeungKong Group Ltd, said she never forgot her humble upbringing in Guangzhou in southern China where her father was an architect and her mother worked in a store. This made her determined to help others and she started donating to charity shortly after setting up the business with her husband in 1990. As their business grew, taking in real estate, financial investment and healthcare, Zhai broke new ground in 2005 by establishing China’s first non-profit charity foundation. Since then the HeungKong Charitable Foundation has helped an estimated 2 million people, by funding 1,500 libraries, providing loans for women to start businesses, and funding  orphans, single mothers, handicapped children and the elderly. “I realized there were a lot of poor people in China and this drove me to earn more money so I could help them,” said Zhai, 53, who was one of nine philanthropists named on Thursday as winners of the 2017 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Zhai and her husband Liu Zhiqiang, whose HeungKong Group with 20,000 staff has made them worth about $1.4 billion according to Forbes magazine, are known for being leaders of the culture of philanthropy in China. Their foundation was listed as number 001 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Zhai said at the end of 2015 there were 3,300 registered non-profit charity foundations in China. “By setting up the foundation I wanted to encourage other people, other entrepreneurs, to also donate to charity,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Guangzhou translated by her daughter. “Now I want to make sure that the next generation continues this culture of philanthropy in China,” she added, with two of her four children taking an active role in her foundation. The other philanthropists to win the Carnegie Medal - that was established in 2001 and is awarded every two years - came from across the globe. The list included India’s education-focused Azim Premji, Canadian-born social enterprise pioneer Jeff Skoll and American- Australian lawyer and former World Bank Group president James Wolfensohn.

As part of a complex series of financial transactions, ANZ ended up with ownership documents for nickel stored in Singapore and South Korea, but discovered they were fraudulent when it tried to sell the metal, the court papers said. ANZ has not yet filed a lawsuit, but the bank told the U.S. court it planned to do so in Asia once it discovered who was behind the fraud. ANZ “has every intention of pursuing causes of action against... fraudsters, once their identities are known”, the papers said. Marex had said in a statement it rejected the claim and issued a separate claim against Access World for an unspecified amount because it said the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic. Natixis and Access World had declined to comment. The fraud was uncovered following repurchase transactions between ANZ and two Hong Kong firms involving 84 warehouse receipts for nickel of which 83 turned out to be fake, the court papers filed by ANZ said. ANZ’s court filing included copies of the purchase contracts, showing the transactions involved 32,964 tonnes of nickel, which at current benchmark prices CMNI3 would be worth about $306.4 million. The deals were arranged by broker ED&F Man, which was not involved in the fraud and was cooperating to identify those responsible, ANZ added in the legal documents. “ED&F is not involved in this legal action and has no further comment to make,” the broker said in an emailed statement. ANZ said in the U.S. court papers that it had already unearthed information in Hong Kong after it asked courts there for access to bank records. For example, those bank documents, included in the U.S. court filing, showed transfers of $151 million from the two Hong Kong firms involved in the nickel trades to people and entities in California. ANZ told the U.S. court it wanted to interview those parties in California that received the funds. ","

278,,6292017,Investopedia,6222017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A federal income tax is a tax levied by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the annual earnings of individuals, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities. Federal income taxes are applied on all forms of earnings that make up a taxpayer's taxable income, such as employment earnings or capital gains. Tax is collected from individuals and corporations by the city, state, or country in which the entity resides or operates. When the tax collected is credited to the government of the country’s account, it is referred to as federal tax. Federal tax is the money used by the government of a country to pay for the growth and upkeep of the country. Look at federal tax as “rent” charged to live in a country or the fee to use the resources provided by a country. When you pay tax to the American government, you’re in effect investing in your economy as the government uses the funds to build, repair or maintain infrastructure; fund the pensions and benefits of government workers; provide food and housing assistance to the poor; improve sectors such as education, defense, health, agriculture, utilities, public transportation, etc.; embark on new feats such as space exploration; provide emergency disaster relief; etc. The largest source of revenue for the federal government comes from the income of its residents. When people work for a company, group, or for themselves, they are compensated for the services that they render. They are mostly paid with cash, check, or direct transfer to their bank accounts. Workers receive their earnings either as net income or gross income. Net income is the total amount earned minus federal tax, which means that the company or payer has withheld the tax and paid it to the government on the worker’s behalf. Gross income includes the total amount of income, and the worker would have to pay the government what is owed. Tax deducted from income is known as the federal income tax. All money earned whether as a wage, a salary, cash gift from an employer, business income, tips, gambling income, bonuses, or unemployment compensation constitutes as income for federal tax purposes. The federal income tax is built on a progressive tax system, where higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate. Taxpayers who earn below an annual threshold set by the government would pay little to no tax, while workers who earn six figures or more annually have a mandatory tax rate that applies to their income. The tax rate that applies to each individual is set up in a marginal tax bracket that shows the highest tax rate to be paid on income earned. In effect, the amount of taxable income that one earns determines which tax bracket he would fall into. As of 2017, the table below shows the seven marginal tax brackets set up by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) for single or unmarried people. The marginal tax rate refers to the tax applied on a taxpayer’s next dollar earned. Unless a taxpayer is in the lowest marginal bracket of 10%, s/he would actually have two or more marginal tax brackets. An individual who is unmarried and earns $80,000 annually falls in the 25% marginal tax bracket. This means that: However, note that the tax rate that the individual will end up with is actually 19.67% = $15,378.75 / $80,000, even though his marginal tax rate is 25%. This rate is called the effective tax rate, and is the actual rate that the individual will end up paying the government from his income. It is important to distinguish between the general notion of income tax and federal income tax. In the United States, governments at the state level may also levy income taxes in addition to federal income taxes. Not all states have implemented state level income taxes. The states of Washington, Texas, Florida, Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, and Wyoming don’t have income tax. New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax dividends and interest income, and don’t apply taxes to wages, earnings, or other income. ",Federal Income Tax | Investopedia,0.9586
279,,6292017,Investopedia,6222017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A federal income tax is a tax levied by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the annual earnings of individuals, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities. Federal income taxes are applied on all forms of earnings that make up a taxpayer's taxable income, such as employment earnings or capital gains. Tax is collected from individuals and corporations by the city, state, or country in which the entity resides or operates. When the tax collected is credited to the government of the country’s account, it is referred to as federal tax. Federal tax is the money used by the government of a country to pay for the growth and upkeep of the country. Look at federal tax as “rent” charged to live in a country or the fee to use the resources provided by a country. When you pay tax to the American government, you’re in effect investing in your economy as the government uses the funds to build, repair or maintain infrastructure; fund the pensions and benefits of government workers; provide food and housing assistance to the poor; improve sectors such as education, defense, health, agriculture, utilities, public transportation, etc.; embark on new feats such as space exploration; provide emergency disaster relief; etc. The largest source of revenue for the federal government comes from the income of its residents. When people work for a company, group, or for themselves, they are compensated for the services that they render. They are mostly paid with cash, check, or direct transfer to their bank accounts. Workers receive their earnings either as net income or gross income. Net income is the total amount earned minus federal tax, which means that the company or payer has withheld the tax and paid it to the government on the worker’s behalf. Gross income includes the total amount of income, and the worker would have to pay the government what is owed. Tax deducted from income is known as the federal income tax. All money earned whether as a wage, a salary, cash gift from an employer, business income, tips, gambling income, bonuses, or unemployment compensation constitutes as income for federal tax purposes. The federal income tax is built on a progressive tax system, where higher income earners are taxed at a higher rate. Taxpayers who earn below an annual threshold set by the government would pay little to no tax, while workers who earn six figures or more annually have a mandatory tax rate that applies to their income. The tax rate that applies to each individual is set up in a marginal tax bracket that shows the highest tax rate to be paid on income earned. In effect, the amount of taxable income that one earns determines which tax bracket he would fall into. As of 2017, the table below shows the seven marginal tax brackets set up by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) for single or unmarried people. The marginal tax rate refers to the tax applied on a taxpayer’s next dollar earned.

280,Ester Bloom,6292017,CNBC,6222017,"The House's version of the health care bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, was at last unveiled on Wednesday, with profound and far-reaching potential repercussions for how Americans are able to access and afford health insurance. Currently, Americans pay $3.4 trillion a year for medical care (and, unfortunately, don't get impressive results). According to the most recent data available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), ""the average American spent $9,596 on healthcare"" in 2012, which was ""up significantly from $7,700 in 2007."" It was also more than twice the per capita average of other developed nations, but still, in 2015, experts predicted continued sharp increases: ""Health care spending per person is expected to surpass $10,000 in 2016 and then march steadily higher to $14,944 in 2023."" Indeed, average annual costs per person hit $10,345 in 2016. In 1960, the average cost per person was only $146 — and, adjusting for inflation, that means costs are nine times higher now than they were then. According to eHealthInsurance, for unsubsidized customers in 2016, ""premiums for individual coverage averaged $321 per month while premiums for family plans averaged $833 per month. The average annual deductible for individual plans was $4,358 and the average deductible for family plans was $7,983."" That means that, last year, the average family paid $9,996 for coverage alone, and, if they met their deductible, a total of just under $18,000. Meanwhile, an average individual spent $3,852 on coverage and, if she spent another $4,358 to meet her deductible, a total of $8,210. These figures do not take into account any additional co-insurance responsibility she might have. In addition to co-pays and deductibles, an increasing number of plans now require co-insurance payments, which require that, even once you meet your deductible, you continue paying some percentage of all costs until you hit your out-of-pocket maximum. Young people, who are expected to benefit from lower premiums should the GOP repeal-and-replace efforts succeed, already pay the least. But even their costs can be considerable, depending on where they live. In 2016, the financial data site ValuePenguin found that the average costs for coverage for a 21-year-old go from $180 a month in Utah, plus a $2,160 deductible (potentially $4,320 a year, total), to $426 a month in Alaska, with a $5,112 deductible (potentially $10,224 a year, total). As a reminder, 72 percent of young millennials, aged 18-24, have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts and 31 percent have nothing saved at all.

281,"Proteus Duxbury, managing consultant for PA Consulting Group",6292017,CNBC,6222017,"With the uncertainty that surrounds federal efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, an opportunity is arising for states to take a larger role in health-care reform. Single-payer plans could be the answer to statewide coverage and lower health-care costs. Supporters argue that a single-payer 'Medicare-for-all' solution could provide universal coverage at a fraction of current costs while improving health outcomes. They propose that the average person would save more money on premiums than they would lose in tax increases. In addition, people would not lose coverage when they lose their job or when their income takes a dive. Skeptics argue that large losses incurred by healthcare providers, insurance companies, and those with generous policies makes single-payer healthcare politically unfeasible in the current climate. Many believe that that virtually free healthcare would result in unlimited demand that could only be curtailed by limiting services and care, also known as rationing. Immediate implementation will be challenging in the current political environment, but some states, including New York, California, Nevada, and Washington, are starting to put the pieces in place to maximize the longer term realization of new health-care models and their sustainability. Others, such as Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio and Hawaii have been active in trying to push through single-payer bills but the legislation appears to be stalled and unlikely to be taken seriously at this point. Look at California. The golden state introduced a bill in February 2017 that would make it the first state to adopt single-payer. Residents would pay into a state agency that functions as an insurance company, and the agency would in turn pay doctors and hospitals when people sought treatment. Previous proposals in California suggested financing the agency by pooling the state's current funding for Medicaid, Medicare and other health programs and then taxing employees 4 percent of their income and employers 7 percent of payroll. California has a veto-proof democratically controlled state legislature and could achieve some traction with this ambition. The cost could be fully offset through the elimination of premiums, copays, deductibles and other healthcare expenses, as well as the ability for the state to negotiate lower rates with healthcare providers and by managing the steep rise in healthcare costs more aggressively and with more precision. At 15 percent of state GDP, single-payer healthcare spending in California would be 3 percent lower than the amount the U.S. as a whole is currently sinking into healthcare. A focus on improving the health outcome of individuals will be critical. The Senate passed the bill on June 1 by a vote of 23-14; it now heads to the State Assembly. Restrictions in the ACA prevented states from passing single-payer and other new innovative models of healthcare without special permission before 2017. Now that the restriction has expired, states can, in theory, create their own ACA alternatives using a Sec. 1332 Waiver for state innovation. Some states, including Washington, have already filed waivers and submitted initiatives. In Washington, several House representatives have sponsored a bill this year that would establish a single-payer healthcare system using the ACAs Innovation Waiver. The plan opts to combine Medicaid and Marketplace plans into one single-payer solution, with no deductibles or premiums, but in trade presents rather high payroll and income tax hikes. And in New York, an ACA repeal could leave up to 2.7 million without coverage. In response, an Assembly member (who first proposed and passed a bill in 1992, and then again in 2015 and 2016) reintroduced a bill this year that would finance a universal Medicare expansion through progressive taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. General savings on the program would come from the state's ability to buy pharmaceuticals in bulk, while the legislation would be written so that everything currently covered by Medicaid and Medicare, like eye care and dental, will also be covered under the expansion. The bill has passed through the State Assembly and is currently headed to the Senate where it may get blocked. For now. Measures can be voted on by state legislators in voting cycles, including off-year and mid-term elections, and programs can be enacted as early as this year. In order to create a state-based coverage alternative, coverage quality and the number covered must be comparable to the current ACA standards, and the program can't add to the federal deficit. It can also only replace private coverage and not public programs like Medicaid. Technically, states are now in a position to create an ACA replacement using, at least in part, federal funding already provided. States that are looking to implement the single-payer model must address a number of challenges. First, the financing of a single-payer system typically requires replacing private insurance premiums with broad-based individual and corporate tax increases. Small businesses that don't currently insure their workers could be worse off because their taxes will increase without a reduction in premiums, and higher income, well-insured people, as well as many businesses (who pay more tax in general) will end up shouldering the majority of the funds needed to support such a model. They may see a reduction in the level of benefit currently being enjoyed. This will prove difficult to digest in many states and the messaging would have to be finely tuned to garner broad support. For example, in Colorado, voters overwhelmingly rejected ColoradoCare in November 2016, viewing the initiative as a tax-hike rather than the elimination of insurance premiums. Next, special interest groups would have to be expertly navigated and stakeholders aggressively engaged. There are clear losers from the introduction of single-payer plans. The most heavily impacted group, and potentially the most vocal and powerful, are health insurance companies. While some insurers would still do well by administering the system to pay provider claims, many would become irrelevant within states that implement a single-payer model. Local payers that have traditionally focused on the low-margin, but have a lean business of administering Medicaid (such as Managed Care Organizations), would have an advantage over the larger, commercially focused national firms. Additionally, a large single-payer network has substantial negotiating leverage to set and control healthcare reimbursement rates. This poses a significant threat to the profitability of large hospital systems, pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and other healthcare entities. In the short term, this may result in staff cutbacks and job losses. Therefore, supporters would need to stress the potential long-term benefits of moving to single-payer, which include a shift from provision to prevention, as well as the new job creation that this will enable. Finally, large employers with self-funded healthcare are unlikely to drop coverage for their existing employees in only one state. Therefore, they are unlikely to be supportive of an increase in corporate tax (essentially paying twice for healthcare). States have no regulatory authority over self-funded health plans; they can only be regulated at the federal level under a law known as ERISA. States will be powerless from intervening to restructure how these companies manage employee benefits. A shift over time to private exchanges and employee stipends to purchase their own coverage would lessen this complication. While states should renew their drive to reform health care on a local basis, the extent of the challenges means it is unlikely that any state (except possibly California) will move to a single-payer or a similar model in the short-term, even though these models could certainly result in a more equitable and fair provision of health care for Americans. That doesn't mean that those states with momentum won't be able to establish the necessary building blocks to succeed in the long term. New models could be tested using federal innovation grants and states can start putting in place the population health management prerequisites that will enable single-payer to thrive in the future.

Weighing on the shares is a weak outlook provided by management. Nonetheless, the chief executive was upbeat on the company's future and also saw a silver lining in Amazon's planned purchase of Whole Foods. ""Now is the time to move on and build our business and take it to the next level,"" Simon said in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" The CEO said the company completed the accounting review and audit process and found there was ""no material change"" to previously reported financials. He called it ""a great outcome."" Simon also was upbeat about Hain's general business outlook and its positioning in the organic and natural products space. ""We're in a great category in health and wellness,"" he said. ""The consumer will continue to eat healthy. We'll continue to look for 'better for you' products. And we have the brands and products that consumers want."" Hain's brands include Celestial Seasonings, Terra Chips and Garden of Eatin', among others. The company also is known for personal care products from Alba, Jason and Live Clean. On Thursday, Hain reported its delayed fiscal 2016 results after going more than a year without disclosing financials. The company also provided results for the first nine months of the current fiscal year ending June 30. It revealed that Hain's U.S. sales slowed in the nine-month stretch compared with the year-ago period and total sales were relatively flat. ""It's been a difficult year,"" said the CEO. ""There were a lot of things out of my control."" In particular, Simon said currency impacted the company's U.K. business and its turkey protein operation was hurt after prices came down. He also said there were issues with Hain's fruit business in the U.K. Hain also announced Thursday it would take $350 million of costs out of the business. Additionally, the company provided an initial fiscal 2018 outlook that was seen by some as rather optimistic. ""I feel good about going into 2018,"" Simon said. ""But what I feel good about is the brands that we own today, the products that we own globally around the world."" In addition to the internal accounting probe, Hain in February received a subpoena seeking ""relevant documents"" from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Hain's stock still hasn't fully recovered and remains 40 percent below where it was trading before the accounting issues were first disclosed in August. Even so, Simon has no plans to step aside. ""This is something that continues to grow, continues to evolve, and with that I think there's lots of runway left in Hain,"" he said. ""And there's lots of runway left within me."" Simon also was asked about Amazon's proposed purchase of Whole Foods, a major retailer selling organic and natural products. The CEO believes the deal is a good thing ultimately for Hain although some investors worry Amazon's bigger push into grocery will squeeze profit margins of big-brand consumer-packaged goods suppliers. ""Amazon is one of our fastest-growing customers,"" he said while also noting that Whole Foods is one of Hain's big customers. ""They want natural and organic products. Hain is in a strong position there."" Moreover, he said if there is price pressure from consolidation on the retail side it will be offset because Hain is cutting costs in its business to ""enhance our margins.""

This is Rachel at cardholder services,"" or ""This is an important notice about your automobile."" If you're like many Americans, you have probably received a robocall just like these, which have become a scourge for consumers despite increasing efforts to stop them. In May, there were 2.6 billion robocalls, or automatically dialed calls, in the U.S. That amounts to over eight calls a person, according to YouMail, an app designed to stop the pesky calls. ""Anytime you get a robocall in which somebody is trying to sell you a good or service, if you didn't give the caller prior expressed written consent for that call, that call is illegal,"" Janice Kopec, a staff attorney with the Federal Trade Commission, told CNBC's ""On the Money"" recently. The FTC's Do Not Call List was designed to stop telemarketing calls, yet robocalls are on the rise. They were up nearly 5 percent last month, according to YouMail's numbers, despite 226 active numbers registered with the Do Not Call List. All those unwanted calls have led to a massive surge in complaints. The FTC received nearly 3.5 million robocall complaints in fiscal year 2016, up 60 percent from the year before. ""The 'Do Not Call' registry actually works for legitimate businesses,"" said Alex Quilici, CEO of YouMail. ""The problem is all the people who don't respect it, who are the scammers who [couldn't] care less."" Calling for less than a cent Those scammers use new technology to call you in the hopes you will fall for their scam and hand over money. ""It's super easy to do, it's super cheap, and unfortunately, it works. People fall for the scams enough to make it worthwhile,"" Quilici said. The calls are often coming from overseas, where scammers try to stay out of the reach of regulatory authorities, according to the FTC. ""You can make millions of calls from anywhere in the world for a tiny amount of money, literally less than a cent a call,"" Kopec said. The Federal Communications Commission, which also regulates calls, received around 200,000 complaints annually. ""Unwanted calls — including illegal robocalls and telemarketing calls — are the top consumer complaint the FCC receives each year,"" the agency said in a statement sent via e-mail. Government crackdown The government is trying its best to crack down on robocallers, which has proved stubborn to defeat. The FCC is also testing letting phone companies block calls that are likely scams. ""We've brought over 130 law enforcement actions targeting those who send out unlawful calls and illegal calls,"" Kopec said. The FTC was awarded a $280 million judgment against Dish Network, a satellite television provider, for Do Not Call List violations, including some robocalls, earlier this month. ""DISH respectfully disagrees with the decision by the Court and will appeal the ruling. … DISH has long taken its compliance with telemarketing laws seriously, has and will continue to maintain rigorous telemarketing compliance policies and procedures,"" the company said in a statement sent to CNBC via email. The telecommunications industry is also working to stop robocalls, but challenges abound — such as the fact that some automated calls are actually legal. ""One of the things that consumers need to be aware of is that often times some of these robocalls ... we may not like them and they may not like to get them, but in most every state in the country, they're perfectly legal,"" said Kevin Rupy, vice president of law and policy for USTelecom, a trade group that represents landline providers. Aside from political calls, other robocalls such as school closures and push 911 messages are well withing the law, Rupy added. Another challenge is what is known as spoofing, when scammers change the number on caller identification. These sorts of calls look like a local call or that it is coming from someone you trust, like your bank. ""A lot of the criminal actors that are operating in this space are very sophisticated in how they're pushing these calls out to consumers,"" Rupy said. ""One example where you see is where the illegal robocallers will spoof the area code in the first three digits of the consumer's phone number, so that consumer believes that it could be the school calling, it could be my neighbor down the street calling, and they're going to be more inclined to pick up the phone,"" he added. To combat this, the industry is working on standards to add trustworthiness to caller ID. ""The wireless community — including wireless providers, handset vendors, and system providers — is united in its efforts to defeat robocalls,"" said Krista Witanowski, an assistant vice president of regulatory affairs at CTIA, a trade group that represents the wireless industry, in an e-mailed statement. ""These efforts, which collectively stop more than a million robocalls every day across the country, are ongoing and the wireless industry remains fully committed to stopping such nuisance calls,"" she added. What you can do to stop the calls Consumers also play a role in stopping robocalls. Here is what you can do.

The cupcake store they opened more than two years ago now has four employees, and they're hoping to open up additional locations. But chief among their concerns is the tax burden they face. Structured as an LLC, the company files taxes at the individual rate, paying some 35 cents on each dollar they make, Michael said, adding he's hoping for reform and lower rates under the new administration. ""We are in the process of trying to open up new stores, and just paying taxes on this one is taking capital away that we could be using on something else,"" he said. ""There is no clear-cut policy on where things are going right now. Compliance is extremely expensive for us, and it disproportionately affects us as a small business."" Taxes have long ranked as a top issue for America's small businesses, many of whom file as pass-through entities, combining business and personal income and, as a result, sometimes paying a higher effective rate. In the National Federation of Independent Business' 2016 ""Small Business Problems and Priorities"" study, federal taxes on business income ranked as the No. 3 issue behind the cost of health insurance and unreasonable government regulations. The first-ever CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey in June found that taxes were the No. 1 issue for 25 percent of the more than 2,000 businesses surveyed. North Carolina, where Melt in Your Mouth is based, revamped its tax code in recent years to lower both corporate and individual rates, which had a positive impact on its business competitiveness. In fact, in 2017 the foundation's ""State Business Tax Climate Index"" saw North Carolina jump from No. 41 to No. 11, the largest improvement ever recorded. The rate for individuals is currently 5.5 percent, while corporations pay 3 percent, but the state legislature is also working to lower rates even further in a pending budget deal. ""What North Carolina did is a good model for tax reform for the United States,"" said Joseph Henchman, vice president for State Projects at the Tax Foundation. ""Find a way to broaden the base of the tax system, lower rates for everybody, and make it more pro-growth."" The Trump administration is proposing parity for both small businesses and corporations in its blueprint to overhaul the tax code, bringing the rates from a top rate of 39.6 percent for individuals and 35 percent for businesses to an even 15 percent. The idea has been met with enthusiasm from Main Street advocates. House Speaker Paul Ryan also spoke out in favor of overhauling the tax code this week at the National Association of Manufacturers Summit Tuesday, pointing out the uneven playing field small businesses that file as pass-through entities find themselves on, compared to their corporate counterparts. ""Here in America, 8 out of 10 businesses file their taxes as individuals,"" Ryan said. ""In fact, most of our jobs come from these ... small businesses. Real tax reform ... means creating a new lower tax, specifically for small businesses, so they too can compete on a fair, level playing field."" For some businesses, like Jeremy Wanamaker's Waypoint Solutions Group, an IT services provider with locations in Charlotte and Albany, New York, it's more than just high rates. It's simply the complexity of complying with the federal tax code that's challenging. Wanamaker strategizes with his CPA to maintain competitiveness. ""We want to be as aggressive as we can while staying within the boundaries of the law,"" Wanamaker, CEO of the 30-person company, said. ""The tax code is too complicated. I think that small businesses are not able to reinvest money easily. The way we are taxed on our profits makes it difficult to reinvest. If we have a profitable year, we pay taxes on all of our profits, whether we use that money to take home or put it back into the business."" The Trump administration's proposal for parity between large and small businesses would be a ""very effective way"" to encourage small businesses to hire and grow, he said. ""If the tax rate on pass-through income was reduced, I could then take that money and reinvest it back into the business. That means hiring more people, buying equipment and doing something that impacts the economy as a whole."" While Michael Chambers of Melt in Your Mouth agrees, he's unsure Congress will be able to take action to move on tax reform anytime soon. ""They're pushing health care hard right now, and if they even manage to get that passed, I don't see them having anything left to be able to get any sort of meaningful tax reform through.""

288, ,6292017,CNBC,6222017,"The euro fell from a one-year high on Wednesday, after the European Central Bank said markets misjudged ECB President Mario Draghi's comments a day earlier. The hints in Draghi's speech to a major central bank conference in Portugal convinced investors that its policymakers are ready to start to withdraw the emergency stimulus for the economy that has dominated policy-making for almost a decade. That provoked the banking world's single biggest cheerleaders for a stronger dollar, Deutsche Bank, to abandon calls for a stronger greenback and instead call the end to a dollar rally dating back to 2014. ""Our main message is that the EUR is likely to be the key vehicle via which financial conditions in the Euro-area will be tightened,"" Deutsche analyst George Saravelos said in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""We now see the risks as shifting towards an attempted break-out of the euro's multi-year 1.05-1.15 range to the topside."" Saravelos, who at the height of the dollar's rally called for the euro to fall to $0.85 by the end of this year, raised his end of year forecast from $1.03 to $1.16. The euro fell 0.05 percent to 1.133 per dollar after it traded at $1.1376, a 1.4 percent gain, on Tuesday. The latest failure of Republicans to pass healthcare legislation in the United States was also playing in to the dollar's weakness, further undermining faith in President Donald Trump's promises of other measures to support growth. Eyes will again be fixed on the central banking conference in Sintra, Portugal, with several ECB officials speaking, along with Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and the Bank of England's Mark Carney. The dollar's weakness pushed sterling, again under pressure from Britain's recently volatile politics, above $1.28 to its highest since Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority on June 8. Conversely, it hit its weakest since November at 88.79 pence per euro. ""No matter the subtlety of any shift in guidance (by Draghi), the reaction in a yield-sensitive market is generally binary and we may well have to add currency appreciation to the risks facing ECB policy,"" said Bank of New York Mellon strategist Neil Mellor. ""Euro bulls may now feel that they have the perfect opportunity to challenge the post-2015 trading range whose ceiling is a couple of big figures north of spot.""

289,Dan Mangan,6292017,CNBC,6222017,"Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceuticals executive who gained public infamy by unapologetically hiking the price of a drug by more than 5,000 percent, on Monday begins jury selection for his trial on charges of securities fraud. Shkreli, 34, is charged in Brooklyn, New York, federal court with ripping off a drug company he founded, Retrophin, for millions of dollars for the purposes of repaying investors whom he allegedly also defrauded at hedge funds he ran. The trial could last for up to six weeks. The brash, social media and hip-hop-loving Brooklyn native, who has denied the allegations, was arrested on those charges in December 2015, months after garnering widespread scorn for raising the retail price of the drug Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill. Another company that Shkreli founded, Turing Pharmaceuticals, earlier that year had purchased the drug, which is used to treat a parasitic condition found in pregnant women, infants and people with HIV. The sky-high spike resonated with a public increasingly outraged by the cost of prescription medications. Shkreli quickly threw fuel on that fire by refusing to decrease the price of Daraprim. Shkreli also reveled in using Twitter to insult his many critics, who included then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Clinton's eventual opponent, Donald Trump, also joined in the public chorus denouncing Shkreli. None of that scorn deterred Shkreli, who later smirked while refusing to testify about Daraprim's price during an appearance before a congressional committee. Although it wasn't widely known at the time of the price hike, Shkreli was under federal criminal investigation for his tenure as CEO of Retrophin, the company he founded and ran before Turing. The company, echoed later by prosecutors, claimed that Shkreli had used publicly traded Retrophin like a personal piggy bank to pay back people who had invested in two Shkreli-run hedge funds with a series of stock transactions and consulting agreements. Shkreli is accused of misrepresenting the assets of those funds to investors to hide the fact the funds were money-losers. Prospective jurors on Monday are expected to be asked if they have any negative opinions about Shkreli based on widespread media attention he has received for the past two years. That attention has included stories about his purchase, for a whopping $2 million, of a single-copy album by the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, his heckling of Clinton outside her daughter's Manhattan apartment after she fainted last Sept. 11 after a 9/11 memorial event and his banning from Twitter for harassing a female journalist. Shkreli is being represented by a high-powered legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman, whose past clients have included Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the International Monetary Fund chief who was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. Brafman, after being hired by Shkreli, told reporters that he had told his client that he needed to stop talking to journalists. That hasn't happened. Last week, he granted an interview to The Associated Press. Shrekli also has continued livestreaming broadcasts online from his apartment, talking about investing, drug development, chess and more mundane matters to viewers. He also, while free on $5 million bail, has spoken at several colleges, including Princeton, where he recently agreed to pay a senior $40,000 for solving a math proof for a problem Shkreli had posed. Brafman last week said that offer, along with other monetary prizes posted by Shkreli, had not been paid, and that Shrekli was offering such rewards in an effort to remain in the public eye. The lawyer said that Shkreli was essentially cash broke, although he claimed his client was worth tens of millions of dollars from Shkreli's ownership stake in Turing. Brafman last week asked Judge Kiyo Matsumoto to reduce Shkreli's bail by $3 million so that the money could be used to reduce Shkreli's substantial tax liabilities, civil legal fees, and other debts related to both his tax issues and trial preparation. The judge has yet to rule on that request. The $3 million that Shkreli hopes to free up is in an E-Trade account being used to secure his release bail.

290,Sean Williams,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The big day has now come and gone. Yesterday, Republicans in the Senate unveiled their long-awaited healthcare reforms designed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which you probably know best by now as Obamacare. In March, House Republicans introduced the world to the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which some have dubbed ""Trumpcare."" After less than three weeks of back-and-forth debates among GOP members in the House, the AHCA was swept from the docket without going to vote because there wasn't enough support to pass the initial version. Image source: President Donald J. Trump's official Facebook page. Photo by Shealah Craighead. A little more than a month later, a second version of the bill emerged. It kept most of the initial version of the AHCA intact, but it added two new amendments designed to appease factions of the Republican Party who opposed the initial version. For more moderate House Republicans who felt that the AHCA would take away too much from sicker constituents, the Upton Amendment was introduced. It added $8 billion in additional funds (on top of a proposed $100 billion) to help states curb the inflationary pressures of treating patients with pre-existing conditions. For the Freedom Caucus, a group of GOP members who believe the AHCA didn't go far enough in distancing itself from Obamacare, the MacArthur Amendment was introduced, which allows states the option of applying for a waiver from Obamacare's 10 essential minimum benefits clause that each health plan is required to have. This secondary version of the AHCA passed by the narrowest of margins in the House. Here's a quick refresher of its key points: Image source: Getty Images. Of course, there were a lot of concerns with this plan. In particular, there were worries that stripping away income-based subsidies and replacing them with age-based credits would leave millions of low-income individuals and families on the outside looking in. There were also concerns about the elderly having to pay significantly more under Trumpcare than Obamacare, as well as folks with pre-existing conditions potentially being charged more. A handful of prominent Senate Republicans called the bill ""dead on arrival"" following the House vote. This pretty much set the table for Senate Republicans to craft their own version of healthcare reform, which was unveiled on Thursday. The 142-page bill introduced by Senate Republicans, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), kept a few components of the House's healthcare reform proposal, but really branched off to become its own unique bill. For instance, the BCRA would retroactively repeal the Shared Responsibility Payment (the penalty paid for not buying health insurance) all the way to the beginning of 2016, which is pretty similar to the repeal of the mandates and penalties described in the House bill. It also eliminates taxes on the wealthy, such as the 3.8% net investment income tax on individuals with more than $200,000 in modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), and the Medicare surtax of 0.9% on persons with MAGI above $200,000. Image source: Getty Images. But there are some very notable differences between the two plans. Here are a few biggies: There are a few other changes, but these are the most important. Image source: Getty Images. As you might expect, the Senate's bill isn't without controversy. While making healthcare more affordable for a number of healthier young adults, and providing protections for those with pre-existing conditions that weren't available under the AHCA, the BCRA has its drawbacks. For example, the middle class would take a hit with the federal poverty subsidy limits being scaled back. Additionally, older Americans still face significantly higher costs, especially those who qualify for a subsidy. Given what look to be some glaring problems with the bill, four Republican Senators have dug in their heels and announced that they have no intention of voting in favor of the current bill as it reads. They did not say they'll be voting no, but made it clear that further discussion would be needed before they would consider voting in favor of the BCRA. The four GOP senators are: All four senators released a joint statement that reads: Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor. There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current healthcare system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their healthcare costs. Though the Senate bill has yet to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which is what's halted moving the bill to the floor for debate and vote, chances are good that it'll provide the long-term reduction in healthcare costs that Rand Paul and his peers are seeking. Image source: Getty Images. It's no secret that both the AHCA and BCRA are probably going to be disliked by the public, but they do appear to provide health insurers with much-needed flexibility in pricing their plans. The waiver mandates and ability to charge older folks more (since older adults are often sicker than younger adults) is viewed as a critical component to keeping insurers involved, as well as to lowering healthcare premiums. National insurers UnitedHealth Group, Humana, and Aetna, were losing money hand over fist on Obamacare's exchanges and recently cut their coverage dramatically for 2017. Humana has said that it plans to pull out of the Obamacare exchanges entirely by next year. The danger in the Republican Senate health bill is that also allows insurers to pass along more out-of-pocket costs to consumers via higher deductibles. In other words, if you actually need to go to the doctor, you could be paying a lot more. What's more, Cruz, Paul, Johnson, and Lee are unlikely to get their way in distancing themselves any further from Obamacare, because doing so would mean rolling back subsidies on lower-income folks, which a vast majority of the American public have said they disagree with. As a reconciliation bill, the Senate only needs 50 votes for passage, since it's almost certain that Vice President Mike Pence would break the tie. Getting to 50 could still prove exceptionally challenging when, according to party lines, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes. With a July 4th recess looming, it looks as if healthcare reform may drag into late summer or the fall. ","

291,Todd Campbell,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Remember when every retailer's favorite company to hate was Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the big, bad box retailer that was destroying mom-and-pops and forcing small- and mid-sized department stores to close in droves? Despite cries to break it up, it's gone on to become America's biggest retailer by sales. Nowadays, it's Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) that's causing people to raise their pitchforks. But much like Walmart, making a case for breaking it up seems a bit silly, given how big and competitive retail remains. Amazon's pioneering of e-commerce continues to transform how consumers shop, and last week, the company's decision to tackle traditional brick-and-mortar retail by acquiring Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion increased worry that Amazon is getting too big for its britches. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But the numbers don't really suggest that Amazon is nearly as big as the media reports might have you believe. Yes, it does over $140 billion in sales annually, and acquiring Whole Foods adds another $15.7 billion in fiscal-year sales, but that's not really a lot when you consider industrywide revenue, and it's still miles south of the sales that Walmart racks up. According to Census data, e-commerce sales totaled $395 billion in 2016 and $106 billion in the first quarter of 2017 alone. Although e-commerce sales are growing quickly, they represent only 8.5% of the country's retail spending. If you divide Amazon's total sales into these figures, it accounts for 36% of 2016 e-commerce sales and 34% of first-quarter sales. Or, to put it differently, about two-thirds of e-commerce sales go to other retailers that sell online, too. Comparing Amazon's revenue to Wal-Mart also suggests that Amazon's a long way away from scary-big. In fact, Amazon's sales would have to more than triple to eclipse Walmart's sales in 2016. Data source: YCharts. It's also important to keep in mind that Amazon's revenue isn't all from its retail business. Amazon runs multiple businesses under its umbrella, and in this respect, it may be more like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway than J.C. Penney. In addition to being a retailer, it's also a technology services company (Amazon Web Services), a consumer electronics company (Kindle, Echo, Fire Stick), and a media company (Prime). Growing reliance on hosting services propelled Amazon's web services segment sales to $3.7 billion in Q1, up from $2.6 billion a year ago. That makes it a $15 billion business that's competing head to head against technology titans like Alphabet and Microsoft. According to industry watcher Gartner, the market for public cloud infrastructure will grow 36.8% to $34.6 billion worldwide this year. In consumer electronics, the company's Echo and Echo Dot are the market share leaders in the virtual-assistant market, but Alphabet, Sonos, Microsoft (via Cortana), and Apple Inc. (via Siri and soon the HomePod) all compete with it in that market. Similarly, Alphabet's Chromecast is stiff competition for Amazon's Fire Stick, as are smart TVs and DVRs. In tablets, Amazon competes with Apple, a consumer electronics Goliath with $216 billion in sales in 2016. Amazon's Prime service is similarly far from alone in the online entertainment market. Amazon battles Apple, Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and Alphabet, as well as others in online music. In online video, it competes with Alphabet's YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, broadcasters, and traditional and satellite television. Still think Amazon should be broken up? Consider that despite all of the worry over Amazon's size, its $142 billion in trailing-12-month sales still only ranks it 16th in size in terms of sales for companies with market caps over $20 billion. Toyota Motor, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth Group, and CVS Corp are some of the well-known names that remain far bigger than Amazon. Company Sales (billions/TTM*) Wal-Mart Stores $487 China Petroleum $299 Royal Dutch Shell $257 Petrochina Co. $250 Toyota Motor Corp. $248 Berkshire Hathaway $237 Apple Inc. $221 ExxonMobil Corp. $211 BP Plc $200 McKesson Corp. $199 UnitedHealth Group $189 CVS Health Corp. $179 General Motors Co $170 AT&T Inc. $163 Ford Motor Co. $153 Amazon.com, Inc $143 *Trailing 12 months. Chart by author. There's no denying that Amazon is laser-focused on disrupting multiple markets, that its innovation puts it in an enviable position of growing much bigger in the coming years, or that acquiring Whole Foods opens up all sorts of opportunities for the company to boost sales. But it's too early to say that Amazon is anywhere near a point where regulators would have to take action, or that it will ever be that big. Just as Amazon has taken the luster off Walmart, an upstart could eventually crimp Amazon's growth, too. Savvy investors should be focusing on that -- not on Amazon's risk of a breakup. ","

292,"Keith Speights, Timothy Green, and Matthew DiLallo",6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investing profits tend to correlate pretty well with the time horizons that investors have. If you're overly concerned about short-term gains, those gains are usually relatively small. But if you're focused on the long term, your investing gains are greater. With this premise in mind, we asked three of The Motley Fool's contributors to identify stocks for the long haul. Here's why they picked Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Property Partners): Owning real estate can be a great way for investors to earn healthy returns over the long-term. That's because they can benefit from collecting rental income as well as capturing appreciation as property values increase. While there are plenty of options available, a great one for the long-term is Brookfield Property Partners, which is one of the largest real estate owners in the world. Not only does Brookfield own some of the best office properties around the globe but it owns a significant stake in General Growth Properties, which controls many of the top malls in America. Further, Brookfield Property Partners has invested in several opportunistic real estate funds managed by parent company Brookfield Asset Management, giving it access to other property classes like student housing, multi-family, and self-storage. That diversified portfolio of properties makes it a one-stop shop for real estate investors. What's great about owning commercial real estate is that these properties throw off steady income. Because of that, Brookfield Property Partners pays a high distribution to investors that currently yields 5.1%. The company shouldn't have any problems sustaining that payout given that long-term leases back its properties, and it maintains a safe ratio of around 80%. The company further supports that payout with a solid balance sheet, backed by an investment-grade credit rating, a conservative debt-to-capital ratio of less than 50%, and primarily fixed-rate debt, which insulates it from interest rate hikes. Brookfield complements that incomes stream with clearly defined growth prospects. Overall, the company expects its funds from operations to increase 8% to 11% annually, thanks to a combination of rising rents, high-grading its portfolio with better-returning assets, and completing its development projects. This growth should drive 5% to 8% annual distribution growth. When we add up its heathy finances, compelling dividend, and visible growth, it shows that Brookfield Property Partners has all the characteristics an investor could want in a long-term holding. Tim Green (International Business Machines): If you plan on holding a stock for the long haul, it's best to choose a company that's already proven it can stand the test of time. IBM, while facing its fair share of challenges, has been around for over a century. It remains a highly profitable company, and it's one of the key players pushing artificial intelligence and big data forward. IBM is focused on growing its ""strategic imperatives,"" which include businesses like cloud computing, analytics, and security. Its Watson cognitive computing system is the most visible part of its strategy, and it's being used in various industries, including healthcare and financial services. At the same time, various legacy businesses are in decline. The net result has been five years of slumping revenue. Image source: Getty Images. But IBM's existing base of large enterprise customers gives the company a key advantage as those customers look to move to the cloud. A recent $1.7 billion deal IBM signed with Lloyds Banking Group, an existing IBM customer, to provide dedicated cloud offerings and manage the transition to the new cloud is exactly the kind of deal that will push IBM's cloud revenue higher. While it's no longer true that ""no one ever got fired for buying IBM,"" the IT giant remains a critical partner for many large organizations. Its cloud business may not be as headline-grabbing as AWS, but the company's approach should ensure that it sticks around for decades to come. Keith Speights (United Parcel Service): United Parcel Service is a stock for the long haul in more than one way. The packaged goods delivery company certainly has its fair share of literal long hauls: UPS delivered over 4.9 billion packages last year across more than 220 countries. The stock is also a great pick for investors who would like to buy and hold for quite a while. One such investor is Warren Buffett. Although UPS is one of the legendary investor's worst-performing stocks so far in 2017, I doubt that Buffett is in a hurry to sell his relatively small stake. The Oracle of Omaha usually likes to stick with a stock for the long haul if he can. UPS' recent woes stem from increased capital expenditures and resulting pressure on margins. I think those are short-term problems that are actually sowing seeds for long-term success. UPS is in large part reacting to higher costs associated with handling increased e-commerce volume. However, more e-commerce means great prospects for the company in the coming years. Warren Buffett likes the companies he buys to have moats -- protection against competitors stealing market share. UPS enjoys a pretty good moat. The company is in something of a duopoly with FedEx in the packaged good delivery market. It's too expensive for most companies to build the infrastructure needed to deliver at the scale these two companies do, so UPS and FedEx largely have the market to themselves. Although Amazon is building out its own delivery program, I agree with my colleague Travis Hoium that UPS should continue to thrive regardless of what Amazon does.

                                   stocks, 49% are “buy” ratings, 45% are neutral — and only 6% are “sell”ratings,” according to a June 23 report from FactSet analyst John Butters. A “sell-side” analyst is one who works for a brokerage firm or on the brokerage side of an investment bank, providing research reports and ratings to brokerage clients and often making them available to the financial media. The firm’s bankers also use the reports when pitching for business. A “buy-side” analyst is one who works for professional investors, including hedge funds. So sell-side analysts are the ones being quoted most often, especially when you see monotonous quarterly headlines saying which companies have beaten or missed consensus earnings estimates. Their earnings estimates and ratings, in turn, can help drive stocks higher, so it’s important to consider their opinions. Read: How to stop being your own worst enemy in the stock market It may not surprise you that most companies beat estimates each quarter, no matter what is going on in the economy. If sales and earnings are weak, analysts will often lower their estimates heading into earnings season, sometimes in response to companies lowering their earnings guidance. A conversation with almost any sell-side analyst will highlight a deep level of knowledge of the industry he or she covers, along with an approach to ratings that is based on price targets, which themselves are based on estimates for sales, earnings and cash flow. But there’s no denying that analysts shy away from placing the equivalent of a “sell” rating on a stock, or that “good news” (including good ratings) makes it easier for brokerage companies to earn commissions as investors buy shares. Gary Lutin, the chairman of the Shareholder Forum (which supports access to information investors need) and a former investment banker, said it was “sad” that “the current marketplace for financial services doesn’t offer jobs that will pay all these talented and highly skilled professionals to offer advice that doesn’t ring a banker’s cash register.” In other words, investors still face the same challenge of figuring out how to get the best information on which to base their investment decisions. This is why it pays to do your own research (reading not only analysts’ reports but company filings, news articles, and industry and academic reports), which your broker or investment adviser can help you with, at least partially. Form your own opinions about a company’s strategy to dominate its industry over the long term. Read: 24 money-manager clichés — and what they really mean Analysts are most “optimistic” about the health-care and information technology sectors, according to Butters, as both have the highest percentage of “buy” ratings: 57%. Here are ratings percentages for all 11 sectors of the S&P 500. Note: Because of rounding, the percentages for the ratings may not add up to 100%. So positive sentiment is low for the utilities and telecommunications sectors, but none of the sectors have double-digit levels of negative sentiment.

Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has topped three points under record territory, and once again pulled in to the range. A jagged slow-motion breakout attempt remains underway. Tactically, the 2,442 area matches consecutive session highs, and the top of the June gap. Separately, near-term support, circa 2,433, closely matches the 20-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop remains slightly stronger. The index initially gapped to record territory last week, and has thus far maintained the bottom of the gap (21,384) on a closing basis. Near-term resistance matches the 21,450 area , and is followed by the Dow’s all-time high of 21,535. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has tagged two-week highs — just above the 6,300 mark — and pulled in. Tactically, the former range top (6,243) remains a near-term inflection point. Delving deeper, more important support matches the 6,164 breakout point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has likely absorbed the mid-June FAANG-fueled key reversal. (The downturn paced by technology bellwethers Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.) The downside follow-through on the initial plunge has been contained, and effectively underpinned by the 6,164 breakout point on a closing basis. Resistance broadly spans from 6,310 to 6,321, levels matching the early-June peak, and the Nasdaq’s record close, respectively. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has staged a flat late-June pullback from record territory. Recall that the bottom of the gap (21,384) has essentially underpinned recent weakness, an area better illustrated on the hourly chart. More broadly, the June breakout builds on the Dow’s initially steep February rally. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. To reiterate, the 20-day moving average, currently 2,434, has underpinned the June range, and remains a near-term inflection point. The S&P has not closed lower since May 19. Though the big three U.S. benchmarks have asserted a late-June holding pattern, of sorts, the bigger-picture price action remains constructive. Consider that each index topped Monday firmly within view of record territory as follows: Though each benchmark reversed from session highs, the S&P and the Dow closed positive amid still flat late-June selling pressure. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has asserted a range-bound, but still bullish, June posture. The small-cap benchmark’s record close (142.10) and absolute record peak (142.90) remain within striking distance. A near-term target projects to the 145.50 area on a breakout. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has maintained the 50-day moving average, rising from support on increased volume. Tactically, the 320 area remains an inflection point, and is closely followed by the mid-cap benchmark’s record high (322.75) established June 13. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks remain longer-term well positioned, as illustrated on the three-year chart. Against this backdrop, the U.S. sub-sector price action remains rotational, and technically healthy, punctuated by recent biotech and health care sector breakouts. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has established a flag-like pattern, pinned to the late-May/early-June rally. The pattern has been underpinned by the 20-day moving average, currently 2,434. Delving deeper, firmer support spans from 2,405 to 2,416, areas matching the breakout point, and the FAANG-induced low. The ascending 50-day moving average, also currently 2,405, matches support, and the S&P 500’s intermediate-term path of least resistance points higher barring a violation.

Earlier this month, the yield violated the 200-day moving average, pressured despite the Federal Reserve’s June 14 quarter-point rate hike, its second this year. The subsequent price action has been flat, capped by the breakdown point (2.18). More broadly, the June downturn builds on the yield’s bearish double top — defined by the December and March peaks — a pattern that continues to project to the 2.00 area. Tactically, trendline resistance closely matches the 200-day moving average, currently 2.23, and a posture lower supports a bearish longer-term bias.

As a rate-sensitive sector, the group’s dividend yield looks comparably attractive against a falling interest-rate backdrop. Separately, real estate prices are also supported by lower rates. Technically, the group has resolved a bullish double bottom — the W formation — defined by the March and May lows. An intermediate-term target projects to the 84.50 area. Conversely, the breakout point (81.00) pivots to support and is followed by a near-term floor matching last week’s low (80.40).

296,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"ADEN (Reuters) - The death toll from a major cholera outbreak in Yemen has risen to 1,500, Nevio Zagaria, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) representative in Yemen, said on Saturday, and appealed for more help to put an end to the epidemic. Yemen has been devastated by a 27-month war between a Saudi-led coalition and the armed Iran-aligned Houthi group, making it a breeding ground for the disease, which spreads by faeces getting into food or water and thrives in places with poor sanitation. Speaking at a joint news conference with representatives of the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, Zagaria said that had been some 246,000 suspected cases in the period to June 30. The WHO said this week that the outbreak had reached the halfway mark at 218,798 cases as a massive emergency response has begun to curb its spread two months into the epidemic. Although most of Yemen’s health infrastructure has broken down and health workers have not been paid for more than six months, the WHO is paying “incentives” to doctors, nurses, cleaners and paramedics to staff an emergency cholera network. With funding help from the World Bank, the WHO is setting up treatment centers with 50-60 beds each, overseen by shifts of about 14 staff working around the clock. The aim is to reach 5,000 beds in total. ","

298,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"The PwC audit of the Italian business is coming under increasing scrutiny worldwide after a similar investigation launched in Britain last week. PwC said in an emailed statement it was not the company’s policy to comment on client issues. BT lost a fifth of its market value in January after revealing a 530 million-pound ($685 million) black hole in BT Italia’s accounts as a result of “improper accounting practices and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions”. In April the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asked Italian market watchdog Consob to send it documentation regarding the audits carried out by PwC on BT in the period 2014-2017, the source said. Consob provided the data after getting the go-ahead from the Milan prosecutors office which is carrying out a criminal probe into alleged false accounting and embezzlement. BT filed a criminal complaint in Italy in April accusing several former executives and other staff of unlawful conduct. Current and former staff told Reuters efforts to hide the Italian unit’s performance had gone on since at least 2013. A spokeswoman for PCAOB, which has the powers to fine or bar accounting firms or their individual associates, said the regulator did not confirm or comment on inspections as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under the act the PCAOB is required to supervise and inspect all accounting firms that regularly audit companies whose securities trade in the United States. While BT’s main listing is in London, its shares are also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares. Consob declined to comment, but a source close to the watchdog said the “regulator was giving its attention to the PwC issue”. Last week Britain’s accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it would investigate PwC audits of BT Group after the BT Italia scandal emerged. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the FRC and the PCAOB were collaborating on the PwC issue, although a spokesman for the FRC said the British watchdog maintained close contact with its counterparts in other countries to improve audit quality. BT said last month it would drop PwC, its auditors since 1984, after an evaluation found “areas for improvement”. It said it would move to KPMG [KPMG.UL], another one of the “Big Four” accounting firms. Since the scandal erupted, various BT shareholders in the United States have launched class action cases, accusing the telecoms group of not informing the market and shareholders soon enough of the financial irregularities at its Italian unit. In March a Reuters investigation found allegations that a network of people in BT Italia had exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to meet bonus targets and disguise the unit’s true financial performance. A source also told Reuters in March that he and two other employees at BT Italia had warned their Madrid-based supervisor about possible accounting problems at the business in November 2015, nearly a year before BT announced that it had found accounting irregularities at the Italian company.

299,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers’ knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain’s Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. “The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,” he said. “It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren’t as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.” Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker’s joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew’s products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company’s most important strategic investment for a decade. “We are now basically head to head with Stryker,” he said in an interview. “I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it’s Stryker or us.” COST-EFFECTIVENESS QUESTION Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. “As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,” Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. “Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven’t been specific about.” Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France’s Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew’s Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. “I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.” ","

Axis Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create a roughly $2 billion player in the London specialty market. The deal, expected to close in the final quarter of the year, will add to Axis’ earnings in the first year and allow it to bulk up in the Lloyd’s insurance market. “It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. Axis is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees,” John Hastings-Bass, chairman of Novae, said. Axis operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America. The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid. Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a “torrid” nine months for the company. “The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price,” Neptune’s Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae’s shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain’s Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune’s view.

302, ,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will use the premise of a national security review of the U.S. steel industry to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global steel market, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Thursday. The Trump administration expects to delay the release of the hotly anticipated study until after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the summit in Germany next week, another administration official said on Thursday, requesting anonymity. The official said the delay was due to July 4 holiday week scheduling issues, with “no cause or linkage” to the Group of 20 meeting. But the “Section 232” review will be a hot topic at the gathering in Hamburg. The report could lead to broad new U.S. quotas or tariffs on imported steel, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had previously said he hoped to reveal its findings by the end of June. “The premise of that report we will use as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world about what’s going on in steel,” Cohn said on Thursday. The study invokes a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense. The administration official declined to provide details on the findings of the study, which the department aims to use as a catalyst to help reduce excess global production capacity, particularly in China. But American companies that consume steel have been “vigorously” lobbying Trump administration officials against major new tariffs on foreign steel that would raise prices of the key raw material, a lobbyist with clients on both sides of the debate said. He compared the anti-tariff push to efforts by corporate CEOs in April to stop Trump from withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, with many calling the White House to try to persuade the president to change his mind. Russia requested a discussion on the U.S. steel 232 investigation at the World Trade Organization’s Council for Trade in Goods meeting on Friday, signaling that any new import restrictions could face challenges from WTO members. Russia is a significant steel exporter to the United States. The Trump administration, asked whether provisions would be made for NATO allies, many of whom supply steel products to the U.S. defense industry, to negotiate an exemption from tariffs, said: “I wouldn’t call them exemptions. There is an interest in negotiating collective action which would deal with the problem in a more global way.” Ross has said he believes there is a “genuine” national security concern over the steel industry’s health and one possible remedy is to impose import quotas on certain products coupled with tariffs on any amounts that exceed the quotas. Ross told a German economic conference that such measures might have to be “broad-scale” but would be aimed at provoking a collective solution to deal with global steel excess capacity. Cohn told the news briefing on Thursday that Trump would engage in discussions with G20 counterparts about promoting “free and fair trade,” including taking concrete actions to solve the excess capacity problems in the steel sector. But Cohn added that the Trump administration “will act to ensure a level playing field for all.” ","

303, ,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"June 30 (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers International (USW) has warned executives at the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast that its members are prepared to strike unless cuts to health and pension benefits are restored, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. A warning letter was delivered on Wednesday to Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), a joint venture between Carlyle Group and Energy Transfer Partners of the 335,000-barrel-per-day refinery on the south side of Philadelphia. The local USW chapter has scheduled emergency meetings for next week, and a strike authorization vote could come in the next two weeks, the sources said. The refinery is a key gasoline and diesel suppliers for the Mid-Atlantic, one of the busiest parts of the country in terms of refined product demand. PES forced employees to contribute more to their health plans and suspended pension contributions last September as the fat refining margins from the Bakken rail boom disappeared. The local union contested the cuts, and the issue is in arbitration. The USW did not immediately respond to requests for comment and PES declined to comment on Friday. A refinery strike unrelated to new contract negotiations would be highly unusual since all union contracts typically include no-strike clauses. Several refineries were hit by strikes in 2015 after contract negotiations stalled, forcing some to temporarily close. Carlyle helped rescue the refinery from closure in 2012. The move paid big dividends early as the refinery leveraged cheap crude shipped by rail from North Dakota’s Bakken oil fields to amass large profits. However, the Bakken discount has disappeared, and so have the trains, sapping profits. PES and other East Coast refiners have been forced to return to refining West African crudes.

As part of a complex series of financial transactions, ANZ ended up with ownership documents for nickel stored in Singapore and South Korea, but discovered they were fraudulent when it tried to sell the metal, the court papers said. ANZ has not yet filed a lawsuit, but the bank told the U.S. court it planned to do so in Asia once it discovered who was behind the fraud. ANZ “has every intention of pursuing causes of action against... fraudsters, once their identities are known”, the papers said. Marex had said in a statement it rejected the claim and issued a separate claim against Access World for an unspecified amount because it said the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic. Natixis and Access World had declined to comment. The fraud was uncovered following repurchase transactions between ANZ and two Hong Kong firms involving 84 warehouse receipts for nickel of which 83 turned out to be fake, the court papers filed by ANZ said. ANZ’s court filing included copies of the purchase contracts, showing the transactions involved 32,964 tonnes of nickel, which at current benchmark prices CMNI3 would be worth about $306.4 million. The deals were arranged by broker ED&F Man, which was not involved in the fraud and was cooperating to identify those responsible, ANZ added in the legal documents. “ED&F is not involved in this legal action and has no further comment to make,” the broker said in an emailed statement. ANZ said in the U.S. court papers that it had already unearthed information in Hong Kong after it asked courts there for access to bank records. For example, those bank documents, included in the U.S. court filing, showed transfers of $151 million from the two Hong Kong firms involved in the nickel trades to people and entities in California.

XLV is up 16% through the first half of 2017 compared to a gain of just over 9% for the S&P 500. Underscoring the strength in the healthcare sector is this data point: five of the top 10 sector ETFs on a year-to-date basis are healthcare funds. Proving that the rally in the group is widespread, those five ETFs include a small-cap fund, biotech ETFs and the high-flying iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI).

Still, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals stocks, among others, jumped late last month after the Obamacare replacement legislation was unveiled. “Favorable elements in the bill, according to analysts, included the elimination of taxes on industry and provisions to stabilize the insurance exchanges set up under former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law,” according to Reuters.

""Today, we are taking a decisive step towards materializing these ambitions."" Lamarre told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Thursday that the deal was a ""strategy of diversification"" for the famous circus company. ""We have the opportunity to have a new brand that we are going to bring to its full potential around the world,"" Lamarre said. ""Cirque du Soleil is an amazing marketing and distribution machine around the world, and the Blue Man Group deserve the support of an organization like ours to continue to grow around the world."" The ambitions were put in motion two years ago when TPG, a $73 billion private-equity firm, took a majority stake. At the time, The Wall Street Journal reported that the investment valued Cirque du Soleil at $1.5 billion. Fosun Industrial Holdings, a Chinese investment firm, and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, a Canadian pension fund, also took a stake in Cirque du Soleil at the time TPG did. TPG owns stakes in a variety of entertainment brands including Creative Arts Agency, Spotify and Univision. TPG's growth-investing arm also co-founded STX Entertainment, which produced movies such as ""Edge of Seventeen"" and ""Bad Moms.""

The forfeiture will include some 5,500 artifacts purchased by Hobby Lobby that originated from the region of modern-day Iraq and were shipped under false labels, as well as an additional $3 million to settle the civil charges, the Department of Justice said in a statement. ""The protection of cultural heritage is a mission that (Homeland Security Investigations) and its partner U.S. Customs and Border Protection take very seriously as we recognize that while some may put a price on these artifacts, the people of Iraq consider them priceless,"" Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said in the statement. Privately-held Hobby Lobby said that it was new to the world of antiquities when it began acquiring historical items for its Museum of the Bible in 2009 and made mistakes in relying on dealers and shippers who ""did not understand the correct way to document and ship"" them. The company's president, Steve Green, is the chairman and founder of the Museum of the Bible, which is under construction in Washington, D.C. The artifacts being forfeited include cuneiform tablets and bricks, clay bullae and cylinder seals. Cuneiform is an ancient system of writing on clay tablets. ""At no time did Hobby Lobby ever purchase items from dealers in Iraq or from anyone who indicated that they acquired items from that country,"" Green said in his statement. ""Hobby Lobby condemns such conduct and has always acted with the intent to protect ancient items of cultural and historical importance. ...

309,"Mark Henricks, special to CNBC.com",7062017,CNBC,6292017,"These days, hardly anybody believes the American retirement dream is doing all right. In fact, 88 percent of Americans agree that the nation faces a retirement crisis, according to a 2017 survey by the Washington, D.C.-based National Institute on Retirement Security pension research group. However, a small but vocal group of scholars is advancing an opposing viewpoint. They say Americans' chances for financial security in retirement are in better shape than is commonly supposed. So is it possible the retirement crisis is oversold? ""It's not merely possible, it's probable,"" said Andrew Biggs, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and former deputy commissioner for policy at the Social Security Administration. For one thing, he notes that while many contend low-earning Americans aren't saving enough for retirement, poverty is lower during retirement than during people's working years. A 2016 Census Bureau report shows that in 2015 just 8.8 percent of people 65 and older were impoverished, compared to 19.7 percent of children under 18 and 12.4 percent of 18- to 65-year-olds. If there were a crisis, Biggs says, retired people should be complaining. Yet a 2016 Gallup poll found 74 percent of U.S. retirees say they are living comfortably. And a 2017 Vanguard report found just 16 percent of retirees were dissatisfied with their financial situation, compared with 21 percent of pre-retirees. More from FA Playbook: The pros, cons of paying off mortgages before retirement Swelling ranks of retirees negatively impacting returns Retirement saving remains a challenge for many women Perhaps most surprisingly, Biggs points to recent research suggesting retiree incomes generally match or even exceed their pre-retirement incomes. A 2017 study by Internal Revenue Service and Investment Company Institute researchers analyzed tax returns and found most people experience no income dropoff after claiming Social Security. In fact, the median household's income rises after retirement. ""It's hard to paint a picture where this leads to a true retirement crisis,"" Biggs said. Retirement policy can get tangled up in ideology, partisan politics and Beltway power struggles. Presumably, those concerns would not influence a Canadian such as Frederick Vettese, chief actuary at Toronto-based human resource advisor Morneau Shepell and author of The Essential Retirement Guide: A Contrarian's Perspective. Vettese also doubts the retirement crisis. ""The retirement savings crisis has definitely been oversold,"" he said. ""A good indication of this is that pre-retirees have a significantly higher level of concern about whether they are financially prepared for retirement than is the case for retirees."" Buttressing Vettese's point, the 2017 Vanguard study found that 10 percent of U.S. pre-retirees considered their financial situation to be in crisis, while just 4 percent of retired people felt likewise. Vettese says those who warn of crisis are basing their concern on ""highly flawed"" estimates of what a comfortable retirement costs. The General Accounting Office in 2015 examined competing claims for existence of a retirement crisis and agreed that varying estimates of post-retirement spending needs explained most of the disagreement. In general, financial planners say retirees need about 70 percent of pre-retirement income to be secure in retirement. Some believe the figure should be much higher. In fact, the National Institute of Retirement Security uses 85 percent as a benchmark. Vettese says his analysis shows even the lower figures are too high. ""In the case of the typical middle-income household that paid off a mortgage, raised children and made the usual payroll deductions, the real target is closer to 50 percent,"" he said. Although those who disregard the retirement-crisis warnings can muster great assurance and quantities of data and analysis to support their views, crisis defenders are also well equipped with stats. ""It's as serious as it could be,"" said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, which produces regular reports on the topic. Munnell says poverty is a poor benchmark and that a better one would measure the degree to which retirement will mean a less comfortable lifestyle. ""About half of today's working-age households are at risk of not being able to maintain their standard of living in retirement,"" Munnell noted. Munnell says two powerful factors drive the shortfall. ""First, people will need more retirement income in the future because we are living longer, retiree health-care costs continue to grow rapidly, and interest rates remain low,"" she said. ""Second, people will have less from traditional sources."" Social Security benefits have already been effectively cut by raising the full retirement age to 67 from 65, she explained, and few workers today can join defined-benefit pension plans. Munnell suggests falling post-retirement spending such as Vettese describes occurs because retirees can't afford to spend more. ""While it is true that spending declines as people age, this pattern may simply track declining income rather than an actual preference,"" she said. Also sounding the crisis alarm is Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School in New York and author of How to Retire with Enough Money. Ghilarducci says the real crisis is one of downward mobility, not poverty. ""Members of the middle class will experience downward mobility and end up in near poverty in retirement,"" she said. Only a minority of ""independent and rigorous"" researchers consider that retirement savings are adequate, Ghilarducci explained. ""Most scholars do not think so,"" she said, pointing to the 2015 GAO report that examined a number of efforts to research whether Americans have saved enough for retirement. ""The studies generally found about one-third to two-thirds of workers are at risk of falling short of this target."" Both sides believe some of the problems around the reporting of the retirement crisis derive from profit-motivated financial firms and credulous financial journalists. They are the source of the viewpoints they disagree with. ""All these vendors make a lot of money when they say there's a crisis and we'll help you get out of it,"" Ghilarducci said. Biggs at the American Enterprise Institute agrees. ""What is the chance that a company that makes its business by selling retirement savings products is going to tell you that you're saving too much for retirement?"" he said. ""They're not lying."" He added, ""They believe in their product. But people are credulous about this, particularly in the media.""

310,"Kevin Johnson, Jilly Stephens and Diana Aviv",7062017,CNBC,6292017,"The United States is a nation built on the values of equal opportunity, hard work and self-determination. It prides itself on the belief that in this land of opportunity any woman, man and child should be able to reach their full potential. The challenge is to create the environment in which people can thrive. That includes a strong social compact in which government, business and the social (non-profit) sector invest in the well-being of individuals and families and ensure pathways to opportunity and success. At the most basic level that begins with ensuring access to life's basic needs, including quality, affordable food. Sadly, this is not the reality for all too many Americans. Despite their best efforts, millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Many people across the country are working two or even three jobs to put food on the tables and keep a roof over their heads. A report supported by City Harvest found that, in New York City alone, over 2.7 million men, women and children face hunger. Across the United States, 42 million people are ""food insecure"" — meaning that they don't know with certainty where their next meal will come from, if at all. That includes more than 13 million children in the U.S. who live in food insecure households. Good nutrition is vital for their health and cognitive development, and needed for each child to reach his or her full potential. The coming months are especially challenging, as only one in six of the millions of children who are eligible for free or reduced-priced meals at school receive that benefit over the summer. The proposed federal budget calls for dramatic cuts to similar social programs that help the most vulnerable people in our nation. For example, potential cuts of $193 billion to SNAP (formerly food stamps) will deeply impact the 43 million women, children, men and seniors the program currently serves. With so many pressing issues at stake, we cannot lose sight of ensuring our neighbors aren't facing one of the worst uncertainties imaginable – not knowing if they will have enough food to eat. It is times like these when we need the private and social sectors to stand together to help our most vulnerable kids and their families. That is why Starbucks and other businesses are partnering with Feeding America® — and its nationwide network of food banks and food rescue organizations, including City Harvest — to create programs like FoodShare. The program has set a goal to eliminate any potential food waste by rescuing 100 percent of available-to-donate food from their U.S. stores and getting it in the hands of the millions of New Yorkers and Americans who are facing hunger. Food insecurity prevents the young girl in Harlem from focusing in school because of an empty stomach; causes the young mother in San Antonio to miss multiple meals in order to feed her child; and forces the grandfather in Chicago to scrape by to pay for medicine, which he prioritizes ahead of his next meal. Communities, families and children cannot thrive on empty stomachs. We must continue to ensure that people have access to nutritious meals that give them the fuel they need to thrive. We need the commitment of our friends, families and neighbors to support one another in good times and bad, and be willing to share not only our food but also the American dream.

312,Rebecca Ungarino,7062017,CNBC,6292017,"As technology stocks dive and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is set to log its first monthly loss since October, some strategists are forecasting further weakness for technology in the near term — with an upward resumption further out. ""The sector is in for what I call an intermediate-term correction,"" Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""That is not the end of the world,"" Sluymer said. ""It doesn't mean that you have to sell all of the tech stocks that you own, but when you look at the very long-term for tech, from a technical standpoint, technology has run to the upper end of a very long-term trend line that goes all the way back to 2009.""  Examining a chart of the S&P 500 information technology sector and its 40-week moving average advancing within a channel he highlighted back to the beginning of 2009, Sluymer pointed out that it may consolidate around its current levels. However, he believes its recent movement suggests a pullback is ahead. As several technology heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Netflix and Apple have already fallen below their 50-day moving averages, Sluymer predicted many names in the tech space could see a correction of 10 to 15 percent from here. ""That only takes it down to the 200-day moving average, which is really nothing substantial from the point of investing,"" he said, adding the long-term trend is still upward, and he would buy the names in an uptrend, but ""now is not the time."" The technology sector is still the best-performing sector year to date, with health care a close second. Tech is due for further consolidation at this juncture, said Max Wolff, 55 Institutional market strategist. However, he likes the group in the long term, as he sees potential for growth. ""The overall market is way out over its skis from a historical basis, an average basis, a multiple basis, a duration of gain basis, a duration of expansion basis,"" Wolff said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""But one thing we know as a perennial winner is to bet on abnormal profitability and/or abnormal growth, and we're seeing a good bit of both in the tech space.""  ""The portion of the economy that is tech, one way or another, whether it is [artificial intelligence] or changes in entertainment, or changes in manufacturing, continues to grow,"" he said, adding that technology is indeed overbought, ""and the only caveat we would add to that is, so is everything else."" For the setup to a trade he planned to execute Thursday, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon said he would bet against Apple amid the current struggling tech space. He pointed out that the $143 stock has fallen into a consolidation around the mid-$140's area, and has been unable to retake the high of $155.98 it reached in early June.

Social stocks have gotten slammed, but one has survived the social media meltdown: Twitter. The charts could be setting up for an even bigger pop for the social network. The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter. Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Michael Bapis of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management discuss whether the stock is a social safety trade. Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global says a North Korean attack, should one occur, isn't likely to cause significant long-term market impact.

313,Fred Imbert,7062017,CNBC,6292017,"U.S. stocks closed lower Thursday as technology stocks declined amid a rise in global bond yields. Oil prices settled 0.9 percent higher at $45.52 a barrel after earlier rising more than 2 percent. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported U.S. commercial crude inventories fell by a more-than-expected 6.3 million barrels in the week through June 30. Energy ended 1.8 percent lower as the second-worst performer in the S&P 500. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the session 158.1 points lower at 21,320.04. UnitedHealth, Walt Disney, 3M and Apple had the greatest negative impact on the index. The Nasdaq composite closed 1 percent lower at 6,089.46. The S&P 500 finished Thursday down 0.4 percent at 2,409.75. Earlier, the major indexes pared losses in midday trade. Tech trimmed losses from an earlier decline of more than 1 percent to close 0.8 percent lower. ""Tech has recovered. You've seen German 10-year bund yields and U.S. Treasury yields kind of steady here. They're not going anywhere,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. There's a ""comfort of yields steadying, allowing tech to recover."" Global sovereign bond yields held higher. The 10-year German Bund yield broke above 0.50 percent for the first time since January 2016 and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.38 percent. Julian Emanuel, UBS equity and derivatives strategist, said in a note Wednesday that higher yields could present a problem for tech stocks near-term. Higher yields ""will require superior earnings reports to halt the slide – the 'Summer Squall' for Tech and the 'Summer Stall' for the broad market could continue through July,"" he said. Shares of Facebook, Tesla, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet all traded lower, pushing the Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLK) down by 0.9 percent. Tesla shares fell 5.5 percent Thursday, sending shares down 20 percent from a recent high, or into bear market territory. In the last two days a slew of analysts, including ones from Goldman Sachs and Bernstein, said in notes that Tesla's second-quarter delivery results disappointed them. Tech — this year's best-performing sector coming into Thursday's session — has been sputtering lately, falling 4 percent over the past month. The sector was also on track for its fourth losing session in five and has been plagued by valuation concerns. That said, the sector's pullback should be short-lived, said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. ""Valuations are rich, but if think more money is going into these companies, then you're going to buy them anyway,"" she said. Bond prices have been falling as major central banks have adopted more hawkish rhetoric, especially from the European Central Bank. Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi said the European economy was ""strengthening and broadening,"" adding ""the threat of deflation is gone and reflationary forces are at play."" ""If Draghi hadn't spoken, yields globally would probably be unchanged,"" said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at Silicon Valley Bank. ""The market is basically looking down the road and realizing that this low-rate environment we're used to may not be ending, but [central banks] are definitely taking their foot off the pedal."" Minutes from the ECB's June meeting released Thursday also showed officials discussed shifting their bias from easing to neutral, helping yields in the region rise and drag their U.S. counterparts higher. ""There's a good analogy between what's happening right now in the German bond market and what happened in the U.S. bond market back in 2013,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, referring to the so-called Taper Tantrum. Investors in the U.S. also focused on a series of economic data releases. First, a report from ADP and Moody's Analytics showed the U.S. economy added 158,000 jobs last month, less than the expected 185,000. The report usually serves as a warm-up act for the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report, which is set for release Friday. ""When we get to the level of employment that we have, ... you'd expect the pace of jobs creation to slow down,"" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank. ""What we're looking for is how does that relate to inflation."" Weekly jobless claims, meanwhile, came in at 248,000, slightly higher than the expected 243,000. Other data released included the IHS Markit services PMI for June, which showed the strongest expansion in business activity since January, and the ISM nonmanufacturing index, which rose to 57.4 in June from 56.9 in May. Gold futures for August delivery rose $1.60 to $1,223.30 an ounce. The U.S. dollar index traded about half a percent lower, with the euro near $1.14 and the yen around 113.33 against the dollar. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 12.60, near its highest since June 29. About five stocks declined for every advancer on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 877.77 million and a composite volume of 3.353 billion at the close.

314,Dan Mangan,7062017,CNBC,6292017,"""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli, during a surprise visit with reporters covering his fraud trial Friday, criticized the people prosecuting him as the ""junior varsity,"" claimed he never considered taking a plea deal and said people ""blame me for everything."" Shkreli also griped about news headlines regarding his case, and teed off on a young woman who had testified he for almost a year dragged out redeeming her $435,000 investment in his hedge fund, saying she wasn't a ""victim."" And Shrkreli said that several documents discussed at the trial, which raised questions about his honesty with investors, were prepared by other people. ""Do I want to exonerate myself?"" he asked a small group of journalists when asked if he had desired to have his day in court. ""Yes."" He only stopped talking and left when his high-powered lawyer Benjamin Brafman  peered in the room and asked, ""Martin, can I talk to you for a minute?"" Later, Brafman said would prefer Shkreli not conduct any more impromptu press conferences ""because sometimes he doesn't have a filter."" ""I'm hoping he doesn't do it ever again,"" Brafman told reporters. Tweet At the end of the day's session, before leaving court, Shkreli told one reporter ""I have to be very careful about who I talk to. I might get into trouble."" And Shkreli said to a sketch artist, ""You're talking to 'Rain Man.' I remember everything."" The ""Rain Man"" reference was to Brafman's blistering opening argument, during which he said Shkreli's business colleagues used the name of that Tom Cruise movie behind his back because it featured an autistic savant, played by Dustin Hoffman. Those colleagues supposedly suspected the highly intelligent Shkreli also might be autistic. Shkreli's unexpected remarks came during the lunch break of his securities fraud trial in Brooklyn, NY, federal court. He is charged with looting millions of dollars from Retrophin, the publicly traded drug company he founded. Prosecutors claim he used the money to repay to investors whom allegedly defrauded at two hedge funds he had run, in addition to paying off personal debts. Shkreli walked into a courtroom that is on the same floor as the one where his trial is being conducted, and saw several reporters. The room has an video and audio feed of the trial for spectators who don't have seats in the main courtroom. ""Welcome,"" one reporter said when she saw Shkreli. The 34-year former pharmaceuticals executive then began talking freely for about five minutes. Shkreli first mentioned that a friend of his had been in the the trial's so-called ""overflow"" room earlier in the week, and tried to sit on the judge's bench. When a reporter asked Shkreli what he thought of the trial's opening arguments on Wednesday, he shot back, ""How do you think they went?"" Shkreli then suggested that his lawyer Brafman, who gave an impassioned opening, had far outclassed assistant United States Attorney G. Karthik Srinivasan, who argument was more workman-like. Shkreli several times mentioned that Srinivasan had joined the prosecutor's office in the Eastern District of New York only two years ago. He also pointed out that Srinivasan before that had been an associate at the Manhattan law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind. When a CNBC reporter noted that the Eastern District is a well-regarded prosecutors' office, one which as late as 2015 had been led by former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Shkreli scoffed. He then called the Eastern District the ""junior varsity."" There is a long-standing intramural rivalry between the U.S. Attorney's Office for Eastern District of New York — which encompasses Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island — and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, whose ambit includes Manhattan and its Financial District. In New York's legal world, many see the Southern District as the more elite of the two, a fact that Shkreli seemed keenly aware of. John Marzulli, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District, declined to comment on Shkreli's scornful remarks. Shkreli also suggested that Winston Paes, who had been  the lead prosecutor in the case, chickened out of taking it trial, because he had accepted a job several months at the large Manhattan firm Debevoise & Plimpton. ""Why would you walk out on the biggest case of your life?"" Shkreli asked. Paes, through a colleague, declined to comment to CNBC. Asked if he thought Brafman's opening argument was worth $4 million that has supposedly been paid to that attorney's law firm, Shkreli disputed the accuracy of that amount. He also said the reporter who asked about it always gets facts wrong. But a 10-Q filing in May by Retrophin, which ousted Shkreli in 2014, says he claimed the company owed him $5 million in legal expenses that he had incurred in defending both the criminal case and a related civil case by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Retrophin, according to the company's filings, to date has advanced $2.8 million in pre-trial fees for Shkreli's lawyers, and $2 million in trial fees, for a total of $4.8 million. At the same time, Retrophin is suing Shkreli for allegedly ripping off the company, is and cooperating with federal authorities in their cases against him. Brafman, during a hearing last week, said his firm has been paid $800,000 less than the $4.8 million tally. The difference between the two amounts is $4 million. Shkreli on Friday said he thought the trial, which was in its third day since jurors were seated, was going well for the defense. But he bemoaned the headlines about the testimony of Sarah Hassan, who invested $300,000 of her own money in his hedge fund in 2011. Shkreli complained that those headlines did not highlight the fact that she  ended up getting a total of $1.3 million in cash combined with the proceeds of sales of Retrophin stock given her. Her own family's hedge fund, which she manages, netted even more from selling Retrophin stock it had acquired as a result of an initial $125,000 stake in the company. ""How can a victim make $2.7 million?"" Shkreli asked. ""She's not a victim."" But Hassan had testified that Shkreki for almost a year stalled in redeeming her personal investment stake — which he claimed had grown to $435,000 —  after she asked to be paid out upon learning he was closing that MSMB Capital. She also said Shkreli surprised her by telling her that he had, without getting her permission, used her personal money at MSMB to capitalize the start up of Retrophin. Shkreli told reporters Friday that he believed jurors were most impressed not by Hassan's complaints about the long delay in getting her money, but by the fact that she made ""four times"" her investment. ""I made nothing"" from MSMB Capital, Shkreli added. ""They blame me for everything,"" Shkreli said, apparently referring to prosecutors and his other critics. ""Blame me for capitalism,"" Shkreli said. ""Blame me for EpiPen."" Several prospective jurors earlier this week were excused from consideration because they incorrectly believed Shkreli had raised the price of the anti-allergy device EpiPen. In reality, Shkreli drew widespread public scorn in 2015 for hiking the price of an anti-parasite drug named Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent while serving as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli also told reporters that he did not prepare tax documents or Retrophin marketing documents that Hassan testified about on Thursday. Other people did that, he said. Hassan had testifed that Shkreli dragged his feet in giving her tax documents related to her investment in his hedge fund, and that when she received them they mistakenly listed her father's name as part of the investment. Fred Hassan, her dad and a well-known pharma executive, also was listed as a member of Retrophin's board of directors on a pitch presentation assembled when the company was being created, Sarah Hassan said. Fred Hassan said he never invested in Shkreli's hedge fund, nor did he have any role as a director, adviser or investor in Retrophin. Instead, Hassan and his daughter testified,  Sarah Hassan invested $125,000 from the family's own hedge fund, DynaGrow, in Retrophin. More than 90 percent of DynaGrow's assets belongs to Fred Hassan and his wife. Shkreli played coy and declined to answer a reporter when asked if prosecutors had offered him a plea deal. But he noted that most federal criminal defendant plead guilty instead of going to trial. When asked directly if he had turned down any offer from prosecutors, which likely would have included a reduction in the number of criminal counts he would have pleaded guilty to, Shkreli said he had. Brafman, Shkreli's lawyer, told CNBC as he walked outside of court at the end of the day, ""I really think Martin is not going to be speaking to you guys again if he listens to me."" ""I don't think anything Martin says by now is going to affect the case one way or the other, but I would very much appreciate it if he did not talk to the press because sometimes he doesn't have a filter,"" said Brafman. As Bradfman spoke, Shkreli walked by his side, grinning broadly. ",Shkreli blasts prosecutors as 'junior varsity' to reporters,-0.7005

The president of Empire Executions has been shorting the market, and now he's ""almost thinking of doubling down."" ""You've had this move, and it's been nonstop,"" Costa told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Friday. ""There's going to be an inflection point, and I think it's coming up fairly soon."" U.S. equities closed mostly higher on Friday. The Nasdaq, which closed just below breakeven, posted its largest first-half gains since 2009. Costa believes people aren't paying attention to the ""big morass of problems"" in Washington, D.C., which he said will trickle down into the equity markets. While Costa has been betting against the stock market this year, it has continued to climb. He admitted there may come a point where he'll have to ""throw in the towel,"" like if he sees second-quarter earnings ""getting better and better."" ""We'll wait until … the end of the summer and see what happens there. By that time I'll either be broke or I'll ... be right,"" he said. Meanwhile, Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic, believes ""there is a lot of value out there."" He likes financials, oils and energy infrastructure. He's also a big fan of Apple, which, he notes, when you strip out the cash is selling at a 15 price-earnings ratio. That's a ""tremendous bargain"" for a brand that ""can mint revenue,"" Cordaro said. For ""Shark Tank"" host Kevin O'Leary, holding positions internationally is a must. ""There are many, many good European companies trading at significant discounts to their equivalents in the S&P 500,"" the chairman of O'Shares ETFs said in an interview with ""Closing Bell."" For instance, he owns Anheuser-Busch. ""I'm staying in Europe forever with 20 percent of the portfolio. I'm staying international with 20 percent because I've just looked and realized I can never guess over the last 40 years when to be in or out of those Asian or European markets,"" O'Leary added. Fred Lane, on the other hand, is sticking to domestic stocks. While he agrees that valuations are cheaper overseas right now, he has a long-term orientation and is discouraged by Europe. ""When I look at Europe I see declining populations, I see very poor demographics, I see even higher level of entitlements than we have here in the United States [and] I think lower levels of productivity,"" the managing partner at Lane Generational of Raymond James told ""Closing Bell.""

316, ,7062017,CNBC,6292017,"The world's top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers' knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain's Smith & Nephew believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. ""The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,"" he said. ""It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren't as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement."" Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker's joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew's products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company's most important strategic investment for a decade. ""We are now basically head to head with Stryker,"" he said in an interview. ""I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it's Stryker or us."" Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. ""As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,"" Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. ""Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven't been specific about."" Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France's Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew's Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. ""I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question."" ",Robot wars: Knee surgery marks new battleground for companies,0.9982

In the words of President Donald Trump, ""Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated."" Trump's surprise victory in November, coupled with Republicans retaining a majority of seats in the House and Senate, was expected to clear a path for a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the hallmark health bill of Barack Obama's presidency that's often called Obamacare. However, Republicans have struggled at every turn to pass a replacement bill. Image source: President Donald J. Trump's official Facebook page. Photo by Shealah Craighead. In March, the House GOP introduced the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which received scathing reviews from Democrats, much of the public, and even some members of its own party. The initial version of the AHCA never even went to vote. A second version, brought to the House floor a little less than two months later, wound up adding a few new amendments and passed by the narrowest of margins. Nonetheless, the AHCA was highly unpopular with the public, and it was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that the AHCA would lead to 23 million people losing their health insurance within a decade. The latest plan, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) from the Senate Republicans, takes bits and pieces from the AHCA and Obamacare and attempts to blend them together. Like the initial version of the AHCA, it currently is lacking the support for passage, meaning the GOP's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare could be drawn out for many weeks and months to come. Interestingly enough, though, a solution may exist right under their noses. Namely, they could choose to leave Obamacare in place and simply fix the aspects of the law that are broken. It would mean swallowing a bit of hubris on the GOP's part, but it could resolve many of Obamacare's issues without leading to 22 million or 23 million people losing their access to affordable health insurance over the next decade. What's wrong with Obamacare, you ask? For starters, premium inflation is accelerating at a much faster pace than anyone imagined. This appears to be a result of national insurers dropping coverage in a number of markets. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurance provider in the nation, reduced its coverage in 2017 to just three states from 34 states in 2016. The move was made after UnitedHealth's management cited years of unsustainable losses derived from Obamacare plans. Similar moves were made by Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which reduced their county-based coverage by nearly 70% and almost 90%, respectively. Humana even went a step further and announced its intent to withdraw from the ACA marketplaces completely by 2018. Image source: Getty Images. On top of fewer national insurers, around three-quarters of Obamacare's 23 approved healthcare cooperative shuttered their doors due to financial instability. The lack of low-cost options in the marketplace is one reason why the average benchmark premium (the second-lowest cost silver plan in each state) for the 39 states covered by federally run HealthCare.gov rose 25% in 2017. The failure of the risk corridor was another massive disappointment for Obamacare. The risk corridor program, in its simplest form, was designed to take money from overly profitable insurers and distribute it to those who were losing money because they priced their premiums too low. Unfortunately, the risk corridor was chronically underfunded, because there were never that many profitable insurers within the ACA. The lack of a functioning risk corridor kept new insurers looking to expand their plan offerings out of the market. Lastly, we can certainly place some onus on the adverse selection insurers had to contend with. Adverse selection describes the process whereby insurers enroll a disproportionate number of sicker patients than healthy patients. Because the ACA didn't allow insurers to turn away patients with pre-existing conditions, it meant they had to accept people who, prior to Obamacare's passage, weren't able to get insurance (at least for a reasonable price). This adverse selection, coupled with poor healthy adult enrollment and overzealous enrollment estimates from the CBO, made life very difficult for insurers. Fixing Obamacare, however, wouldn't be as impossible as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill would make it seem. Here are three solutions to fix some of Obamacare biggest problems. Image source: Getty Images. Pretty much the biggest core issue with Obamacare is that there are too many sick people enrolling and not enough healthy people. This means insurers are seeing their medical expense ratios skyrocket, and they're reducing their coverage as a result. Why aren't enough healthy young adults enrolling? The answer is pretty simple: They're being financially savvy by sticking to the sidelines. Data from HealthPocket shows that an unsubsidized bronze plan would run close to $311 a month in 2017, or around $3,700 a year. Sticking to the sidelines if you're a healthy individual who doesn't go to the doctor would save you $2,700 -- and that's assuming you pay the SRP. The Internal Revenue Service can't garnish wages, seize property, or even turn away federal tax returns if line 61 (the line where SRP payments are reported) isn't filled in. The solution, while certainly unpopular, would bring more healthy young people into the system and help provide some sorely needed premium revenue for insurers: Raise the SRP penalty to the match the cost of the lowest-cost bronze plan in each state. This would provide the incentive for young adults to enroll since purchasing a health plan would at least provide them with benefits. There'd be obvious pushback among young adults, but their enrollment is vital to Obamacare's success. Image source: Getty Images. An arguably easier fix for Obamacare would be to provide more power to each state's Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). Each state's OIC is responsible for analyzing why an insurance company has requested a 10% or greater increase or decrease in premiums on a year-over-year basis. In theory, OIC's are designed to be the bargaining tool between the insurance company and the consumer, with the OIC doing its best to haggle prices down for John and Jane Q. Public. The key phrase in the previous sentence being ""in theory."" In reality, OIC's have been blown over by even the slightest breeze from the insurance industry. The issue being that OIC's have no real power to mandate health plan pricing from insurance companies. They can make suggestions, but if an insurance company can provide justification that its premiums need to head higher by 30%, 40%, or 50% year over year because of ongoing losses, OIC's have little recourse other than to stand by and watch it happen. The fix? Put some meat on the OIC's bones. Give each state's OIC some power to actually negotiate with insurance companies instead of merely offering suggestions from the balcony. Given the inherent advantages drug companies enjoy in America, it's not as if we're going to see premium inflation grind to a halt, but putting some power into the hands of the OIC could chop off a few percentage points of premium inflation annually, in my opinion. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, Republicans should consider finding a way to reinstitute the risk corridor to encourage health insurers to reenter the marketplace. In 2014, some $2.87 billion in funds was requested by money-losing insurers via the risk corridor program, but only $362 million was paid to these insurers. If the SRP were amended to coerce more young adults to enroll, presumably more insurers would be profitable and the risk corridor would be fully funded. But even if the risk corridor were still short on funding, if the federal government stepped in to cover any shortage, the corresponding payments to money-losing insurers should prop them up long enough to adjust their premiums to sustainable levels and encourage more competition, ultimately pushing premium inflation down and possibly reducing the uninsured rate. In other words, providing federal funding to the risk corridor, if need be, could be a short-term cost that leads to a number of long-term positives. At the same time, the federal government could dangle a carrot to insurers that only allows them to participate in more populated markets if they also choose a lesser-populated market to provide coverage. This would be a means of encouraging competition in more rural communities, which in turn should make premiums more affordable for the average American. Some of these measures wouldn't be popular, but neither was Obamacare when it first rolled out. However, if the SRP were amended, the OIC's given greater power to negotiate, and the risk corridor reintroduced, we could see a sustainable insurance market and tamer premium inflation. But that's just one Fool's opinion. ","

Chen announced via LinkedIn last week that she was leaving her role consulting to the department’s prosecutors on cases involving corporate ethics and compliance crimes. In her post entitled “Mission Matters,” Chen said that she felt like a hypocrite as she sat with companies accused of ethics and compliance violations. Chen wrote that on her mind “were the numerous lawsuits pending against the President of the United States for everything from violations of the Constitution to conflict of interest, the ongoing investigations of potentially treasonous conducts, and the investigators and prosecutors fired for their pursuits of principles and facts. Those are conducts I would not tolerate seeing in a company, yet I worked under an administration that engaged in exactly those conducts. I wanted no more part in it.” Chen had previously poked at President Trump on Twitter. Matt Kelly, founder and editor of the blog Radical Compliance, has been following this story for a while and produced a podcast interview with Chen last Friday. “I’ve talked with many compliance professionals of all political persuasions and they are challenged to explain the importance of good ethical conduct to executives in their companies,” Kelly told MarketWatch. “How can they when it doesn’t seem to matter to the President? None of the concerns about Trump’s behavior Chen details in her post would fly in any corporate environment.” Chen also wrote that she was “persistently prohibited” from being the one to speak publicly about a key document she produced for the DOJ’s use, “Evaluations of Corporate Compliance.” She watched “almost everyone except me being able to talk about (and often misinterpreting) my work,” she wrote in the LinkedIn post. Chen says she will continue to engage publicly, now that she is free do so, via public speaking, writing, and consulting. She also plans to work for candidates who “want to restore the notions of integrity, decency, and intellect back into our government.” Chen provided guidance and training to U.S. federal prosecutors on how to verify and evaluate compliance programs that companies implemented after being caught engaging in potentially illegal conduct that raised the possibility of criminal charges. She’s had plenty of experience doing that. She began her career at the Justice Department, spending six years as a trial attorney and then an assistant U.S. attorney. She was previously responsible for global management of antibribery and corruption compliance at Standard Chartered Bank

321,Alessandra Malito,7062017,MarketWatch,6292017,"Published: July 4, 2017 4:04 p.m. ET People will eat more than twice the amount of beef than chicken By What is the Fourth of July without hamburgers and barbecued chicken? Americans stocked up on plenty of meats in the two weeks before Independence Day last year, according to market-research group Nielsen. People spent more than $800 million on beef during the two weeks leading up to the July 4 weekend, followed by $371 million on chicken and $218 million on pork. Shrimp ($85 million) and salmon ($48 million) also made the chart. One reason: beef is cheap, at least compared to previous July 4 weekends. Retail prices for ground beef have fallen to $3.56 per pound in May this year, compared with $4.14 in May 2015, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Chicken legs dropped to $1.45 per pound and pork chops $3.43 per pound, compared to $1.55 and $3.79, respectively, two years earlier. See: Tastes like chicken? Lab-grown ‘clean meat’ wins taste-testers’ approval Along with their meat, Americans also favored barbecue sauce more than any other meat-topping sauce, though popularity and sales are growing for Worcestershire and teriyaki sauces, Nielsen showed. Barbecue sauce sales were $43.8 million in that two-week period, significantly more than any other sauce, but only 2.7% dollar percent from the year before. Meanwhile, Worcestershire sauce grew 9.8% and teriyaki sauce 7.7% from the prior year, with hot sauce in third place at 5.8%. There are more meat lovers than vegetarians in the U.S., with the average American eating about 193 pounds of beef, pork and/or chicken a year compared to 3% of Americans who say they follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. In fact, Americans are consuming more meat now than they did in 2012, when the average was 184 pounds a year. Red meat has its risks. One study suggests eating red meat on a regular basis can shorten a person’s lifespan, according to the National Institutes of Health, and other research found red meat is linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. While studying 37,000 men beginning in 1986 and 83,000 women in 1980, with checkups every two years and a food frequency questionnaire for participants to fill out every four years, a team of researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health found 5,900 had died from cardiovascular disease and 9,500 from cancer and those who had consumed the most red meat were at the highest risk for mortality. Researchers found an additional serving of unprocessed red meat during the study raised the mortality risk total by 13%, and an extra serving of processed red meat raised it by 20%. The study suggests substituting one serving per day of another protein would lower the risk of mortality from 7% to 19%. See also: In high demand: World Series tickets and T-shirts — also: goat meat Some studies counter the argument that red meat is dangerous, however, and experts say it doesn’t necessarily lead to health problems (or worse) if you consume it in moderation. The type of meat, size of the slab and the temperature at which it is cooked also contribute to the quality and safety of consumption. Meat should not be processed — so perhaps cut down on the bacon — and be mindful of how much to consume; 100 grams (or the size of a deck of playing cards) every day was attributed to a 17% rise in cancer risk. It should also be cooked at less-than-high temperatures, since searing has been linked to causing cancer because, according to one theory, the high temperatures change the meat’s DNA.

It was the latest in a series of hostile tweets over the past week attacking what Trump called the “fake and fraudulent news media,” including the hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and CNN, which on Saturday he called “FraudNewsCNN.” #FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg In a statement Sunday, CNN said it was a “sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.” “Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, ‎dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office,” CNN said. The network also called out the White House’s deputy press secretary, who said earlier this week that “the president in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.” “Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied,” CNN said. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press joined the fray. “We condemn the president’s threat of physical violence against journalists,” the advocacy group said in a statement. Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert denied Trump’s tweet was a threat. “No one would perceive that as a threat,” he said. “I’m proud of the president for developing a Twitter and a social-media platform where he can talk directly to the American people.” Encouraging violence toward journalists, though, is no joke. Just last month, Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte pleaded guilty to assaulting a reporter a day before a special election in May. CNN commentator and Republican strategist Ana Navarro told ABC News that Trump was inciting violence. “He is going to get somebody killed in the media,” she said. Congressional Democrats also condemned Trump’s tweet, with Rep. Ted Lieu, from Southern California, calling it “beyond unacceptable.” OMG, @realDonaldTrump is now encouraging violence against the media. He has violence and blood in his mind.

325,,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"(This version of the July 11 story corrects title of Larsen to Ping An group’s chief innovation officer, not chief technology officer, in second paragraph) By Kane Wu and Julie  Zhu HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ping An Insurance Group Ltd, China’s largest insurer by market value, is scouting for fintech and healthcare assets in the United States, Israel and Singapore, as it looks to use a $1 billion investment fund, a company executive said. The Shenzhen-based insurer plans to use the acquired technology and know-how to grow its business in China, Jonathan Larsen, Ping An Group’s chief innovation officer and chairman of the fund, told Reuters on Tuesday. “The primary rationale for the fund is strategic...to find capabilities, ideas, business models and technologies that can be valuable to Ping An,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Ping An launched the Hong Kong-based Global Voyager Fund in early May as the sole investor, but did not give details of which type of start-up companies it wanted to buy, or where it would look for assets. The fund will allocate 30 percent of the capital to growth companies that are at least three years old and have been through the early-stage challenges, with a single investment size of $10 million to $30 million, Larsen said. Another 30 percent will be deployed to bigger firms with a single investment size of between $30 million and $100 million, while a further eight to 10 percent will be invested in early-stage companies via partner funds. The rest will be used for special investment opportunities such as buyouts, said Larsen, formerly the global head of retail banking and mortgages at Citigroup, who joined Ping An in May. He added that although Ping An’s customer franchise is overwhelmingly Chinese, the group may follow in the footsteps of the country’s largest financial institutions. “We are at a point where we can very selectively contemplate international opportunities. And the fund could play a role in that mostly through partnerships,” he said. ","

326, ,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"TOBACCO TITAN: A cigarette vending machine near the offices of Philip Morris International in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company, which sells Marlboro, is targeting the FCTC anti-smoking treaty on multiple levels. REUTERS/Paritosh Bansal The worldâs largest publicly traded tobacco company is deploying its vast resources against international efforts to reduce smoking. Internal documents uncovered by Reuters reveal details of the secret operation. By ADITYA KALRA, PARITOSH BANSAL, DUFF WILSON and TOM LASSETER Filed July 13, 2017, 11:15 a.m. GMT NEW DELHI/LAUSANNE, SwitzerlandÂ â A group of cigarette company executives stood in the lobby of a drab convention center near New Delhi last November. They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organizationâs global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didnât want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and British American Tobacco Plc. There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc. A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didnât turn up Â because the company knew it wasnât welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. Related content Part 2: Marlboro Country Archive: The Philip Morris Files Graphic: Lobbying strategy Graphic: Watering down Video: A âreal dangerâ The object of these clandestine activities: the WHOâs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a âregulatory runaway trainâ driven by âanti-tobacco extremistsâ â a description contained in the document,Â a 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â Â Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the worldâs tobacco control treaty. Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. Reuters uncovered thousands of pages of internal Philip Morris International documents. These excerpts show the companyâs tactics for combating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking worldwide. (Some documents include highlighting by Reuters; some names have been redacted.) 1. A slide from a 2014 Philip Morris corporate affairs presentationÂ about the FCTC, the global anti-smoking treaty. CoP5 and CoP6 refer to the biennial meetings of treaty nations in 2012 and 2014. âENDSâ refers to e-cigarettes.Â 2. Another slide from the 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â âParadigm shiftâ refers to an expected boom in what the company calls âreduced-risk products.â 3. A slide from the 2014 presentation shows Philip Morris plans for tracking anti-smoking groups, which the company callsÂ anti-tobacco organizations, or ATOs. 4. The same 2014 document shows objectives for corporate affairs executives. âRoadblocksâ refers to delays in implementing anti-smoking steps. âMoHâ refers to ministries of health. 5. Another slide from the 2014 document shows the characteristics that a Philip Morris corporate affairs (âCAâ) personÂ should possess. 6. A more detailed account of Philip Morrisâ corporate affairs tactics from the same 2014 presentation. 7. A list of methods the company has devised for opposing the implementation of plain packaging, a measure advocated by the FCTCÂ that bars the use of logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. 8. This slide from the 2014 presentation shows some of the resources Philip Morris deployed at the FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow that year (CoP6), as the company looked ahead to the 2016 session in New Delhi (CoP7). ITGA = the International Tobacco Growersâ Association. 9. Philip Morris pushes for more delegates to FCTC treaty meetings from government agencies that deal with economic and trade issues. This slide from the 2014 presentation shows the companyâs plan to lobby for more delegates from outside of public health on Indiaâs delegation at the treaty meeting last year. 10. Excerpt from an October 18, 2014, email from Chris Koddermann, who led the Philip Morris team at the treaty meeting in Moscow that year. (full email) 11. An October 18, 2014, email from Nguyen Thanh Ky, a Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, about his meeting with the Vietnamese delegation to the 2014 Moscow treaty conference. 12. Excerpt from an October 2014 email from Gustavo Bosio, then Philip Morris manager for international trade, a few days after the end of the Moscow meeting. (full email) 13. Excerpt from a Philip Morris briefing paper on trade arguments, ahead of the treaty meeting in India last year. The company has long argued that the biennial Conference of the Parties (COP) should leave trade issues to the World Trade Organization (WTO).Â 14. Excerpt from a Philip Morris briefing paper on potential risks ahead of the treaty meeting last year, âCOP7â in India. ENDS, or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems, refers to electronic cigarettes. 15. Excerpt from a 2011 draft Philip Morris plan for responding to moves in Israel to pass new anti-smoking measures. 16. In this slide from a Japan corporate affairs presentation, some ministers in the Japanese cabinet are identified according to their positions on tobacco. The two ministers designated âPro-tobaccoâ did not respond to questions from Reuters. 17. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, talks about Philip Morris Japan maintaining good relations with members of Japanâs FCTC delegation, and a Philip Morris executive meeting with members of the countryâs FCTC delegation. (MOF = Ministry of Finance; MOFA = Ministry of Foreign Affairs; JT = Japan Tobacco.) 18. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, reveals the companyâs plans for opposing moves in Australia to bar the use of logos or distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The measure is known as plain packaging, or PP. The Tobacco Institute of Japan, or TIOJ, declined to comment. 19. A slide from a Philip Morris training document. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. Thatâs happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTCâs biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006Â in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip MorrisÂ International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials. âAs a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,â Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statementÂ in response to Reutersâ findings. âThe fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.â In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the companyâs own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations âmake their own decisions.â âWeâre respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,â said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interviewÂ whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treatyâs biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat âno.â When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposedÂ stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death â and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC reportÂ shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16 âsubstantiveâ treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason: âThe tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.â Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier,Â studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle,â said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year. âNo way,â he said. âThe tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the worldâs biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year.Â Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representativesÂ then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry. âItâs a real war,â said da Costa e Silva. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle. No wayâ¦ The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her.Â She wasnât aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November. âThis is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,â da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents. âI think they want to implode the treaty.â The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. She was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989Â document revealed one companyâs plan to fight threats to the industry. âWHOâs impact and influence is indisputable,â the document said. It went on to contemplate âcountermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.â That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altriaâs have more than tripled. Philip Morris Internationalâs operational headquartersÂ are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-RomanÂ ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morrisâ operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a âCoordinating Roomâ that could seat 42 people, according to theÂ 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled âCorporate affairs approach and issues.â Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to âplay the political game.â Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldnât be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an emailÂ congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales.Â The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip MorrisâÂ FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. â¢ Has its roots in a small tobacconist shop in London in 1847.â¢ Now operates in more than 180 markets.â¢ Famous for its iconic Marlboro Man advertising.â¢ Has six of the worldâs top 15 cigarette brands, including Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield.â¢ Spun off from the Richmond, Va.-headquartered Altria Group in March 2008. â¢ Operational headquarters are in Switzerland.â¢ Produces over 800 billion cigarettes a year.â¢ Share price has more than doubled since the 2008 spin-off from Altria. Sources: Philip Morris International website; Reuters reporting In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to excludeÂ tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from âabusingâ trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of âthe possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.â There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as âa tremendous outcome.â Overall, the company achieved its âtrade related campaign objectives,â including âavoiding a declaration of health over tradeâ and âavoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,â he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was âto scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.â Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourageÂ the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it: âRoadblocks are as important as solutions.â One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The companyâs litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissedÂ â but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter. The attempt to undo Australiaâs regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may âmount legal challenges,â the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to âsee what happens with Australiaâs legal cases.â The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was âsignificantly watered down,â he wrote.Â âThis is a very positive result.â Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email: âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.â Philip Morris isnât alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants â Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and Imperial Brands Plc â formed an âinformal industry Working Groupâ to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to anÂ internal BAT documentÂ reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasnât been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate âto the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.â The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was âincreasingly going beyondâ its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didnât want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. The Philip Morris emails and documents donât explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as itâs known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. GuidelinesÂ that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when âstrictly necessary.â But the article â a single sentenceÂ â contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words âin accordance with national law,â opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying thatâs legal in a certain country is permissibleÂ when interacting with that countryâs representatives.Â They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. The Philip Morris International documents uncovered by Reuters include guidelines and country-specific lobbying plans aimed at hobbling the WHOâs global tobacco control treaty and national anti-smoking measures. Strategies include:â¢ Lobbying lawmakers, bureaucrats and other government officialsâ¢ Trying to move tobacco issues away from health departments â¢ Deploying third parties, including retail groups, to make its case and exert pressure on decision-makersâ¢ Engaging the media on tobacco issues and generating public debate to influence decision-makers The tabs below show the companyâs strategy in action in three countries in recent years, according to internal company documents. The extent to which Philip Morrisâ actions affected the outcome in each case is unclear. In September 2011, Israelâs health ministry proposed new measures to regulate flavoring and advertising of tobacco products. In a draft company strategy document from October 2011, Philip Morris said the proposals included âa few excessive and disproportionate measuresâ such as restricting the use of fruit or chocolate flavorings in tobacco products, and broadly prohibiting advertising and marketing of tobacco. Elements of the campaign:1:Â Leverage established relationships with different government ministries, mobilize retailers to advocate against âexcessiveâ provisions, and lobby the health ministry.2:Â Lobby the government through third parties such as an Israel-based supplier of licorice.3:Â Use Philip Morrisâ database of more than 60,000 adult smokersÂ to reach consumers and create a public debate through the media âto influence MPs,âÂ or members of parliament. OUTCOME:Â The bans on advertising and ingredients did not go through. A 2010 Philip Morris document shows the company drawing up plans to lobby Sweden in an effort to influence the European Commissionâs new tobacco regulations for member states, known as the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). Elements of the campaign:1:Â Engage the justice ministry to âput pressureâ on the health ministry so that the Swedish representativeÂ on the European Commission committee opposes plain packaging and âexcessiveâ health warning labels, and supports lifting the ban on snus, a smokeless tobacco product.2:Â Build a âbroad coalitionâ of âthird-party stakeholders,â such as the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, and get them to pressure the government. (The chamber told Reuters that it does not lobby on behalf of individual companies.)3:Â Establish a retailer network and contact bloggers and journalists to voice concerns about issues, including plain packaging and point-of-sale display bans. OUTCOME:Â Plain packaging and point-of-sale display ban were not included in the directive, which came into force in May 2014. In January 2013, Osaka Prefecture in Japan held a public consultation on a proposal to abolish existing smoking rooms, with a âroadmap towards total smoking prohibition in all public places,â according to a February 2014 Japan corporate affairs presentation.Â The Philip Morris document describes it as an âextreme proposal.â Elements of the campaign:1:Â Ensure that ârelevant stakeholdersâ oppose the move. Philip Morris field sales staff engaged retailers and others.2:Â Engage local politicians and work with the industryÂ in pushing back against the proposal. OUTCOME:Â The proposal was withdrawn. One of the companyâs targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleagueÂ Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a âdebrief lunchâ with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of âmoderate and reasonable measuresâ to be implemented over a âpractical timeline,â he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnamâs interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morrisâ positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent â something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place â including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldnât determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hourâs drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel â where Philip Morris had its operations room â and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Kyâs driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentialsÂ were checked, explaining that he was driving âVIPs,â the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnamâs delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnamâs delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew CaveÂ thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products â those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again: âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â In a subsequent email, Cave said: âRepresentatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnamâ during the Delhi conference âto discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMIâs internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.â Delegates, Cave said inÂ separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being ânamed and shamedâ by anti-smoking groups. Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but donât always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for âachieving scrutinyâ of tobacco control advocates and said a âglobal project teamâ had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morrisâ lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveniâs signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Ugandaâs lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executiveâs approach as lecturing the statesman. âHe said, âUgandan tobacco will be too expensiveâ and âit will not be competitive,ââ Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer whoâd come with him. The president then declared: âSlavery ended a long time ago.â There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didnât need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveniâs office did not respond to requests for comment. Over time, however, the industryâs lobbying has slowed the treatyâs progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes. âYou could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,â the FCTCâs da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who arenât involved in health policy. Thatâs in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns. âThe health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry itâs more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,â he said. The object of Philip Morrisâ efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to âmove tobacco issues awayâ from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play â that âitâs not about tobacco.â Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, arenât equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation. âYouâre looking at illicit trade, youâre looking at tax regimes, youâre looking at international law,â he said. âNow each of these areas, itâs logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldnât go to the health ministry.â âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnamâs delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate.Â Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isnât opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health.Â And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime ministerÂ in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they werenât, she wrote, Vietnam might be âunable to play a full part in discussions.â In 2016, VietnamÂ brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments âI havenât heard in 25 years.â A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to âthe tobacco epidemicâ from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the âNigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from [that] statement.â The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace. Just days after the FCTC conference in Moscow ended in October 2014, Philip Morris executive Gustavo Bosio sent an email to colleagues highlighting what he said was the companyâs success in pushing back on three treaty proposals related to trade issues. âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow,â wrote Bosio, then manager for international trade.

327, ,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s top medical technology companies are turning to robots to help with complex knee surgery, promising quicker procedures and better results in operations that often leave patients dissatisfied. Demand for artificial replacement joints is growing fast, as baby boomers’ knees and hips wear out, but for the past 15 years rival firms have failed to deliver a technological advance to gain them significant market share. Now U.S.-based Stryker and Britain’s Smith & Nephew  believe that is about to change, as robots give them an edge. Robots should mean less trauma to patients and faster recovery, although they still need to prove themselves in definitive clinical studies, which will not report results for a couple of years. Fares Haddad, a consultant surgeon at University College London Hospitals, is one of the first in Britain to use the new robots and has been impressed. However, he agrees healthcare providers need decisive data to prove they are worth an investment that can be as much as $1 million for each robot. “The main reason for using a robotic system is to improve precision and to be able to hit very accurately a target that varies from patient to patient,” he said. “It is particularly useful in knees because they are more problematic (than hips) and there are a chunk of patients that aren’t as satisfied as we would like with their knee replacement.” Satisfaction rates are only around 65 percent for knee operations, against 95 percent for hips, according to industry surveys. The rival types of robots vary in cost and sophistication, assisting surgeons with precision image guidance for bone cutting and the insertion of artificial joints. Orthopaedic companies hope to emulate the success of Intuitive Surgical, an early pioneer of robots in hospitals, which now has more than 4,000 of its da Vinci machines installed around the world for procedures including prostate removal, hernia repair and hysterectomies. In addition to selling into big Western markets, they also want to expand robot use in India, China and other emerging markets, where owning a prestigious high-tech system can be a marketing advantage for private hospitals. Stryker is leading the charge with its MAKO robotic arm, a platform it acquired for $1.65 billion in 2013 and which has pioneered robot-assisted whole-knee operations by determining optimal positioning and then helping with bone cutting. But it has competition from smaller rival Smith & Nephew, which last week launched a cheaper product called Navio for total knee replacements in the United States. The British group bought the company behind Navio for $275 million in 2016. That has kicked off the battle in earnest, since both companies are now able to do total knee replacements, which represent the vast majority of knee procedures. MAKO, which uses only Stryker’s joints and implants, costs around $1 million to install, while Navio, which does not have as many features and is not tied exclusively to Smith & Nephew’s products, is less than half the price. Both companies believe their robots will help them capture a bigger share of an orthopaedic market that has been split between four big players for more than a decade. Indeed, Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Olivier Bohuon said it was his company’s most important strategic investment for a decade. “We are now basically head to head with Stryker,” he said in an interview. “I do believe we are going to gain market share due to the fact we have robots, whether it’s Stryker or us.” COST-EFFECTIVENESS QUESTION Stryker, meanwhile, expects its MAKO system to start delivering market share gains from the end of 2017. “As we exit this year, we expect to start to see evidence in our knee market shares,” Katherine Owen, head of strategy at Stryker, told an investment conference in June. “Our goal with MAKO on knees is to capture hundreds of basis points of market share. What that time frame looks like, we haven’t been specific about.” Zimmer Biomet and Johnson & Johnson, the two other big players in orthopaedics, are lagging in the robotics race but both have plans to enter the area in different ways. J&J is working on surgical robotics with Verily, the life sciences arm of Google parent Alphabet, while Zimmer last year bought a majority stake in France’s Medtech, a specialist in neurosurgery. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe robots have the potential to disrupt a market in artificial joints that has arguably become commoditised, with no knee or hip implant emerging as supreme in recent years. That chimes with the view of Smith & Nephew’s Bohuon, who argues that robots give his company a chance to punch above its weight, despite ranking No. 4 in reconstructive surgery. He reckons robotics could account for 20 to 40 percent of knee operations. Much will depend, however, on how the rival systems stack up. Jefferies analysts said the semi-automated bone resection offered by MAKO might well win out in the long term, but Navio offers a far cheaper option and is still well ahead of anything the other two major manufacturers have today. Orthopaedic surgeon Haddad, who has experimented with both, said the machines were very different and healthcare systems would need to assess their cost-effectiveness in the light of clinical trial results. “I think the clinical benefit will be pretty obvious but whether that justifies the upfront outlay is a big question.” ","

Axis Chief Executive Albert Benchimol said the acquisition of Novae, which covers property, casualty, marine, aviation and political risk, would create a roughly $2 billion player in the London specialty market. The deal, expected to close in the final quarter of the year, will add to Axis’ earnings in the first year and allow it to bulk up in the Lloyd’s insurance market. “It (Novae) remains a relatively small player in a global industry. Axis is a substantial and successful business which represents an excellent partner for the Novae business, its customers and employees,” John Hastings-Bass, chairman of Novae, said. Axis operates in the United States, Europe, Singapore, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America. The deal has no termination fee, implying confidence from both parties that a counterbid was unlikely, Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said. But top Novae shareholder Neptune said the offer undervalued the company, and a fair offer would be at least 5 or 6 percent higher than the Axis bid. Neptune, which held 16 percent of Novae at the close of business on Wednesday, said Axis had bid after a “torrid” nine months for the company. “The buyer has approached at a time of short-term weakness in the share price,” Neptune’s Mark Martin, head of UK equities, said, suggesting there could be other potential suitors in private equity or corporate entities. Novae’s shares have fallen 26 percent over the past nine months, hurt by lower than expected underwriting contributions and changes to Britain’s Ogden rule, a tool for calculating personal injury and accident claims, which hit its full-year profit. Novae did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Neptune’s view. Insurers have been preparing for a wave of mergers and acquisitions, as valuations in the Lloyd’s insurance market became more attractive to overseas buyers due to a fall in the value of the pound after Britain voted to leave the European Union.

330, ,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A decade after the Islamist group Hamas seized Gaza, the Palestinian enclave is effectively unliveable for its 2 million people, with declining incomes, healthcare, education, electricity and fresh water, the United Nations said. In a report examining humanitarian conditions in the territory, which Hamas took over in June 2007 after a brief conflict with forces loyal to the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations concludes the situation in Gaza is deteriorating “further and faster” than was forecast only a few years ago. “Across the board we’re watching de-development in slow motion,” Robert Piper, the UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Aid and Development Activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. “Every indicator, from energy to water to healthcare to employment to poverty to food insecurity, every indicator is declining. Gazans have been going through this slow motion de-development now for a decade.” Immediately after Hamas took power, Israel moved to isolate the militant group by restricting the flow of goods and people in and out of Gaza, limiting access to the sea and working with Egypt to enforce a blockade. At the same time, Hamas has been in near-constant dispute with the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, prompting the PA to limit financial transfers to Gaza and, in recent weeks, asking Israel to cut back electricity supplies. The upshot is that Gaza’s population, which is projected to grow by another 10 percent in the next three years, is being squeezed on all sides, even as resources become more scarce. “I see this extraordinarily inhuman and unjust process of strangling gradually two million civilians in Gaza that really pose a threat to nobody,” said Piper. Asked who was doing the strangling, he replied: “Everyone’s having a go,” mentioning internal Palestinian political strife, Israeli security policies that leave Gazans caught in the middle, and regional dynamics including pressure on Qatar, a major donor to Hamas, from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. “That’s the message in this report, the fundamental message: Someone has got to step back and put the interests of civilians at the top of the queue for a change,” Piper said. “We talk about the unlivability of Gaza. When you’re down to two hours of power a day and you have 60 percent youth unemployment rates... that unlivability threshold has been passed quite a long time ago.” Gaza is a narrow wedge of land on the eastern Mediterranean, barely 40 km long and around 10 km wide, with most people living in densely packed, low concrete tower blocks, and many areas damaged in past bouts of fighting between Hamas and Israel. One of the most pressing challenges is power. Gaza needs at least 450 megawatts of electricity a day, but is now receiving 120 MW, partly because of the dispute between Hamas and the PA and a lack of internal power-generating capacity. By 2020, if growth picks up, Gaza will require up to 850 MW a day, but supplies are unlikely to top 360 MW. Piper sees ways in which conditions could quickly be improved without significant risk to Israel’s security, including expanding the fishing zone off Gaza to 20 nautical miles from six currently. A freer flow of goods, including water pumps, elevators, wood, steel, cables and other electrical equipment, would also help. Resolving the struggle between Hamas and the PA is essential in the long-run, but Piper says improving Gaza’s health, education, sanitation and growth is critical for Israel as well. “In the media, in the NGO community, and even in the Defence Ministry, you’ll find plenty of thoughtful Israelis that will recognise that, firstly, the current trajectory is threatening for Israel’s security and that a stable and prosperous Gaza... is also good for Israeli security,” he said.

331, ,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"(Reuters) - Kind LLC has hired investment banks to advise on a minority stake sale it hopes will value the maker of the eponymous snack bars at more than $3 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The stake sale will test the interest of some of the largest consumer food companies, which are looking to revitalize their sales as consumers turn to novelty and healthier alternatives. A deal could also give thirteen-year old Kind, which has developed a brand known for its use of ingredients “people can see and pronounce,” its first corporate partner to expand both in the United States and abroad. New York-based Kind, which has $727 million in annual sales according to Euromonitor, is working with investment banks BDT Capital Partners and Centerview Partners Holdings LLC on the stake sale, the sources said. BDT is also a minority investor in Kind. Kind is not offering the right to buy out the entire company down the line as part of the deal, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the process is confidential. “Kind is solely focused on becoming the foremost health and wellness leader to provide our consumers with delicious and healthy products so they can do the kind thing every day,” a Kind spokesman said, declining to comment specifically on the stake sale process. BDT declined to comment and Centerview could not be immediately reached for comment. Kind, founded in 2004 by Daniel Lubetzky, the Mexican-American son of a Holocaust survivor, sells nut bars, breakfast bars, clusters and fruit bites. It was one of the first popular food snacks to eschew artificial flavors and  preservatives, a trend that larger food companies are now embracing as they seek to woo back customers. In the United States, the world’s biggest packaged food market, upstart brands such as Kind could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade’s time compared with 5.0 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. In search of growth, food companies have turned to acquisitions, such as General Mills’ $820 million deal for organic food maker Annie’s Inc in 2014. Still, minority investments in established brands such as Kind have been less frequent. Private equity firm VMG group bought a stake in Kind in 2008. It later sold back its share to Lubetzky in 2014 in a stake sale that valued the company at $728.5 million. ","

332, ,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"SUPERIOR, Arizona (Reuters) - Rio Tinto’s proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona would tunnel 7,000 feet underground, where rocks radiate heat from the earth’s molten core. It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1,000 feet deep. Planned for more than a decade, the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U.S. mines as companies run out of easy-to-reach deposits, geologists say. It is also the project President Donald Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, had in mind as he began crafting a “hit list” of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting. “A company shouldn’t have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved,” Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview, referring to the mine. The massive project - which would be among the world’s largest copper mines - underscores the dangers of weakening America’s rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky. And Ross’s citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth. Sorting out the mine’s potentially negative impacts is anything but simple, and many local residents, along with Native American and environmental groups, say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny - no matter how long it takes. “The companies have to mitigate their risks - mitigate what people are losing,” said Mila Besich-Lira, the mayor of Superior, the town closest to the project. A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130,000 comments from concerned constituents - more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby. Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit. The regulatory review by Ross, due for release as soon as this month, is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape. Trump has also started dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations through executive orders, for example, and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create. In the meantime, Congress could set the tone. A Republican bill introduced early this year - and supported by Rio Tinto - would set a two-and-a-half-year deadline on mine permitting, a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada. It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines, a process that can take seven to 10 years. Victoria Peacey, a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto, said the mine up probably won’t begin operating for another decade. Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans. “There are mines this deep; there are mines this hot; and there are mines this big; but there are no other mines this deep, this hot and this big all together,” said Carl Hehnke, a geologist for Resolution. Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit. With help from remotely controlled machines, miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit. The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6.5 billion gallons of water a year - enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. It would eventually render more than 2,400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors. Under the forest, in a process called “block cave mining,” Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground, making the material above sink and creating the expected one-and-a-half-mile-wide crater. That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which has been holding annual protests against the project. If Resolution’s copper deposit had been discovered under private land – and not a national forest – Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators. Instead, the U.S. Forest Service is leading the study, which will consider jobs, recreation, public health and wildlife. Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior, where many homes and businesses are boarded up, residents still have their concerns. “What am I going to tell my great-grandkids - how this place was totally destroyed?” said Anna Jeffries, a Superior resident, during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School. Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process. “We are not talking in any way, shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here,” said Katie Sweeney, general counsel for the National Mining Association, a trade group. “We’re talking about bureaucracy.” The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting, along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively. The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill - introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada - that would give regulators the two-and-a-half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects. Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries, but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canada’s mine regulation had “major gaps in resources, planning and tools” that led to “inadequate” inspections and “increasing environmental risks.” Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U.S. Forest Service was doing “a good job in terms of Rio Tinto.” But he added, “The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U.S. Congress [about] how bad the process was.” Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit-issuing agencies. But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tinto’s Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds, Nigel Steward, in March. Steward called the U.S. permitting process “inefficient” and said it “presents a major barrier to the domestic sector’s ability to perform to its full potential.” Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved - along with more money for agencies “to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting,” said Todd Malan, Rio Tinto’s vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas. While the company supports permitting deadlines, at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years. “I’m not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful, but three years? ... That’s a tight time frame,” said Peacey. While uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for Rio Tinto, she said, the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public. “Those are people’s rights,” she said.

333, ,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Congress in the Dominican Republic rejected upholding the nation’s total ban on abortion this week, approving a step that would allow the procedure for ending life-threatening pregnancies and those resulting from rape or incest. The lawmakers in the lower house voted against a decision in May by the Dominican Senate, which turned down recommendations made by President Danilo Medina to amend the criminal code and ease the nation’s abortion ban. The Dominican Republic is one of seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have absolute bans on abortion. The decision by the Dominican Congress on Tuesday would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, when a mother’s life is in danger or when a foetus would not survive the pregnancy. The contrasting decisions in each house pave the way for another vote to be introduced. Hopes have been raised among abortion rights activists that the country’s ban on abortion - dating back to 1884 - can be finally repealed. “The vote has shown a clear majority of house representatives standing with Dominican women’s fundamental rights to decide over their bodies and to be treated with dignity. This must be celebrated,” Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at rights group Amnesty International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The earlier vote by the Senate “would have virtually maintained a full ban on accessing abortion services ... in a context of high rates of unsafe abortions, maternal mortality and adolescent pregnancies,” he said. It is not clear when a new vote on the ban will occur, and it could be months before lawmakers start debating the controversial issue again, campaigners say. As in the past, moves to repeal the ban will face staunch opposition from conservative groups and the influential Catholic Church. Janet Camilo, the country’s minister for women, has said the abortion ban is a health care issue for women and decisions not to repeal it were based on sexism. Blanket abortion bans put women’s lives at risk by forcing women to undergo dangerous backstreet abortions, which were the cause of at least one in 10 maternal deaths in Latin America in 2014, according to Amnesty International. In recent years, the United Nations has urged the Dominican Republic to lift its abortion ban. Activists say the country should seize the opportunity to allow women to access a safe abortion in a country where more than 90,000 unsafe abortions occur each year. “Now it’s imperative that Dominican lawmakers ensure that the new penal code proposed guarantees human rights and access to justice for all girls and women,” said Catalina Martinez, Latin America director at the U.S.-based Center of Reproductive Rights.

(BAC). Based on historical analysis by Merrill Lynch, there may be an opportunity to profit from taking short positions in these stocks through mid-July. Merrill defines over-owned stocks as those whose weight in the funds studied is more than 1.5 times their weight in the S&P 500 Index (SPX), and which are held by at least 35% of these funds. Topping the list as the most over-owned per Merrill's criteria is travel booking service The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN), whose relative weight (weight in the funds studied vs. weight in the S&P 500) is 2.63x, and which is held by 35.4% of those funds. The other eight are, in descending order of relative weight: payments processor Visa Inc. (V), online merchant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), managed health care company UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), Google parent Alphabet Inc. Class C (GOOG), drug maker Biogen Inc. (BIIB), payments processor MasterCard Inc. (MA), Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL) and mass media company Comcast Corp. (CMCSA). (For more, see also: Visa Inc. Announces Q4 and Fiscal Year 2016 Results.) At the opposite end of the spectrum, Merrill Lynch names six neglected stocks whose relative weights are 0.03x or less, and which are held by no more than 2.49% of the funds studied. These stocks are: electric and gas utility SCANA Corp. (SCG), furniture and engineered components manufacturer Leggett & Platt Inc. (LEG), insurer Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF), media conglomerate News Corp. (NWS), tax preparer H&R Block Inc. (HRB) and Connecticut-based bank holding company People's United Financial Corp. (PBCT). ""Positioning matters more than fundamentals in the short term, and this has been especially true around the quarter-end rebalancing,"" the Merrill Lynch report says. More specifically, based on data from the end of 2012 onwards, Merrill Lynch finds that crowded (overweight) stocks have underperformed neglected (underweight) stocks. Going a step further, Merrill Lynch has identified a trading strategy for the first 15 days after a quarter ends. Short selling the 10 most overweight stocks and buying the 10 most underweight stocks as of a quarter end has produced an average annualized gain of 119% over those 15 days. However, if you maintain those positions for 90 days after a quarter ends, the average annualized gain shrinks to 12%. Over the 18 quarters studied by Merrill Lynch, the annualized gains from the 15-day trading strategy have ranged from -31% to +875%. It produced losses in six of those 18 quarters, and the median annualized gain was 31.5%. For the 90-day holding period, the annualized gains ranged from -42% to +81%. Losses also were produced in six quarters, and the median annualized gain was 15%. In its report, Merrill Lynch does not present a theoretic rationale for its findings. However, as quoted above, Merrill does make a passing reference to quarter-end rebalancing. If portfolio managers consistently cut back on their most overweight positions shortly after a quarter-end, that would depress the prices of these securities, especially if the selling is widespread. Researchers have observed a similar dip in stock prices resulting from selling by mutual, pension and hedge funds around the end of each month, producing short-term buying opportunities, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. (For more, see also: What does the end of the quarter mean for portfolio management?)

""In order to provide more time to complete action on important legislative items and process nominees that have been stalled by a lack of cooperation from our friends across the aisle, the Senate will delay the start of the August recess until the third week of August,"" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Tuesday.

337, ,7132017,CNBC,7062017,"Dalian Wanda Group said it would sell Chinese tourism projects and hotels to Sunac China for $9.3 billion, marking a step back for the property giant from its theme park ambitions. The sale — the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data — is however expected to help Wanda cut its debt pile and strengthen its case for a listing on the mainland after it delisted from Hong Kong last year. Wanda said it would sell 91 percent of 13 cultural tourism projects, that typically include theme parks and leisure complexes, as well as 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for a total of 63.18 billion yuan. The Chinese group, with businesses spanning real estate, films, sports and entertainment, had plans to build at least 20 such cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his ""wolf pack"" of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co. ""This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy,"" said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think-tank. While Wanda did not give a reason for the sale, local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang saying the deal would greatly reduce Wanda Commercial's debt level and help the property unit to achieve an ""asset-light"" operation. ""Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year,"" Wang told Caixin. S&P downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into ""junk"" category. Wanda has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance and Fosun. Wanda had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan investment for its cultural and tourism projects. It has also been very active globally, buying U.S. cinema chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and taking a controlling stake in U.S. film studio Legendary Entertainment last year. The 91 percent stake in Wanda cultural and tourism projects, located across the country from the northern city of Harbin to Kunming in the south, will fetch 29.58 billion yuan.

Shares in Wanda Hotel Development  surged more than 150 percent after the news.

339,Rachel Cao,7132017,CNBC,7062017,"If you're looking for affordable health care, consider seeking medical attention outside the U.S. As costs continue to climb, retirees increasingly are looking abroad for less costly coverage. Below are the five best countries in which to find affordable health care, according to InternationalLiving.com. Just as in the U.S., metropolitan areas in these countries will typically provide better quality of care than rural ones, says International Living senior editor and author Dan Prescher, and often matches or beats care in the U.S. Large clinics and hospitals in Panama are often affiliated with U.S. counterparts such as the Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins Medicine International. While most expats tend to pay out-of-pocket, International Living says it's best to still have private insurance. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Panama offers coverage for as little as $80 per month for those under age 65. Older expats or those with pre-existing conditions may opt for a hospital membership that costs anywhere between $90 and $175 per month, according to International Living. Unlike many insurance plans, some hospitals may offer limited coverage for pre-existing conditions after a waiting period of one or two years. Mexico is known for providing health care at a fraction of U.S. costs. Expats can expect to pay half or less for medical expenses and prescription drugs. Legal Mexican residents have access to two health care systems: government-run public health or private. The government-run systems offers basic care with costs running as low as a few hundred dollars per year. Many expats also use private health care where you can pay with cash or use insurance. A standard visit to the doctor can run $30 to $40. The World Health Organization ranks Colombia's health-care system 22nd worldwide, which is higher than both Canada (ranked 30th) and the U.S. (ranked 37th). Anyone under age 60 with a national ID card, even those with pre-existing conditions, can apply for government health insurance. Co-pays average $3. Many ex-pat retirees pay a premium of $70 to $85 for a couple, according to International Living. Private health insurance can also be added. Premiums vary yet are still are significantly lower than what a couple would pay in the U.S. There are two medical systems in Costa Rica: a government-run one and the private medical system, with most people choosing to combine both. Caja is Costa Rica's universal health care system, which is available for both citizens and legal residents. As a Caja user, you pay an income-based monthly fee that covers the applicant and a dependent spouse. The fee is about $75 to $150, according to International Living, and provides complete coverage, including doctor and specialist visits, diagnostic testing and prescriptions. However, a major drawback is long waiting times for specialized surgeries, since Caja covers a majority of the population. The private medical system is another option. A doctor's visit there is $50, ultrasounds run $75 and major surgeries are usually half to a quarter of costs in the U.S., according to International Living. Malaysia's most popular areas of treatment are cosmetic surgery, dental work and dermatology, attracting 1 million medical tourists worldwide in 2016, according to International Living. George Town and Kuala Lumpur are the main medical centers. Most Malaysian doctors were trained in the U.S., Australia or the U.K., and all are English-speaking, a major perk for ex-pats.

Brownstein didn't get a response from any of the Uber executives he contacted, so he tried a different tactic. After his next ride, he wrote a response to a support ticket: ""The ride was fine, but you guys should really consider health care as your next application."" That idea later became UberHEALTH. Over the years, Brownstein, who is also a computational epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, has quietly become a go-to for tech executives as they plot their initial steps into the health sector. ""I work with tech companies because I think a lot about how we can use these data-sets to understand population health,"" he said in a recent interview with CNBC. Brownstein is fascinated by how the growing volume of digital data aggregated by tech companies can be meaningful. He studies how things like Google searches, data from wearable trackers, or social media posts can provide insight on predicting disease and improving health outcomes. He was among the first to develop an Apple CareKit application to make it easier to collect medical data for parents of children with special needs. He was also a pioneer in leveraging Twitter's health-related conversations to study public health issues like chronic disease and gun violence. He worked with a small group of researchers to find out whether Yelp reviews could be an indicator of food poisoning outbreaks. These days, he's intrigued by the health potential of Amazon's Alexa application. He's one of the judges for a Merck-sponsored competition to build diabetes-management apps for the voice application. And his team at Boston Children's Hospital developed its own app called KidsMD to provide simple health advice to parents. Not every idea has turned into a big success. For instance, he worked closely with Google on its ill-fated flu trends project, which was shut down three years ago because the data collected wasn't accurate enough. But Brownstein says that many of the first technology efforts in health care were ahead of their time. Efforts that get off the ground today might have a better shot, he said. ""There will be some successes, because the electronic medical record companies are more open than they used to be,"" he said. The newly available data from medical records includes labs, allergy lists and so on. This may be why some companies have held off on entering $3 trillion health sector.

The category is worth a possible 50 out of our 2,500 total. Looking to save some money? Check out these 10 cheapest states, along with average prices for some basic items in their most expensive metro areas. Price data based on the 2016 Annual Average Cost of Living Index by the Council for Community and Economic Research, C2ER. Time to live it up! Add a beer chaser to your Kentucky bourbon and you've got a classic boilermaker. A six-pack of imported beer will run you around $9 in Bowling Green. But the real bargain in Kentucky comes in the morning. The ibuprofen you'll need to nurse your hangover will cost just $6.56 for a bottle of 100 200-mg tablets. That's roughly half the cost of the same bottle in Minneapolis. 2017 Cost of Living score: 41 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Bowling Green Average home price: $271,778 Half gallon of milk: $1.81 T-bone steak: $12.38 Monthly energy bill: $168.98 Doctor visit: $77.67 The rapid change in the Texas economy following the recent collapse of oil prices has been difficult for the Lone Star State, but the silver lining appears to be a substantial drop in the cost of living — merchants simply can't charge as much these days. In last year's study, Texas was only the 21st cheapest state to live in. This year it joins the top 10. Speaking of silver linings, if you have a men's suit with one — or any color, really — it will cost you only about 8 bucks to get it dry-cleaned, even in the affluent northern suburbs of Dallas. That's just over half of what it would cost in New York City. 2017 Cost of Living score: 42 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Plano-Allen Average home price: $337,651 Half gallon of milk: $1.63 T-bone steak: $10.26 Monthly energy bill: $160.65 Doctor visit: $120.28 This is another state where a changing economy appears to have had a profound impact on consumer prices. The Sunflower State was only the 16th cheapest state a year ago. What happened? A bold — and many would say failed — experiment in tax reform has led to a host of state budget problems without the economic growth that Republican Gov. Sam Brownback predicted. A key feature of his plan was to pay for business tax cuts by sharply raising sales taxes. Because our data source excludes sales taxes in computing prices for many goods and services, it is possible that merchants have been forced to hold the line on prices somewhat in order to keep items affordable. But we don't know that for sure yet. So for now, Kansas is a bit of a moving target. 2017 Cost of Living score: 43 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Dodge City Average home price: $303,778 Half gallon of milk: $1.01 T-bone steak: $10.86 Monthly energy bill: $143.29 Doctor visit: $97.89 Tennessee gets its nickname, the Volunteer State, from its long tradition of military service. But historians disagree on which war made the nickname stick — the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War 34 years later or something else. They do agree the nickname does not come from the health-care professionals, even though some providers work really cheap. But they are not volunteers. It will cost just under $100 to get your eyes examined in Chattanooga. That is less than half of what the same service would cost in Fairbanks, Alaska. A strong economy has pushed prices up a bit in the past year, but you can still volunteer to pick up the check at dinner.

And you are wrong. Juice prices in Idaho are roughly the same as in Florida, maybe a little lower. Want a steak with your potatoes? You can pick up a nice T-bone for under $10. It would cost you one and a half times that in New York City. And a nice bottle of wine can be had in Idaho for around $5.

Last year, when gasoline prices were hitting $3 a gallon in some parts of the country, the average in and around Detroit was around $2.04. Michigan's economy has been going through a complex transformation. The auto industry rebounded and is now leveling off, Detroit is on the comeback trail after its historic bankruptcy, high-tech jobs are supplanting manufacturing, and health care is booming. While it all shakes out, the state, on average, is enjoying some of the most affordable real estate prices in the country. 2017 Cost of Living score: 48 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Detroit-Dearborn-Livonia-Troy Average home price: $274,355 Half gallon of milk: $1.76 T-bone steak: $13.37 Monthly energy bill: $175.87 Doctor visit: $97.06 Hit the McDonald's drive-through here at the Crossroads of America, in the state that's famous for the Indianapolis 500, and your Quarter Pounder with Cheese will cost you just $3.93 plus tax.

While you are out and about, maybe you want to run a few errands: A haircut will run you around $12 if you are a man; a trip to the salon for a woman is also a bargain, at around $32. At the grocery store a head of lettuce costs just $1.04, while a pound of coffee will set you back just $4.43. And ground beef? At $3.74 a pound, you could make four of your own burgers for nearly the same price as one McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese. 2017 Cost of Living score: 49 out of 50 points Most expensive area: Elkhart-Goshen Average home price: $270,204 Half gallon of milk: $1.74 T-bone steak: $13.28 Monthly energy bill: $144.39 Doctor visit: $105.83 Coca-Cola may have been invented a couple of states over in Georgia, but they first bottled it where?

342, ,7132017,CNBC,7062017," Since May, hackers have been penetrating the computer networks of companies that operate nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, as well as manufacturing plants in the United States and other countries. Among the companies targeted was the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., according to security consultants and an urgent joint report issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week. The joint report was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by security specialists who have been responding to the attacks. It carried an urgent amber warning, the second-highest rating for the sensitivity of the threat. The report did not indicate whether the cyberattacks were an attempt at espionage — such as stealing industrial secrets — or part of a plan to cause destruction. There is no indication that hackers were able to jump from their victims' computers into the control systems of the facilities, nor is it clear how many facilities were breached. Wolf Creek officials said that while they could not comment on cyberattacks or security issues, no ""operations systems"" had been affected and that their corporate network and the internet were separate from the network that runs the plant. In a joint statement with the F.B.I., a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said, ""There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks."" The hackers appeared determined to map out computer networks for future attacks, the report concluded. But investigators have not been able to analyze the malicious ""payload"" of the hackers' code, which would offer more detail into what they were after. John Keeley, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, which works with all 99 electric utilities that operate nuclear plants in the United States, said nuclear facilities are required to report cyberattacks that relate to their ""safety, security and operations."" None have reported that the security of their operations was affected by the latest attacks, Mr. Keeley said. More from the New York Times:Hacker who aided Russian intelligence is sentenced to 2 yearsPrivate not state hackers likely to have targeted UK parliament: SourcesHacks raise fear over NSA's hold on cyberweapons In most cases, the attacks targeted people — industrial control engineers who have direct access to systems that, if damaged, could lead to an explosion, fire or a spill of dangerous material, according to two people familiar with the attacks who could not be named because of confidentiality agreements. The origins of the hackers are not known. But the report indicated that an ""advanced persistent threat"" actor was responsible, which is the language security specialists often use to describe hackers backed by governments. The two people familiar with the investigation say that, while it is still in its early stages, the hackers' techniques mimicked those of the organization known to cybersecurity specialists as ""Energetic Bear,"" the Russian hacking group that researchers have tied to attacks on the energy sector since at least 2012. Hackers wrote highly targeted email messages containing fake résumés for control engineering jobs and sent them to the senior industrial control engineers who maintain broad access to critical industrial control systems, the government report said. The fake résumés were Microsoft Word documents that were laced with malicious code. Once the recipients clicked on those documents, attackers could steal their credentials and proceed to other machines on a network. In some cases, the hackers also compromised legitimate websites that they knew their victims frequented — something security specialists call a watering hole attack. And in others, they deployed what are known as man-in-the-middle attacks in which they redirected their victims' internet traffic through their own machines. Energy, nuclear and critical manufacturing organizations have frequently been targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The Department of Homeland Security has called cyberattacks on critical infrastructure ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront."" On May 11, during the attacks, President Trump signed an executive order to strengthen the cybersecurity defenses of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order required government agencies to work with public companies to mitigate risks and help defend critical infrastructure organizations ""at greatest risk of attacks that could reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or safety, economic security, or national security."" The order specifically addressed the threats from ""electricity disruptions and prolonged power outages resulting from cybersecurity incidents."" Jon Wellinghoff, the former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in an interview last week that while the security of United States' critical infrastructure systems had improved in recent years, they were still vulnerable to advanced hacking attacks, particularly those that use tools stolen from the National Security Agency. ""We never anticipated that our critical infrastructure control systems would be facing advanced levels of malware,"" Mr. Wellinghoff said. In 2008, an attack called Stuxnet that was designed by the United States and Israel to hit Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility, demonstrated how computer attacks could disrupt and destroy physical infrastructure. The government hackers infiltrated the systems that controlled Iran's nuclear centrifuges and spun them wildly out of control, or stopped them from spinning entirely, destroying a fifth of Iran's centrifuges. In retrospect, Mr. Wellinghoff said that attack should have foreshadowed the threats the United States would face on its own infrastructure. Critical infrastructure is increasingly controlled by Scada, or supervisory control and data acquisition systems. They are used by manufacturers, nuclear plant operators and pipeline operators to monitor variables like pressure and flow rates through pipelines. The software also allows operators to monitor and diagnose unexpected problems. But like any software, Scada systems are susceptible to hacking and computer viruses. And for years, security specialists have warned that hackers could use remote access to these systems to cause physical destruction.

344,"Bob Rall, principal at Rall Capital Management",7132017,CNBC,7062017,"Meeting with our clients is one of the best parts of my job. Many of our clients have been with us for several years, and our meetings are like conversations with old friends. While we spend a good amount of time in our meetings reviewing portfolios and discussing financial issues that are affecting them, most of our time is spent catching up on what has occurred in their lives since our last meeting and making sure we are all prepared for whatever might happen in their future. Every client is different, and therefore every conversation is different, but there are also a number of similarities. A couple of meetings I had last week demonstrate how similar our conversations can be at times. In two separate meetings with two separate longtime clients, I had the same piece of advice: ""Go spend some money"" was my message to both. That advice might sound funny coming from someone who makes a living by trying to get clients to save and invest for their future. But in these two cases, the advice was certainly appropriate. And based upon the report ""Living Too Frugally? Economic Sentiment & Spending Among Older Americans,"" by Matt Fellowes, CEO of United Income, it's probably appropriate for a lot more people. Both meetings I am referring to involved at least one spouse who is more than 80 years old. They are both still healthy, although both admit to starting to slow down a bit. The other thing they have in common is, both couples were very good savers through their working years and are very comfortable financially. Not rich, but comfortable. Both couples have nice-sized individual retirement accounts. And both are taking just enough from each to barely satisfy their required minimum distributions. More from Advisor Insight: The bad things good people do with 401(k) balances Beyond health, home and auto, do you know what kind of insurance you need? Dog eats cash, man makes stink ... and Treasury pays up My advice to go spend some money is based on my philosophy that because we get to go around only once in this life, we should limit the ""I wish we would have …"" thoughts before it's too late. A financial life-planning approach should aim to limit the regrets they may have at the end of life. ""I wish we would have taken more family vacations,"" ""I wish we would have traveled more,"" and ""I wish we would have given more"" are all examples of regrets. I certainly understand the desire to keep a healthy level of funds available in the event of a long-term-care need. In fact, I support it. The time bomb ticking inside of anyone's financial plan is the potential for a long stay in a nursing home. So I'm not advocating they go on some wild spending spree. But I don't want them so concerned about a potential need that they miss out on what life has to offer. The research report I mentioned earlier confirms that my clients are not unique in this regard. It suggests retirees are not spending enough in retirement to live out their lifelong dreams. The report indicates that, for a lot of seniors, a lack of confidence in future economic growth and their own financial well-being keeps them sitting on large portfolios. A study done by the University of Michigan for the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Commerce Department found that adults become less optimistic about future economic growth and financial health as they age. So they are less likely to spend their nest egg. The study also found wealth and investments generally grow as people age — so they are leaving behind large amounts of wealth when they pass away. While leaving behind some wealth for your heirs is certainly not a bad thing, I would guess (or at least hope) most kids would prefer to see Mom and Dad live life in such a way as to have few regrets. So do some long-term-care planning and make sure you will be able to afford whatever care you may need as you grow older. Then go spend some money. While names of these funds abound, they all aim to beat the market, either with better performance or risk management. Being an entrepreneur has many payoffs, but small-business owners need a good financial plan in place to attain them. Here are five common roadblocks to saving, along with tips on how to get over the hump and just start saving now.

Obamacare is on the verge of collapse -- at least according to some in Washington. It's easy to see why they think that's the case. Major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), have pulled out of most Obamacare exchanges after losing billions of dollars. Aetna (NYSE:AET) is one large insurer that has totally withdrawn from Obamacare exchanges. On the other hand, Trumpcare could be on the verge of collapse, as well. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) stated over the weekend that the Senate GOP healthcare bill endorsed by President Trump is ""probably going to be dead."" So what's next for the U.S. healthcare system? Those on the left are pushing for one solution, while those on the right want another. Here are two potential paths for the nation's healthcare -- and the vastly different scenarios for investors if each becomes reality. Image source: Getty Images. Former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) believes that ""the only long-term solution to America's healthcare crisis is a single-payer national healthcare program."" Sanders, a socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the U.S. Senate, promotes what he calls ""Medicare for all,"" -- a universal healthcare system where all Americans would receive full health insurance through Medicare. While there are other alternatives for a single-payer system in the U.S., Sanders' plan includes most of the goals of the political left. Under this plan, Medicare would pay all of Americans' healthcare expenses. There would be no co-pays and no deductibles. The federal government would negotiate all pricing with healthcare providers and drugmakers. Proponents maintain that a single-payer system such as this would lower the overall cost of healthcare. They point to other countries with government-funded healthcare with significantly lower healthcare spending levels per capita. Sen. Sanders states that his proposed plan would cost $1.38 trillion annually. This would be funded through tax increases. Employers would pay an additional 6.2% tax. Most Americans, regardless of income level, would pay a 2.2% higher tax. Income taxes for the wealthy (annual income of $250,000 or more) would be raised significantly and tax deductions limited. Also, capital gains and dividends would be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Image source: Getty Images. Not everyone agrees that the U.S. should shift to a socialist type of healthcare system. Conservatives and Libertarians argue for an approach that relies more on free market competition and lower regulations. One such approach has been proposed by another former presidential candidate, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a conservative ophthalmologist who describes himself as ""libertarianish."" Sen. Paul's plan is to totally repeal Obamacare and replace it with several key changes that give individuals more flexibility in purchasing health insurance. All Americans would receive the same tax deduction for health insurance regardless of whether they obtain insurance through their employers or buy it themselves. Health savings accounts (HSAs) would be encouraged through tax credits and eliminating maximum contribution limits. HSAs could also be used to pay for health insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. Individuals would be allowed to pool together to purchase insurance like employers currently do. These pools could include non-profit organizations, such as churches, civic groups, and trade associations, as well as other entities formed solely for the purpose of buying insurance. Small businesses would be able to pool together across state lines to purchase health insurance as well. Insurers would also be allowed to sell policies licensed in one state to any other state. It's not known exactly how much Sen. Paul's healthcare plan would cost, although it would certainly be far less than the $1.38 trillion cost for Sen. Sander's plan. The advantages of the plan, according to Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), are that it moves the U.S. in ""the right direction toward patient-centered healthcare, lower costs, bigger pools to insure everyone and cover preexisting conditions."" Brat stated that so far Paul's plan is ""the most free market approach to healthcare that will truly bend down the cost curve."" Image source: Getty Images. These are obviously starkly different plans with arguments for and against each one. How would investors be impacted if something similar to Sen. Sander's single-payer system became law? Shareholders of health insurance stocks would likely feel the most pain. It's possible that private insurers could offer Medicare Advantage plans as they do now. However, membership in these plans made up only 7.5% of UnitedHealth's total enrollment in 2016 and only 5.9% of Aetna's total enrollment last year. Health insurer stocks would plunge if a single-payer system was implemented. Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks would also no doubt suffer. We've already seen negative effects on these stocks from President Trump's statements earlier this year that he wanted to allow Medicare and Medicaid to negotiate prices with drugmakers. There's also a good chance that many other stocks would take a beating under Sen. Sanders' plan. Raising U.S. corporate taxes (which already rank among the highest in the world) probably wouldn't be seen as a good thing. Furthermore, increasing taxes on capital gains and dividends could cause investors to sell off stocks to avoid paying higher taxes before the single-payer system took effect. How would investors be affected by Sen. Paul's plan? Health insurance stocks would likely soar. Companies like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, which have retreated from the individual markets under Obamacare, would probably jump back in. HealthEquity (NASDAQ:HQY), which provides a technology platform for consumers to manage HSAs, would no doubt surge even more than it has over the last year. Stocks of companies that rely heavily on the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, on the other hand, would likely drop. How the stocks of drugmakers and of other industries would be impacted is hard to predict. It depends on the details that a final plan would include. Image source: Getty Images. The odds of Sen. Rand Paul's plan being implemented also seem low. He first floated his proposal in January. It hasn't gained too much momentum since then. For now, the most likely scenarios are probably either a modified version of Trumpcare or making changes to sustain Obamacare. Americans, including investors, will have to keep waiting to find out how they'll be impacted by whatever comes next. ","

A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: It was great, I was actually up in northern Maine in the quaintest little village. They did a parade that was basically just people walking down the street led by a drum major to a brass band. Harjes: That sounds awesome. Campbell: It was, it was so down home. Harjes: Was there anybody around to watch the parade, or was the whole town in it? Campbell: There [were] at least 15 people on the sidelines. Harjes: Solid, good turnout. Campbell: [laughs] But, it was a very nice Fourth of July. Didn't get to see any fireworks, though, how about you? Harjes: I saw enough for the both of us. I live in D.C., so you kind of have to. Campbell: Oh. I could hear them from afar, but those dreaded pine trees were blocking my view. Harjes: Oh, man. Maybe next year, come visit HQ, we'll watch some fireworks. Campbell: There we go. Harjes: I don't know about you, but I'm actually very happy to be back after the long weekend. I'm kind of happy to just be back in the office and in the studio. For the show today, we're talking about retail pharmacies. Rite Aid and Walgreens' attempts to make a deal were all over the news last week, before we took a hiatus for the long weekend, so we're going to digest these headlines for you all, and then talk about the pharmacy space at large. Sound good, Todd? Campbell: Yeah, there were a lot of fireworks last week, related to this merger, right? Harjes: That's a good way of putting it. Campbell: It's unfortunate, I know a lot of listeners are probably looking at it and saying, ""Please tell me something good."" This was a deal that was supposed to go through, it's hopefully going to go through. Back in 2015, investors were thinking they were going to get $9 a share -- Harjes: For Rite Aid? Campbell: Yeah, for Rite Aid, Walgreens offering over $9 billion to acquire the company, lock, stock, and barrel. Now, Rite Aid shares sitting below $3, you need to triple before you get back to those levels, and it's all about the FTC. And to mix a bunch of metaphors together, no joy in Mudville last week, the FTC has struck out the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger. Harjes: Right. Digging through the timeline here a little bit, as you said, back in October 2015, that's when you had the original deal that was announced. That was since revised because the FTC was like, ""No, you guys can't just get together, there wouldn't be enough competition in this space,"" which is perhaps not surprising when you consider that, between CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens, they completely dominate the retail pharmacy space. Campbell: It's crazy, Kristine. You have this top tier, because of consolidation over the last decade, of players that includes those three that you just mentioned, plus, Wal-Mart is a big player in that, too. But if you conclude just that top tier, they control two-thirds of market share in prescription drug volume by revenue. And that's just an amazingly consolidated industry to be trafficking in. And that's why, obviously, the FTC was concerned that pairing these two companies up together might be a problem. Harjes: Right. So, the two to revise their agreement down to an acquisition price of between $6.50 to $7.00 per share of Rite Aid, depending on how many of the Rite Aid stores were divested. That was going to be between either 1,000 and 1,200 stores sold to a company called Fred's, so that $6.50 to $7.00 range was dependent on how many stores, between 1,000 and 1,200, were divested. Campbell: Yeah. I felt like this whole deal was all about, ""What if we try this? What about this?"" And they just kept throwing darts at the wall, hoping that the FTC would say, ""Oh, that works for us."" But no. Harjes: Yeah. That was plan B. Last Monday, Rite Aid shares soared 30% on news that the merger is more likely than not to be approved by the FTC coming up ahead of their deadline of July 7th. But, now we're on to plan C because the deal fell apart again. Campbell: Yeah. Rumors and innuendo, don't buy stocks because of them. This is a prime example of, you never know if a deal is going to close until the deal closes, especially when you're talking about a very competitive market like pharmacy and pharmacy retail. Walgreens is the second largest player in terms of retail pharmacy market share with about 13.8%, Rite Aid clocks in about 5%; combine the two together, and they come out to about 19% market share in retail pharmacy. Obviously, that was too concentrated for the FTC to go ahead and say, ""Yeah, we're OK with it."" So, back to the drawing board for yet another try at a very different deal. Harjes: Right. So, now the deal is that Walgreens will acquire around half of Rite Aid stores, 2,186 of them, and they'll get some other things like inventory as well. In return, they will give Rite Aid $5.175 billion in cash, and Rite Aid will also receive a $325 million merger termination fee. Campbell: Yeah. Thank goodness that they were able to at least get this deal -- well, it's not approved yet -- but, to announce this deal at the same time that they announced Walgreens was abandoning the prior bid, because who knows where the share price would have gone on Rite Aid. As a refresher, to go back in time for investors, Rite Aid took on a tremendous amount of debt back in the late 2000s to expand, because they recognized, ""If we want to keep up with CVS and Walgreens, we need to grow our footprint, build up our buy power."" So, they did a lot of acquisitions, but unfortunately they did those acquisitions with debt, that debt was costly, and it really hamstrung them. For Walgreens to step in and say, ""We'll buy you, including all the problems you may have profitability wise,"" was great. Now we're looking at a situation where those problems still exist, there's still a tremendous amount of debt on the balance sheet, you have some questions regarding how bloated corporate expenses are relative to some of their other retailing peers -- there's a lot of things that make people nervous about this company surviving or thriving against CVS and Walgreens on a stand-alone basis. Some may be unfounded, though. Harjes: Yeah. I actually kind of like where this leaves Rite Aid. As you mentioned, they're sitting on a ton of debt, it's over $7 billion last time I looked. Right now, when they get $5 billion-plus from Walgreens, a lot of that is going to be able to de-lever them and help bring down interest expense. They paid $432 million in interest expense just last year. So, I like this shift in strategy from them, where they're not going to be trying to take on a bunch more debt to expand their footprint. In fact, they're doing the opposite. They're selling these stores to Walgreens so that they can actually focus on their own profitability. And, this is an important thing to note, they also have a PBM business, EnvisionRx is their pharmacy benefits management business, and that's going to become a more important segment of Rite Aid now that they don't have as many stores to worry about. Campbell: Yeah, it's almost like, we gave you the bad news, now maybe here's the good news, the silver lining, what could go right in the playbook for Rite Aid as you go forward. Without a doubt, like you said, EnvisionRx is a big part of that, because the pharmacy benefit management business is a higher EBITDA generating as a percentage of sales, it's more profitable than the retail store business. So, you're going to get a shift in revenue mix that would theoretically provide a tailwind to the company's profitability once this deal closes -- assuming, obviously, the FTC doesn't block it. The FTC could still halt this deal in its tracks, so people should be aware that risk still exist. It doesn't yet have the blessing of the regulators. If EnvisionRx is able to continue to grow against some very large players, including Express Scripts and CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare has a PBM business as well, then theoretically, an argument, I think, could be made that investors are overreacting with how much they've driven down the share price. If I just look at price to sales for Express Scripts, it's about 0.40 right now. If I look at the fact that the EnvisionRx business is going to do $6 billion in sales, you could make an argument that that's worth $2.4 billion, and the market cap of Rite Aid right now is about $2.7 billion. So, would you pay $300 million for 2,000 stores? I would. Harjes: Yeah, absolutely. That's a really interesting point. Before we take a break, what about Walgreens in this situation? Where does this leave them? Campbell: Walgreens, I think, is a winner in this. Theoretically, they've got to go through, look at their entire footprint, figure out what stores they could get from Rite Aid that would dovetail perfectly within their own model. They say they're going to be able to make this deal accretive within one year. They think they can carve $400 million in synergies, i.e., cost savings, layoffs, whatever, out of this deal. So they're going to make money on this deal. So, from Walgreens' perspective, we don't get the problems, we don't have to buy the problems, we can just buy the stores we want, walk away, and theoretically this makes us bigger, stronger, and even more profitable. So, I think they are a winner. Rite Aid is more of a mixed bag, because you're looking at it and saying, how much of the debt will we pay off? Will we be lean and mean enough to be able to survive and thrive as we go forward? There is something else, though, Kristine, that we didn't mention, and we should probably touch on really quick, and that's the ability to piggyback on Walgreens' buying power. Harjes: Oh, yeah, this is an important detail, here. I'll let you go into the details, but essentially, Rite Aid can still buy drugs at cost from Walgreens affiliates for up to 10 years. Campbell: Right. One of the big reasons that Rite Aid stores have suffered profitability-wise has been a lot of payback and compression on margins in the back end of the store, the pharmacy business at the retail stores. And a lot of that has come from generic drugs, which are obviously lower-cost, lower-margin drugs, and they represent 90% of all prescriptions written. So, the ability to team up and piggyback on Walgreens' purchasing power -- because Walgreens is much larger and they get much better deals on these drugs -- theoretically, that should boost store profitability. There [are] also opportunities to boost store profitability by investing in RediClinics, which are in-store clinics that could drive additional volume there as well, and doing remodeling. They have about 60% of their footprint will be updated to the most recent model that they like, the format that they like, the wellness format, and I assume they'll double down and get the rest of that 40% upgraded to those stores, too. Harjes: We talked a little bit about what is next for these major retail pharmacies, but we left out the risk that they will be disrupted entirely. It may come as little surprise that Amazon is a threat to the front-of-store sales in the brick-and-mortar stores, but the threat doesn't stop there. Amazon could effectively compete with these companies' entire operations, and it's not as far-fetched as it seems. Campbell: Amazon is, without a doubt, one of the most innovative and aggressive retailers out there, and they have successfully disrupted business after business after business. In May, some people and some chatter started about it potentially getting into the pharmacy retailing business. Again, this is rumor, and we don't want to buy stocks based on rumor. However, there is some smoke that could indicate there's fire here to the idea that Amazon might try and figure out a way to either use its newly acquired Whole Foods stores to help with prescription fulfillment somehow, as delivery centers or pickup centers, and there is some other evidence that they're making a push into the pharmacy benefit management business, which we talked about a little bit earlier in the show, for their own use, and that they could theoretically open that pharmacy benefit manager up to anyone, to all sorts of employers across the nation. Harjes: And that's so Amazon of Amazon, to do it like that, where they create something for their own internal usage and then flip it to be external-facing, where anybody can come in and use it then. And they're so good at doing this. In fact, actually, this reminds me of an article I read recently in TechCrunch called ""Why Amazon Is Eating The World."" If anyone listening is interested in this article, it was a really amazing deep dive into how Amazon is poised to win everything because of this model of developing things internally and then exposing them externally. Anyway. Specifically about the PBM, Amazon has 128,000 employees. CNBC reports that they're creating an internal pharmacy benefits manager for those employees. This is a business where scale is everything. Margins are slim, efficiency is huge. So, when you look at Amazon, that sounds exactly like something Amazon could win. They're amazing at supply chain efficiencies, all their sourcing, and their distribution. If they're able to harness that kind of scale and those efficiencies, I can really see them competing in this space. Campbell: With that many employees, you know you're spending a heck of a lot of money on healthcare. So, from an internal perspective, developing your own pharmacy benefits manager -- as a refresher, what those pharmacy benefit managers do is negotiate for lower drug prices with the drug manufacturers and the distributors. So, the bigger scale you have, the better price you can get. Amazon is a huge employer, and it's probably not lost on them that if they took their size and paired it up with some of the other large employers in the country, maybe we can really get their expenses to drop when it comes to healthcare cost. So, there is reason to think that without a doubt, they're doing the PBM. They already hired somebody earlier this year, that's a fact. Based on just looking at LinkedIn profiles, I found a gentleman named Mark Lyons, who used to work for Premera Blue Cross, which handles or ministers the health insurance program for Amazon employees, they hired him to theoretically develop this pharmacy benefit manager. There's also been some talk of job postings out there for other positions that would also be tied into developing this pharmacy business of some sort. So, I think that's a very intriguing angle for them. I don't think it would be out of the question for them to try and pursue it. They're going to have to overcome some regulatory hurdles anyway internally, so why not leverage all of those lessons learned to expand it more broadly? Also, Kristine, it shouldn't be ignored that over in Japan, where, of course, you have a different regulatory framework, they're experimenting by doing some partnerships with pharmacies in major population centers where you can order your prescription online, have it validated by a pharmacist, and then you can go pick it up at the pharmacy. That way, that model, is kind of similar to a deal that Amazon had with drugstore.com way back in the day. Kristine, do you remember drugstore.com? Harjes: I do not. Campbell: This was the internet heyday, late 1990s, ""Wouldn't it be great if we could order things online like our prescription medicine?"" It came out at around the same time that mail order pharmacy was really starting to become a big thing. Amazon took a 40% stake in drugstore.com, and drugstore.com had a 10-year supply relationship with none other than Rite Aid. So, it's interesting to think that Bezos was on drugstore.com's board, that Amazon was a big investor in this early on play, and that there was already some familiarity with Rite Aid via that deal. Now, I don't want to start flaming the fire that maybe Amazon would come knocking on Rite Aid's door, but it did dawn on me that Rite Aid already has EnvisionRx, and Amazon has shown it has an interest in retail store footprints by buying Whole Foods. So, why couldn't you just buy the PBM business from Rite Aid, plus the stores, and voila, you're in the pharmacy business. Harjes: Yeah. I could see that. Obviously, you and I are just speculating, here, but I would be really interested to see a map of the store footprint overlay of Amazon distribution centers, plus the Whole Foods stores they just acquired, plus existing Rite Aid stores that are not going to end up being sold to Walgreens. I don't think you actually even know that last part yet, I don't think they've cherry-picked just yet which stores they would actually take. That's probably contingent on this deal actually being approved by the FTC. Campbell: It's going to actually be rolled out, Kristine, in phases. They're going to take some stores at a time. They do have a pro forma map out there that would show the concentrations afterwards. Rite Aid will be mostly West Coast and Northeast. So, something to keep in mind for anyone at home as they're drawing their own maps, sketching it out with their own paper and pencil, ""Would this really makes sense?"" Harjes: Yeah, I'm kind of doing this in my head right now, and from the overlay maps that I've seen of Whole Foods and Amazon, that's kind of already where they are, it's a lot of Amazon on the coast, and Whole Foods also on the coast, but filling in some of the gaps in the Midwest region. Campbell: Yeah, and the smaller footprint of Rite Aid stores, Kristine, I have a Rite Aid near me, but I don't have a Whole Foods anywhere near me. Harjes: Interesting. Campbell: So, I think there are opportunities for them to fill in the gaps. Again, this is pure speculation, people. We don't know what's going to end up happening, or how Amazon will pursue this, or even if they will pursue it. They definitely throw a lot of things at the wall to see what sticks. There just happens to be some interesting evidence that they've been interested in this industry in the past via drugstore.com, that there are some drum beats to the idea that they might be exploring doing the PBM, and then, of course, with the recent news of the deal falling apart with Walgreens, it just makes it interesting to speculate and say, ""Hmm, would Rite Aid be intriguing to Amazon?"" It's anyone's guess how this will all shake out, but it's definitely, definitely something that people are going to want to keep an eye on, because wow, the reverberations would be huge. Harjes: Oh, absolutely. This isn't just you and me speculating on this. There are clearly investors everywhere that are making the connections between these two different spaces. For example, on the day of the acquisition announcement of Whole Foods, I was looking at shares of some of these pharmacies, and I remember seeing both CVS and Walgreens down about 4.5% each, just on that day. For example, Walgreens gets 78% of its total gross profit from retail pharmacy. So, these industries are very much intertwined, and I suspect they will become even more so. Campbell: Yeah. You want to really start putting on your look-forward cap -- what would it look like in the future? If you were a Prime member, would you qualify for free delivery, if you were somehow able to be vetted so that you knew your medicine could show up to your door like mail-order, very simple [to] be able to use it and order it? I mean, who out there does not have an Amazon account at this point? They have, what, 80 million Prime members, or something ridiculous like that. Theoretically, you could create one heck of a rewards program around this whole thing. Harjes: Yeah, and they are a trusted name. In a Wells Fargo survey, they found that five in 10 adults would use or probably use an Amazon pharmacy. Campbell: I would. Harjes: I would, too. I absolutely would. So, yeah, you made a good point earlier about how you really do need to look far out into the future if you're going to be a long-term investor, like we preach here at The Motley Fool. Campbell: Absolutely. And with over $300 billion in prescription drug spending in the U.S. alone, this is a massive market that's ripe for disruption, and there's no one who's better at supply chain, as you indicated earlier, than Amazon. If somebody can figure out a way to shave an additional percentage off of cost, it's going to be Amazon. Harjes: Absolutely. Todd, thank you, as always, for calling into the show today.

    Could a Reckoning at Rite Aid Spark an Amazon.com Acquisition? -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9999
347,Buck Hartzell,7132017,Fool,7062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2010, President Obama selected Beth to be a member of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability, where she created MoneyAsYouGrow.org, which has since been adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Buck Hartzell recently sat down with Beth at Fool HQ to find out more about the importance of educating children about money, saving, and more. A full transcript follows the video. Buck Hartzell: Thank you, all, for coming! Welcome, Beth, to The Motley Fool! I'll give you a quick introduction, and then we'll get into some questions, and we'll help all of us that have kids in the audience make your kids money geniuses, I think that's a desire that we all share. Beth Kobliner: Even if you're not. Hartzell: Yeah. And that's great. When I look at some of the folks that come here to The Motley Fool for help with their finances, they have degrees, sometimes graduate degrees in certain topics, but they don't have a basic understanding of a lot of things that you mentioned in your book, whether it's a Roth IRA or a 401(k) or how much they should contribute. So, the question is, where did you learn about money? Was that something that you learned in school? Or did it come from somewhere else? Kobliner: I definitely didn't learn it in school. I grew up middle class in Queens. My dad was a teacher and then a principal, and my mom was a chemistry teacher, but by the time I was born, a stay-at-home mom. My parents scrimped and saved to have enough money to send us to college. In fact, I was saying this before, I found a spreadsheet that my dad made in 1981, and my parents said, ""You can either get into Brown,"" or a few other schools that I didn't get into, ""Or you can go to Queens College,"" which was our neighborhood school that was basically free, because they felt like it was worth the scrimping and saving. He made a whole spreadsheet on what I would have to contribute, $2,000 a year, which adjusted for inflation was about $10,000 today. So, I think that, observing my parents, they're both Depression generation babies, they were both born in 1929, and my mom would only shop on triple coupon day and she would buy in bulk, and we had 20 cans of tuna fish in our basement because she would always buy when it was a big sale, if you buy a lot you save more money. So, they were really careful about money, but I never felt a lack of much. When I think that, except for once where I wanted a Lacoste Izod alligator shirt -- I never got one, and now I don't want one -- but other than that, I think, kids learn by osmosis, and I don't think you need to be a money genius to teach a kid to be smart about money. But I think, if you love to spend, or that's what you value, those messages come across a little to kids. Hartzell: And you mentioned your parents. Harold is mentioned in there, Shirley is mentioned throughout the book. There were some great stories in there. One involved a candy shop. Do you mind sharing a little bit about that story? Kobliner: Thank you. My dad is Harold, my mom is Shirley. Didn't make up those names, that's their names. My dad was born in 1929, and his father was an alcoholic. I don't think you called it that back then, but he didn't work throughout the whole Depression, and his mom was a seamstress. They had four kids. His brother, when he was born, slept in a drawer because they couldn't afford a crib. They were very poor. And my dad decided when he was 10 that he needed a job. So what he did was he sat in a candy store, the local candy store. He lived in this tenement. And every time the phone would ring in the candy store, the public pay phone, my dad would pick up the phone and run out to the tenement, because nobody had phones in those days, he would say, ""Mrs. Jones, phone call!"" And Mrs. Jones would come downstairs, he tells the story like, she had curlers in her hair and she would come down, and he would get a tip. He would get a nickel or a dime for telling her that there was a phone call. And he was sitting in a candy store doing this, and he used to say to my kids when they were little, ""Do you think I bought candy?"" And they were like, ""Yeah!"" And he said, ""No. I saved that money, I never bought candy, and I gave it to my parents,"" because they were always fighting about money and he thought maybe if he could give them a little more money, give them a little bit, that it would make a difference. And that, to me, is the epitome of that delayed gratification, and that ability to be able to say, ""I'm not going to spend it now, I'm going to think toward the future."" And I do think that the Depression generation had that, and I would argue Millennials, who are always bashed, with avocado toast or whatever, I actually think the Millennials I've been talking to also have a bit more of trying to get a bargain and not getting into credit card debt, that similar kind of mentality. Hartzell: Boomers not so much. Kobliner: Boomers and Gen X-ers, forget it. [laughs] Hartzell: [laughs] You mentioned delayed gratification, which appears throughout the book. An important topic. Carol Dweck talked about the effort effect, which I think aligns pretty well with that, and the marshmallow test, of course, which you talk about. Can you give us an example? How do you get kids, and I think, in a world where there's cellphones in almost everyone's hands, you have social media, you have video games, you have fidget spinners, I saw Tom over there with his fidget spinner, how do you get somebody to delay gratification? Kobliner: Tom, are you going to take that question? [laughs] I think that there are different ways. You could talk to your kids about, ""One day, we as a family are going to go to Disneyworld or Europe and we're going to have to save for that. And we have three or four years before we can go, and if we save this amount, we're not going to eat out as much,"" having concrete goals and examples, I think, is a wonderful way to make it clear, to start putting that message in kids' minds. Also, some kids who really like math, you can go to investor.gov, and if you plug in different interest rates and you save 20 years or 40 years, it's so fun to look at that number. ""If I start at 16 and I save every year for four years with my summer earnings of $1,000, I'll have $100,000 by the time I'm 65."" Or, if you save $1 a day starting at age 10, and you do that to age 65 and earn 7%, you'll have $200,000. Just, numbers like that can motivate, and anecdotes. I learned from my parents, my mom would say, ""If you want to teach your kids a message, tell them a story."" I was like, ""What if I don't have a story?"" She said, ""Make it up."" But, telling kids, ""Our old neighbor, he didn't have a lot of money, but he saved $100 a month, because he always wanted a boat. And he was able to save up that money."" That kind of concrete goal I think is really critical, and gets the message across to kids. You have to say it a million times. Just like vegetables, they have to try it eight times before they like it. You could probably say it 800 times. Hartzell: I like the idea of having something fun, and a way to celebrate your savings, too. I think one of the things that some folks here, Robert Brokamp, some folks at The Fool talked about having different savings jars or buckets for different things. One of them could be college, and that's a longer-term goal, and there's another shorter-term goal, it could be, ""I want to buy a new football,"" or, ""I want to celebrate by buying something that I really like."" And that's the way, I think, maybe, to get people delaying buying something today with buying something even nicer a little bit down the line. So, work ethic is a topic that comes up a lot. Certainly with your parents, Depression-era, and being around there, is an important thing. I'll ask this question, and I'll share an anecdote with somebody here. One of the Hartzell kids' favorite thing to do is, when we get snow around here, which isn't very often, they've realized that's actually money laying around on the sidewalk -- Kobliner: I made so much money shoveling snow. Hartzell: Yeah! And there are a lot of people in our neighborhood that are old or don't want to shovel their own snow, so as soon as the snow hits they're out early, the crack of dawn, and shoveling snow in driveways. And one of their friends happened to be over and found out about this, and they were like -- Kobliner: Uh oh, competition. Hartzell: ""This is great, there's money out there waiting to be shoveled up."" Kobliner: Literally. Hartzell: So, they went out and knocked on door around their neighborhood, and one gentleman in the house came out and was so amazed, he said, ""I've been waiting,"" he happens to own a business, owns a company, and he said, ""I've been waiting for 10 years for some kid in our neighborhood to come around and ask me if he wants to shovel my snow. So, I'm going to pay you to shovel the driveway, and here's a $100 tip."" And they were like, oh my gosh! This was unbelievable for them. So, the question for you is about work ethic. Are we making kids lazy today? Are we enabling them to be lazy? Or is that just my impression, that kids are different today than they were maybe a long time ago? Kobliner: I love that story. That's a great story. I made a bundle. I remember so clearly. It was like, $5. They would ask how much do you charge, and we're like, ""Well, whatever you think,"" and that was a mistake because people would say, ""Oh, $2,"" and we were sweating. But, I think that today, take high school. If you look at the statistics, it's not that kids necessarily have that much more homework, at least according to the research I've looked at, although I think my kids have so much more homework than I did back in high school. But the pressures to do well, to take SAT prep courses, to take SAT II prep courses, all these things that didn't exist. When I was working, I had four jobs in high school, I worked at a diner, I worked at a grocery store, I worked at a pharmacy, and I think that there are more pressures and there are more demands on kids' time, the idea that you need to be on a team, all these resume-building items. And, also, we know, in some ways, it makes logical sense, because research shows that if a kid works over 10 to 15 hours a week in high school, kids who work more than that are likely to not graduate from high school, they're more likely to not graduate -- in other words, it's OK to work around 10 to 15 hours a week, but once you pass that mark, that's a dangerous sign, if your kid is working much more than that, because they're not spending enough time on their school work. But I do think working over the summer, the internship versus paying summer camp job that your kids are doing -- I think it's smart what you're doing because you're starting younger. And I think when kids are in middle school and high school, having those summer jobs, it is important. But the year or two before high school, I don't know what you would do, if your kid either had an internship working in a lab with a scientist or whatever, versus working bagging groceries. As a parent, it's a tricky equation to figure out. Hartzell: Yeah, it's definitely a balance, for sure. I know we're getting ready to go on a family vacation here in a couple of days to Europe, and our kid missed out on an internship that he got for going, because we're going to be away. Kobliner: Can I come? [laughs] Hartzell: But, you have to balance some of those things out. On investing, and you've talked about mutual funds and indexing and keeping your costs low, we totally agree with that and love that idea. You didn't seem as enamored with owning individual stocks for children, so I wanted to talk a little bit about that. My kids own stocks, they have their own portfolio, and I think it's fun to follow individual companies. You learn a lot of lessons around those. What are your thoughts on owning individual stocks versus an index fund or an ETF or something like that? Hartzell: Yeah. And low expense ratio, as you mentioned. You get exposure right away off the bat to all those 500 companies. Kobliner: Right, diversification, exactly. Hartzell: We also like the idea, and I think a fun thing to do, sometimes, for kids, when they own some stock, is go to an annual meeting and make that an event and have it fun. Kobliner: Isn't he a fun dad? [laughs] Hey, kids! Hartzell: Usually those annual meetings are on weekdays and you get out of school, so that's a bonus right there. And some of them actually serve chocolate covered strawberries and things afterwards, so there's some rewards in there. So, let's talk a little bit more here about, how can we make money just fun? I think that's one of the things, my oldest son is 16, he's taking a course online on personal finance, he doesn't exactly enjoy it. This is the same person who goes to an annual meeting. He'll tell you everything about Apple, he knows everything about them. But it's just not that fun. How do you put the fun back in finance, how can we do that? Hartzell: Thank you. Kobliner: He's 87. But, that idea of, this is something that's important. And there's no question your kids are going to grow up and say, ""This is something that's important. Lord knows he pretended to like all those annual meetings."" [laughs] To make dad happy. But that's setting the tone for what you think is important as a parent, and that does so much, it goes such a long way. Hartzell: Speaking of not real. College is one of the most expensive things most people will buy. To a lot of them, it doesn't seem like a real expense, a lot of them will borrow an immense amount of money to go there. You talk positively about college, too, about how important it is to get an education for your future earnings potential. So, the question for you is, how much is college worth? An Ivy League school nowadays is probably north of $300,000 if you want to do four years of school. As good consumers, as frugal coupon clippers and everything else, what's the amount that somebody should be willing to pay when they're looking around at schools? What's the right amount? Kobliner: I think this is a huge issue, and more and more, hopefully, I don't think it'll happen in the next 3.5 to 4 years, but I think paying attention to the cost of college. One rule of thumb that I heard of from this guy Mark Kantrowitz, who's this guru on student loans, is, don't have your kid borrow more than the first year's income. If the kid makes $40,000, try not to have him or her borrow more than $40,000. Which is still a big chunk of money. The average right now is $37,000. The median -- it's hard to get the numbers exactly, which in itself is a crime, that we don't have really good statistics -- is $20,000 for kids graduating from college. And the reliance of private student loans, which is only going to get worse because the rules have already been loosened up, that private student loans are usually much higher interest rates than federal student loans, which are still about 4-4.25% right now. Private student loans can be double digits, 15-16%, and they're harder to pay back as well. And I think, we're getting to, I'll meet someone who says, ""I'm a philosophy major."" I mean was an English major at Brown, don't get me wrong. But I think there really was, back in the day, you could be a great writer and come out and get a job. Or start The Motley Fool. [laughs] What was your major? Tom Gardner: English. Kobliner: English! Woo! [laughs] Hartzell: I was sociology. Kobliner: Ah, there you go! But I think it's much more difficult now for kids, and grad school. So many young people are thinking, ""I'm going to grad school, they would be like $200,000 to get my PhD in philosophy."" And as much as that's brilliant, there are no jobs. Even if you come out of Harvard philosophy school, if there's such a thing, there's still one or two jobs in the whole country. So, you have to be much more pragmatic. It makes me so sad, I've met so many parents over the last year who say, ""We scrimped and saved because our kid got into this school, and we thought it was so great, but after the first year our kid was miserable, we forgot to include travel costs, and we're going to send them to the local public school and we realized we had three more kids down the line."" It's so expensive and so mystifying, the whole financial aid form. And I'm a little bit depressed by this because when I was on President Obama's Council, they really made an effort, and Arne Duncan, who's the education secretary, really tried to make the FAFSA form, the free financial aid form, a little simpler. And they really tried to take some steps. But, it's really hard for parents. Hartzell: And a lot of kids get in -- I paid a visit to my financial aid office where I went to undergraduate school and asked them a little bit about what they see coming through the office, what are the challenges and problems? And they were saying, it used to be that parents would come in and co-sign for these loans, but now they aren't, because although the parents earn in plenty to co-sign, they have a lot of debt, so they're not co-signing. And I think a lot of the students don't necessarily realize, these aren't loans you can walk away from. They're going to be with you a long time. Over $1 trillion in student debt now, I think being pragmatic probably makes sense. You have a great point that I love in the book. It's called your 10 investment rules. I'm not going to go through all 10 of those, but if you could just riff on a couple of those I'd be interested to hear them. One is, you don't need to be a perfect investor to be a good investor. What do you mean by that? Kobliner: I think it's something I've heard throughout my 30 years writing about personal finance. What? It's been 30 years doing this? I'd better be damn good at it. [laughs] But, I think it's that, if you have money in the market -- you need to have money in the stock market. And whether you feel like, ""I'm really good at this, picking stocks,"" just putting some money in the stock market, ideally it might be in an index fund, you will do better than not being in the market at all. And as the saying goes, perfection is the enemy of the good, people are like ""Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure, I'm not going to sign up for a 401(k) because I don't really know what investment to choose,"" that procrastination, life goes on and you miss out. So, I think just making sure you're in the stock market, and making a choice, and hopefully a low-cost one. We know, research shows, it's much better than staying out of it completely. Hartzell: We see that with a lot of new investors, that fear of failure. And I think of it like the person who has all straight A's never want to get a B, they never want to fail. And the reality is, in investing, if you're the best in the world, you're going to be wrong 40% of the time. It's OK. It's OK to buy a stock that goes down or doesn't work out, because of the successes you're going to have over the course of your lifetime are going to far outweigh some of those losses. So, that fear of failure is something we talk a lot about here at The Fool. Kobliner: At least, statistically speaking. We don't know, we can't promise for the future of stocks or the stock market. But we know, if we use past history, as a group of stocks, predictably, we think it will do better over the long time. I meet so many people who might get a financial, personal finance, in your 20s and 30s, and you meet people in their 40s and 50s, and now I met someone who was 60s, and they were like ""I read your book when I was younger."" I'm like, am I 112 years old? How does that math work? But people have said, they did put a little bit in. And I said, ""Put 10%, just put 10%, I know you can afford it, just do it."" And then they said, and I'm sure you get the same thing, ""I look back and I have hundreds of thousands of dollars that I wouldn't have otherwise."" And I think of it like, you drink three cups of coffee a day and you cut back to two, and the first week you have headaches and it's so hard, but after a while, it's OK. I think the same with money, you just force yourself, if you earn $20,000, $50,000, $200,000, you have to put 10% away. And your lifestyle, just live off the rest, the 90%, and your lifestyle adjusts, and you don't buy certain things, and it works out. And I think that mentality is just important. Hartzell: Another rule is, be lazy and trade less. Does it pay to be lazy? Hartzell: Yeah. And one of the dangers of the ETFs now, which proliferate all over the place is, you can buy and trade them like stocks, which is a double-edged sword for a lot of us, because we see people trading in and out of sectors and doing all those things that hurt them in stocks, but now they can do them in ETFs and they feel safer, but it's not necessarily safer because they're doing the same thing, you're churning them, you're paying commission. Kobliner: Not at all. You just buy the broad-based index, and you put maybe 20% of it internationally. I do think that money is one of those things that, you can be lazy. You can set it and forget it, putting whatever you can into your company 401(k) and making sure that over time that you put the maximum in, or putting money into an index fund. I think those are those set it and forget it things, and they're so beneficial for people. And it's counterintuitive. You think the smart people are actively trading. No, actually, they're doing worse. Hartzell: There's one point in this book that made me a little bit sad. I have a daughter, she's in the middle, 14 years old. You mentioned that parents or more open and more likely to talk to their boys about money and finance than they are to their daughters. And one of the things we see when I go out and talk to colleges, if you go to an investing club, it's probably 80-90% males. We see, not to that great of a degree, across our services. We certainly see more males that are interested in money. So, my question is, do we just not talk to the girls about money and finances? Or is it that we need to talk to them in a different way, maybe, than we talk to boys about money and finance? Hartzell: I have a couple more questions, and I want to do a short section on buy, sell, or hold, and then we'll take any questions from people in the audience. In your opinion, as an expert in this field, what's the most important thing that we can do as parents to teach our children? What's the most important thing? If you had to take one thing away, go home and do this with your kids, what would that be? Kobliner: I would say, no matter your child's age, teach them that credit card debt is a bad thing. I just heard that Warren Buffett says that, too. I wish he would stop copying me. It's, the notion that, if you have a credit card, and there's certainly less credit card debt, like I said, among young people, because they couldn't get credit cards in high school, the rules changed in 2009, you had to either have an income or be 21, or have a parent co-sign to get a credit card. Which is a mistake, never co-sign a credit card with your kid. But, I think, teaching a kid, do not spend more than you have in your savings, do not buy things you cannot afford, is a concept that people still don't get. And I think that's a lesson that I knew, by osmosis coming from parents who were Depression-generation, and my father said, he's 87 years, so, I don't know how long he's had a credit card, but he never paid a late payment, he always paid in full. I think, if you have a credit card that's charging 15%, paying it off is equivalent of earning 15% guaranteed on your money after taxes. And that's still basically the best. You can't get 15% guaranteed after taxes anywhere, except a 401(k) with matching, which is 100%. Hartzell: And stocks have only done about 9% over their history. Kobliner: Right. So, don't get into credit card debt. Teaching it to kids. Because, I think kids see it as magic. ""My parents swoosh this card and they get something."" And it's very confusing for kids, and that's debit cards, but I think credit is really such an insidious thing, credit cards can be so problematic for people down the line, that I would say, that would be it, if I had to take just one financial lesson. Hartzell: On the flip side, the mistakes. We all make mistakes as parents in different things. What's the biggest mistake that you see across parents that they need to eliminate in order to help their children be better with their finances? Kobliner: I think it's lying. [laughs] Whether you have a lot of money and you don't want to confront it because you don't want your kids to know how you feel, or you have very little money, so you might overcompensate, and think, ""I'm going to buy my kid that because I don't want them to miss out."" I think both of those are problems. You don't have to tell your kids everything. You don't have to tell them your income, who makes more, mommy or daddy. I don't think you have to tell them how much you have in your 401(k). There are a lot of questions you don't have to answer, and I have a list of them in my book. But I do think we have to try to be someone honest about the things we do answer. As simple as, you walk in a store, ""Can I have that?"" ""Oh, I don't have any money on me,"" and then you use your card and they see you using your card and they're like, ""Wait, you don't have money on you."" A woman I know told me a story where, just recently, she went out with her kids and forgot her credit card and she had cash and they went to the Gap and they went out to lunch and they said, ""Can we go to the movies, mom?"" And she said, ""I ran out of money."" And they were like, ""Does that mean we're homeless? What do you mean, we've run out of money."" They were little kids, they didn't get that concept of running out. Hartzell: That's great. We'll take your questions here. I have a quick round. We call it a buy, sell, or hold round here. I'll throw out the idea, and you'll let me know whether you going to buy, sell or hold. The first one is autonomous driving vehicles. Would you buy them, sell them, or hold them? In our near future. Kobliner: [laughs] I don't know! What's the expense ratio? Buck Hartzell: Google, Apple? Kobliner: Sure, I guess, it's a good thing to hold. Hartzell: OK, she's a hold on that one. Bitcoin, or other blockchain types of new currencies are you a buy, sell, or hold on these new currencies? Kobliner: I would only say buy because I think they've had such a bad time and they're probably down and probably eventually, maybe, so it's a value -- I don't know any of this. I don't know. Index funds. Ask me another one. Hartzell: OK, the last one. A degree at the University of Michigan for $250,000. Are you going to buy, sell, or hold the Wolverines? Kobliner: I would get a scholarship. My dad, I look back, he got a 0% interest rate loan from this thing called the Hebrew Loan Society. I don't even know what that is, but they gave a 0% interest rate loan for my college. He was a veteran, so he got a VA scholarship for me. I think getting creative and trying to really figure out how you can not get yourself or your kids into huge debt. I'm afraid of the parents who borrow for their kids' college, and the PLUS loan, the parent loan, which allows you to borrow as much as you can, as much as you need. It's really a problem. So, I don't know. I'm like a bad juror, I can't say guilty or not guilty unless I get to -- Hartzell: Well, I'm going to say that's a sell, because Andy Cross, our chief investment officer, went to Michigan, and Ron Gross's daughter, who sits right behind me, is going to Michigan. So I'm going to say it's a sell. Kobliner: It's a great school. Hartzell: No. My wife went to Ohio State, they're rivals. So, that's it for buy, sell or hold. Questions from anybody else in the audience about how to make your children money geniuses? Yes? Audience: You said one of the biggest influences is osmosis, kids watching what you're doing. But if the osmosis is of the wrong kind, how could I as another relative try to overcome that, especially when they live on the other side of the country? Hartzell: Let me ask that, in case they don't hear it. Sometimes kids don't have the right role models what if you're a relative, but not there with them all the time? How can you help out? What can you do to be a good role model from a distance? Kobliner: Right, that's a great question. And you're right, that's an inherent contradiction. You don't need to be a money genius to make your kid a money genius. But it sure is helpful if you're good at money and responsible, to make that. I think, whatever chance you get, talking to the kid. You can't bad mouth their parents, because that's a disaster. But you can say, ""I've been saving."" Again, anecdotes and stories. And saying, ""I'm going to set up a college plan for you,"" and the reason is, we know from research, and this is my favorite piece of research, that when you tell a child that you're saving for their college, they are seven times more likely to go to college, regardless of how much money is in that account. So whether you have $100 or $100,000, kids are more likely. It's the expectation, that you know someone believes in you and is saving for your college. And that's very powerful, and I know of a lot of philanthropic efforts that are starting with that, the notion that the kid knows someone is saving for them and they're more likely to go. And hopefully, they won't get into debt in the process. But, I think, using that, whether, these kids are not in college yet, and encouraging them to, you're going to match, for every $1 they put in, you'll put in $1 or $0.50. Maybe that does go back to making it fun. Having it more like a game. You put in a certain amount and I'll match it. And I think that can be very motivating to kids, without making it like, ""I think your parents are doing a lousy job."" Hartzell: Other questions. Tom? Gardner: We have Foley these two days, she's a 10 year old -- Kobliner: I met her already. She's a little intimidating, but she's very nice. Gardner: A soccer star. She's also somebody who saves what she earns. But, what about the child that saves too much, who maybe doesn't learn how to spend or what to spend on? [...] How do you encourage a child who's very thoughtfully saving, which is so rare, to also use that? Kobliner: To spend it. Hartzell: I should say, the question is, stop and smell the roses. Foley is a great example of somebody who's diligently saving all her money. How do we also enjoy it? Kobliner: OK, can I just ask whose kid is Foley? I met her during my interview, my podcast. Do you know what you're saving for, Foley? Or are you just saving? Good for you, that's awesome. Hopefully you'll hire me one day. [laughs] I'll come to you and you'll be like, ""No, I'm sorry."" I've gotten that question a lot. My husband was worried about our own kids. I would bring them to talks since they were little. My little one was like, ""Oh, I'm so worried!"" I was like, ""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know if I can afford health insurance, mommy, it's so expensive!"" when he was like six. It really was that level. So, in the end, that instinct to save money, at some point, breaks. I think some little kids love to just save. And I don't think that they have to spend when they're little, because instinct kicks in at one point, whether it's when they're in college or out of college. So, I don't worry about that. I look at all three of our kids, they were all voracious savers, and now, my oldest is 21 -- although, one thing that I think we did do well is, for college, we do pay for college for her, and she does work a very little bit in college, but, we've given her spending money, but it's a set amount, and we said, ""This is money."" And sometimes I'm very cynical about it, because I think, when I was a kid, I had four jobs, I worked at the Brown cafeteria, I worked in the Brown student agency doing dry cleaning and so on. And sometimes you have to step beyond yourself and say, ""My kids, we're going to give them some spending money, but that's it. We pay for your books, your college, your healthcare. If you want to take an Uber rather than the New York subway or walk to class, that comes from your money. If you want to go on a vacation with your friends who live in Australia,"" which she wanted to do, she figured out the cheapest flights. So, giving kids ownership of some money as they get older, I think, it makes them -- this is sort of the opposite of what you're asking, but it makes them more careful about spending. But, I've never met a 30 year old -- I mean, I guess there's a rare case of the hoarder who never spends money. But, I think life gets so tempting. Gardner: Why are we laughing in the front row? Audience: Because she's here. Hartzell: Next year is the year, Megan. Kobliner: I think it's great. I would embrace your hoarding tendencies. If you're saving, you have a chunk of money that, one day, there will be a reason. Do you own a home? Audience: No, not anymore. Kobliner: Not anymore. But you will one day. I just think that, having a huge amount of savings is never a bad thing. I was just on a show, I was on ABC or CBS this morning, and the woman said, the host, she was so cute, she took off her shoes and like, ""Look! $24, my shoes! And I got them 20% off!"" And I was like, ""Good for you!"" And she said, ""Do you know why my nail polish just chipped? Because I'm saving money!"" I'm like, ""Good for you!"" We save money, and there will be something that comes along, and you'll know when you want to buy it. I don't know, I have a bias toward saving. Hartzell: There'll be something you want, Foley. I trust you. It could be a shiny gold fidget spinner. Someday. OK, great. Thank you very much, Beth, for joining us. Kobliner: Thank you! These were great questions. Hartzell: And thank you all for coming today. ","
      
    An Interview With Beth Kobliner, Author of ""Make Your Kid a Money Genius""   -- The Motley Fool

348,Emma Court,7132017,MarketWatch,7062017,"Published: July 12, 2017 8:54 a.m. ET Programs that circumvent the coupons target high-cost drugs and are expected to become popular By Co-pay coupons offered by drug makers are controversial. Where patients see a way to reduce or eliminate the out-of-pocket cost of their medications, health plans see a menace that pushes patients to take more expensive drugs. The issue has prompted U.S. government scrutiny, led federal health programs to bar those they insure from using the coupons, and even caused states to limit or consider limiting their use. Health insurers are also firing back, with new programs that target co-pay coupons for pricey drugs. The changes should help health plans achieve a long-desired outcome: curbing rising drug costs. And, because the programs take advantage of co-pay coupons, they could become a lot more expensive for drug manufacturers to offer, potentially changing or even endangering the coupons themselves. Though the new coupon-curtailment programs are in their early days, patients are already paying the price, patient advocates charge. Many of the affected drugs don’t have lower-cost alternatives, they say, and are financially out of reach without co-pay coupons. “This is potentially catastrophic for a lot of rare-disease patients,” said Kollet Koulianos, the National Hemophilia Foundation’s senior director of payer relations. “The cost could prevent them from accessing their medications, period,” which could put at risk the medications’ required regular use. Read:  The real reason drug makers offer discount cards (you’ll pay eventually) A contentious history, and a solution Co-pay coupons have been offered for at least a decade, experts say, and the growth of coupon programs has accelerated in recent years. To some extent, the co-pay coupons work just like any other coupon, by reducing how much a consumer pays at checkout. They can be found in such places as a doctor’s office, online or even in an advertisement. But co-pay coupons also differ in an important way. Because of health insurance, most patients only see a fraction of the cost of their medication. A co-pay coupon works only on that piece, not the drug’s total price tag. Drug makers say that coupons play a critical financial role, especially as health plans increasingly shift costs to consumers. Under a high-deductible health plan, for example, a patient might have to pay $6,000 out-of-pocket before his or her health plan picks up the tab. But others, including industry players and a growing body of research, say that the coupons instead elevate health-care costs. Generally, the more expensive a drug, the more a patient’s wallet feels it. By cutting down or eliminating out-of-pocket costs, coupons subvert those financial incentives to choose the cheaper drug, health insurers and others argue. When co-pay coupons were offered on 23 drugs facing generic competition for the first time between 2007 and 2010, total drug spending increased an estimated $700 million to $2.7 billion more than it would have without coupons, according to a New England Journal of Medicine article published last year. Related:  Why did these generic drugs’ prices jump as much as 85%? Coupons are a marketing expense for drug makers — and one that’s intended to cheat health insurers and employers — in the view of Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University. “It’s a great investment for pharmaceutical companies. If your drug costs $1,000 and the co-pay is preventing patients from getting it, then paying $50 still means you’re making $950 off that prescription,” Fugh-Berman said. “It’s very cost-effective for pharmaceutical companies.” Coupon use also makes it appear that a consumer has met his or her deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. For example, a consumer who uses a $6,000 coupon may appear to have met her $6,000 deductible, though she has in reality paid nothing out of pocket. Related:  This is what your health insurance looks like this year Usually processed through separate systems, coupons are “very hard for us to study,” said Chad Murphy, vice president of pharmacy and strategic programs for Premera Blue Cross, a nonprofit health-insurance company based in Washington state. “We’ve been looking for a solution [for years],” he said. (Premera Blue Cross hasn’t implemented a program to rein in coupon use but is evaluating them, Murphy told MarketWatch.) All of this comes at a time when drug spending is “increasing at a greater rate than any other health-care cost that [employers] have,” said Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer at the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers on health-policy issues in Washington, D.C. That trend is especially true of costly brand-name drugs, she said, many of them specialty drugs that treat complicated or chronic diseases. Companies have previously tried blocking the use of co-pay coupons for certain medications and at certain pharmacies. But the latest approaches have taken a very different tack by instead taking advantage of the coupons, just not to the benefit of consumer out-of-pocket costs.

Pharmacy-benefit managers are able to do this, and to offer the program for free, by requiring that health plans exclusively deal with a certain specialty drug pharmacy. Before the program, a patient using a coupon would very quickly meet her health plan’s out-of-pocket requirements, at which point the coupon would no longer be necessary. Under the change, however, the coupon could be used many more times and the patient would pay more out of pocket, making the co-pay coupon more expensive for the drug maker and reducing the health plan’s total drug costs by an estimated 1% to 3%. The program has attracted a good deal of health-plan interest, experts told MarketWatch. See:  Drug stocks surge on report that President Trump plans to ease industry regulations Prime Therapeutics, a pharmacy-benefit manager owned by 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, began rolling out such a program at the start of this year across several states, according to Chief Clinical Officer David Lassen. “That deductible is meant to be applied. That member is meant to pay something out of pocket,” he said. “By ensuring that that coupon does not apply to the out-of-pocket max, we’re helping to ensure that we’re lowering overall health-care costs.” But for some individuals with rare diseases, this has made it harder to afford their medications. Koulianos, of the National Hemophilia Foundation, said that she knows of about 50 people affected, and that the number is growing. “While we agree that this is in theory a good mechanism to help patients consider, ‘I better take the lower-cost drug’… in this case there is no lower-cost drug,” she said. If patients can’t afford their medications, they could end up in the hospital, or worse, she said. Another new co-pay coupon-circumvention program has a similar goal — taking advantage of drug makers’ coupons — but approaches it differently. The manufacturer coupons are often valued at far more each year or per drug than patients pay out of pocket. So pharmacy-benefit managers adjust the co-pay amount patients pay for certain drugs up to coupon thresholds, to take advantage of the coupon’s total possible value. Only certain drugs will be affected, with expensive cancer and hepatitis C drugs likely targeted, amounting to estimated drug-cost savings of 2% to 4%. But because the program requires making changes to a health plan, it’s expected to have reduced or limited interest. It also raises questions about how those who don’t use co-pay coupons might be affected. Still, some say that, like an endless game of whack-a-mole, the battle over co-pay coupons is unlikely to end anytime soon. “While there may be countermeasures put into place, it will just continue to evolve,” said Premera Blue Cross’s Murphy. “I don’t know if we’ll ever fully solve the issue.” Express Scripts declined to make a representative available for comment.

349,Emma Court,7132017,MarketWatch,7062017,"Published: July 12, 2017 8:55 a.m. ET Gonorrhea is ‘a very smart bug,’ mutating to resist antibiotic treatments By World Health Organization experts warn that it’s “only a matter of time” before the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea is resistant to all current antibiotic treatments. Three cases of untreatable gonorrhea have already been documented in certain countries, the United Nations health agency said, and gonorrhea is already widely resistant to older, cheaper antibiotics. Meanwhile, just three new antibiotics are being developed, “with obviously no guarantee these drugs will make it out of the pipeline,” said Manica Balasegaram, director of the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership. “The situation is fairly grim.” Gonorrhea resistance has become such a big problem because of the bacterial infection itself, which is a “very smart bug,” in the words of the WHO’s Teodora Wi, that’s able to mutate in response to new antibiotics. That tendency is exacerbated by other, outside factors, including incorrect usage or overuse of common antibiotics and use of poor-quality antibiotics, said Wi, the medical officer of the WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research. See:  Would you get tested for STDs by mail? Some millennials are doing just that Gonorrhea affects an estimated 78 million new people a year, and rates appears to be on the rise. In the U.S. About 820,000 new cases are reported annually, according to Planned Parenthood. Left untreated, the bacterial infection can have serious health consequences, including fertility problems and a painful condition called pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Even those who have been treated for gonorrhea can be re-infected. Related:  Untreatable form of gonorrhea may show up in the U.S. This isn’t the first time the WHO has warned about untreatable gonorrhea. About a year ago, the health agency advised doctors to treat the infection using two antibiotics, ceftriaxone — one of two last-resort treatments — and azithromycin, as part of a broader warning about antibiotic resistance to three STIs. It’s also likely that antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea is more common than statistics show. Ten high-income countries have reported cases of gonorrhea resistant to the last-line treatment cefixime, while resistance to another last-line treatment, ceftriaxone, is less commonly reported, according to a report recently published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS Medicine. This suggests that resistance may be occurring in other countries that have less established disease surveillance systems, Wi said. Read:  3 questions to ask before taking antibiotics Of the three new antibiotics being developed, one just finished late-stage clinical trials, and the other two have each completed a midstage trial, according to the WHO’s Thursday release. However, drug makers tend to make relatively few investments in antibiotic development. Because antibiotic regimens are relatively short and gonorrhea and other infections can quickly become resistant to them, the drugs are seen as less lucrative, according to the WHO and other health groups. The WHO and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative launched the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, of which Balasegaram is the director, to address precisely this issue. The partnership is working with the privately held Entasis Therapeutics Inc. to co-develop the antibiotic zoliflodacin in a late-stage global clinical trial, the group and company announced late Thursday. Read:  There’s only one way to prevent sexual transmission of Zika — and it’s not special condoms The drug is the only new antibiotic being developed specifically to treat gonorrhea, they said. In addition to new treatments, many new tools and tactics will be needed to prevent gonorrhea, the health groups said Thursday, including greater use of condoms, better diagnostic testing, improved health-worker education and, in light of evolving antibiotic resistance to drugs, a vaccine.

Typically that process would take 11 days, says Glenn Shapiro, Allstate’s executive vice president of claims. Speed is important because roofing contractors are booked quickly after a big storm hits. “We like the idea of getting our customers to the front of the line,” Shapiro says. Using drones is also safer for insurance company employees. “Giving our adjusters a drone that keeps them on the ground may be more expensive than giving them a ladder, but even one adjuster falling off a roof is one too many,” says Gary Sullivan, vice president of property and subrogation claims for Erie Insurance. Drones can’t be used everywhere. Companies can’t fly drones near airports and military bases. And they’re not the right tool for every type of claim. Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group, says drone footage could be helpful to supplement property inspections but should not replace physical inspections. Bach acknowledges she’s not an expert on drones’ capabilities, but she questions whether a drone could capture the extent of damage the way a human inspector could. “Hail damage can be subtle even when it’s serious,” she says. Insurers by law must get customers’ permission to fly drones on their properties. And Federal Aviation Administration regulations require operators to keep drones within sight. Shapiro of Allstate says an adjuster will get on a roof if a customer wants a traditional inspection or if the drone pictures aren’t sufficient. Insurers began using drones for claim inspections in the past couple of years, especially after new FAA rules for commercial drones went into effect in August 2016. The new rules make it easier to fly legally; drone operators no longer have to have a pilot’s license, for example. The nation’s large home insurance companies are in varying stages of rolling out drones. Ragone says the drone inspection captured the video and pictures for processing his claim quickly. “The whole thing was interesting, and everything was pretty quick,” he says. “We had an estimate for repairs that day.” More from NerdWallet: Barbara Marquand is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

352,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For seven years, U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell vowed to slay Obamacare if only his Republican Party controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. Pull it out “root and branch,” he pledged. The 75-year-old Senate majority leader now has that luxury. But instead of basking in the glow of his first major legislative victory in the Donald Trump era, McConnell is what a source close to the majority leader calls “the man in the middle in an impossible spot.” Late on Monday and again on Tuesday, after a long struggle, McConnell’s efforts to repeal all or portions of former President Barack Obama’s landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act and replace them with less expensive healthcare came crashing down. With 52 Republican senators in the 100-member chamber, McConnell could lose only two of his colleagues on any bill that was opposed by Democrats and still win with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. Three times, he failed to muster the 50 supporters needed. The man who epitomized “the party of no” in Democrats’ eyes during Obama’s presidency, especially when he slammed the door in February 2016 on Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination, fell victim to the “no” of fellow Republicans. “We finally get a chance to repeal and replace, and they don’t take advantage of it,” Trump, six months into his four-year presidential term, said on Tuesday. Across Washington, there was dismay Republicans could not deliver on a promise they assert helped them to assume control in January of Congress and the White House. “I am kind of shocked,” said Republican Representative Dave Brat, of the conservative firebrand House Freedom Caucus that has been a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment. His hand weakened, McConnell could be heading into fierce budget battles, a tax reform fight and a storm over legislation avoiding a government debt default that could shake global financial markets. The result has Democrats feeling emboldened 16 months before the next congressional elections. Around town, the sphinxlike McConnell is known as a master of Senate rules, able to outfox opponents, giving nothing away until he can strike at just the right moment. The senator’s leadership job, a position he yearned for in the years leading up to his 2015 ascension, does not appear to be in jeopardy. But this rocky run calls into question McConnell’s reputation as a master tactician and deal-maker that he earned as Republican minority leader under the Democratic Obama. It is “a real blow to Republicans in Congress generally and to leadership,” said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican. More of the blame sits with the rank-and-file, Lott said. “The problem in Washington today is not lack of leadership. The problem is lack of followership.” Had McConnell succeeded, Lott said he would have been “considered a magician” given the inability of Republicans to coalesce around healthcare legislation for so many years. A Republican operative with ties to McConnell saw a possible silver lining: Failure to pass healthcare could boost chances for tax reform or infrastructure investment if Republicans felt it a more urgent political imperative to rack up a win for Trump before the November 2018 congressional elections. McConnell, a courtly Kentuckian who can appear at pains to speak to reporters nipping at his heels, won accolades in years past for cutting deals with Democrats to keep the government operating and making permanent most of former President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. Those deals involved giving voters government services and lower taxes. But Republican healthcare legislation involves taking something away from millions of lower-income people - their medical coverage. “In part they (Republicans) misunderstood how difficult it will be” to repeal and replace Obamacare, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. Republican rhetoric against Obamacare was so “hyperbolic” it had to take priority early in Trump’s presidency, but senators lacked enthusiasm for legislation, said Daschle, who like Lott lobbies on behalf of healthcare interests. Once boxed into healthcare, McConnell took another controversial step, one that many Republicans questioned. Instead of developing a healthcare bill in public,  McConnell and his top aides, with the advice of a 13-member group of male senators, called the shots. McConnell said hearings were unnecessary, as healthcare policy had been intensively debated since Obama took office in 2009. He said he was listening to suggestions of all of his 51 fellow Republican senators. Many senators felt disconnected and tensions boiled over. As Monday wore on, matters only got worse for McConnell. Republican Senator Ron Johnson publicly accused him of “a real breach in trust” in hard-charging back-room negotiations. He threatened to withhold support for the bill. McConnell supporters argued that no matter how he handled the private negotiations, the Republican leader was dealt a difficult hand from the outset. “The majority leader is trying to keep all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and it’s a tough job but he’s doing a good job,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. And then there was Trump. As McConnell struggled, the president was in France last week celebrating Bastille Day before jetting back to the United States to attend a tournament at his New Jersey golf course. He tweeted about his excitement at the tournament, his disgust with “fake news” and an investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Trump boasted that the White House “is functioning perfectly” and “I have very little time for watching T.V.” Missing, some Senate aides said, was Trump traveling the country in a serious effort to bolster support for McConnell’s efforts.

353,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) - The Trump administration is developing the first comprehensive strategy to defend the United States against disease pandemics and biological attacks by terrorists, the top White House homeland security official said on Thursday. “We have not had as a country a comprehensive bio-defense strategy ever,” White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert told the annual Aspen Security Forum, in Aspen, Colorado. “It’s high time we had a bio-defense strategy.” The effort involves retired Admiral Tim Ziemer, who oversaw the Obama administration’s initiative to fight malaria in Africa, and the White House hopes to publish the new strategy “as soon as we can,” said Bossert, who provided no further details. Bossert noted that the Bush and Obama administrations took steps to address biological threats after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to two Democratic senators and several news organizations in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The spores infected 22 people, five of whom died. But, he added, “There have been a lot of fits and starts in our investments.” “At this point, we need to look clear eyed at the fact that we may have a devastating pandemic influenza or an intentional anthrax attack,” said Bossert. He noted recent news reports that scientists in Canada used commercially available genetic material to construct the extinct horse pox virus, a relative of the small pox virus, which claimed tens of millions of lives before being wiped out. “That’s (horsepox) not going to kill any of us, but that suggests that somebody might now in the future possess the ability to produce synthetic small pox without a live virus and that scares me to death,” he said. The threat of disease pandemics demands global attention, he said. Some experts have criticized the Trump administration for seeking reductions in funding for global health programs that they contend would hurt the country’s ability to prevent and respond to biological threats like pandemics. Bossert, however, said that the administration plans to give “full-throated support” to the Global Health Security Agenda, a partnership of more than 50 nations and international organizations that works to build countries’ capacities to prevent and fight infectious diseases.

354,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With talks to renegotiate the NAFTA trade pact just weeks away, U.S. farm groups and lawmakers from rural states are intensifying lobbying of President Donald Trump’s administration with one central message: leave farming out of it. Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the “worst trade deal ever” in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America’s favor. But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports. Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers. “Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced,” said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado. Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork. Mexico became even more crucial after Trump’s pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers’ hopes of free access to more markets. Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration’s goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer’s list. Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump’s inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trump’s ear. “Our first ask is to do no harm,” said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group. Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August. For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA “would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.” Annual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA. Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers’ case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices. Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture’s cause in NAFTA and beyond. “He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland,” Roberts said. “I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, it’s going to make life much more difficult in farm country,” Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June. In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the “tremendous growth” in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA. “Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,” they warned. Trump’s pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers. “What I really need is a good, solid immigration system,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his state’s low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said. Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers’ angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischer’s Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA. “If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out,” said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion. While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico’s ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump’s “America First” mantra. “The common comment is: ‘why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us?’” said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council. “The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources,” he said. It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that. “I think President Trump is a negotiator,” he said. “I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.” ","

355, ,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"LIGHTING UP: A young man lights a cigarette along a road in New Delhi. Philip Morris says in internal documents it wants to win the ""hearts and minds"" of smokers aged 18 to 24 in India. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi The tobacco giant is pushing Marlboros in colorful ads at kiosks and handing out free smokes at parties frequented by young adults - tactics that break Indiaâs anti-smoking laws, government officials say. Internal documents uncovered by Reuters illuminate the strategy. By ADITYA KALRA, PARITOSH BANSAL, TOM LASSETER and DUFF WILSON Filed July 18, 2017, 11 a.m. GMT NEW DELHIÂ â S. K. AroraÂ spent moreÂ than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the DelhiÂ state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them Indiaâs tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. That included the Indian arm of Philip Morris International Inc, the worldâs largest publicly traded tobacco company. Early last year, Arora said, he met with a Philip Morris director for corporate affairsÂ in India, a man named R. Venkatesh, and told him the signs were an unequivocal violation of Indian law. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Related content Part 1: Treaty Blitz Archive: The Philip Morris Files Video: Delhi raid Video: Marlboro parties Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the companyâs advertising is âcompliant with Indian lawâ and that Philip Morris has âfully cooperated with the enforcement authoritiesâ on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nationâs tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro â the worldâs best-selling cigarette brand â at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the countryâs youth. A key goal is âwinning the hearts and minds of LA-24,â those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of Indiaâs Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morrisâ marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboroâs market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant.Â Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files.Â  Â  Â The companyâs goal is to make sure that âevery adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,â according to another 2015 strategy document. InÂ targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A studyÂ published in the American Journal of Public HealthÂ in 2002 found that during the 1990s,Â âtobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.â With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth. âIndia remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,â says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes.Â Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Philip Morris is not alone in using marketing methods that Indian officials say are illegal. The countryâs largest cigarette maker, ITC Ltd, uses similar tactics, such as advertising at kiosks. British American Tobacco Plc and Indian state-run companies have large, passive stakes in ITC, which controls about 80 percent of the market. Tobacco-control officerÂ Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor,Â sent a letter to Philip MorrisÂ and other tobacco companiesÂ in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements. âLegal action will be initiated against the companyâ if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. A day after Aroraâs deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shopsÂ in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Aroraâs team arrived. JainÂ said the signs had been put upÂ by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morrisâ India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receiptsÂ were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with Indiaâs 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasnât, the companyÂ saidÂ in a statement to Reuters, then âthe relevant government authorities would have initiated action.â Since Aroraâs threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital. But both Philip Morris and ITC say that advertising inside a shop is allowed. Â âAdvertisements of tobacco products at the entrance and inside the shops selling tobacco products are clearly and categorically permitted,âÂ ITC said in response to questions from Reuters. Arora, however, said all advertising is prohibited - âThere are no two ways about it,â he insisted - but he canât start legal proceedings until getting further guidance from the federal government.Â He has yet to receive an answer. Federal health officials say in interviews that the ads are out of bounds.Â Amal Pusp, a director for tobacco control at the health ministry, told Reuters that âthere is no confusionâ: All advertisements - inside and outside shops - are illegal. Â The 2003 law allows tobacco companies to advertiseÂ at shops, but subsequent rules issued by the government prohibit it. âIndia remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy.â In 2004, India became one of the first countries to ratify the World Health Organizationâs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. TheÂ pact has 181 membersÂ and contains a raft of anti-smoking provisions, including tobacco taxes, warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising bans. The country enacted its national tobacco control law the year before ratifying the FCTC, and since then the government has added rules to strengthen the law in line with the treatyâs provisions. The health ministry published rules in 2005Â that banned any display of brand names, pack images or promotional messages. The rule specified that tobacco retailers could only display a 60-by-45 centimeter board, roughly 24 by 18 inches. The signÂ canÂ have a description of the type of tobacco products sold â such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco â but cannot include any brand advertisingÂ and must carry a large health warning. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives The health ministryâs rules were challenged in court by a group of cigarette distributorsÂ and put on hold by a state-level High Court for seven years. They finally came into force in 2013 on orders of Indiaâs Supreme Court. The High Court had overlookedÂ the fact that advertisement of tobacco products âwill attract younger generation and innocent minds, who are not aware of grave and adverse consequences of consuming such products,â the Supreme Court said in its ruling. Philip Morris has lobbied against the passing of stricter tobacco control rules by the Indian government. In documents detailing the companyâs plans for the biennial FCTC treaty convention in India last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as a prime target. AÂ key goal: to pre-empt Modi from taking âextreme anti-tobacco measuresâ before delegates were to gather from around the worldÂ for the treaty meeting, according to a 2014 corporate affairs PowerPointÂ presentation. Reuters reviewed hundreds of pages of internal Philip Morris International documents relating to India. These excerpts show the companyâs marketing and lobbying tactics, which are aimed at bolstering the Marlboro brand among young adults and blocking the âenactment of extreme anti-tobacco measures.â Letters from Indian officials detail the governmentâs efforts to enforce the countryâs tobacco control regulations.

An excerpt from a 2013 letterÂ from a health ministry official to state governments shows specifications for the board that can be displayed at shops selling tobacco products. According to Indian law, the board cannot include any brand names. Beedis are traditional hand-rolled cigarettes. 10. Ahead of the World Health Organizationâs global tobacco control treaty meeting in India last November, Philip Morris planned to engage Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an effort to head off new anti-tobacco measures. The slide is from a 2014 corporate affairs document. CoP7 = Conference of the Parties, the biennial treaty meeting. The company planned to gain Modiâs ear through those close to him.Â It identified several people in this group, including Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda,Â and Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Modi and the other politicians didnât respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris International also didnât comment on the plan. The tobacco giantâs efforts to fend off anti-smoking steps have had limited impact so far. Last year, for instance, India ordered manufacturers to cover 85 percent of the surface of cigarette packs with health warnings, up from 20 percent. The rule, which is still being challenged in a state courtÂ by the tobacco industry, including Philip Morrisâ India partner, was implemented by order of the Supreme Court. Marlboro has just a 1.4 percent shareÂ of the almost $10 billion cigarette market in India. The industry is dominated by ITC, which has a strong grip on distributors and retailers.Â One major method Philip Morris is deploying to gain ground, the marketing documents show, isÂ the free distribution of cigarettes at bars and nightclubsÂ - known as Legal Age Meeting Points, or LAMPs, in company jargon.Â The hiring of young women and men to work at these gatheringsÂ is outsourced to event management companies, according to people with knowledge of the gatherings. Some of the recruiting takes place online. âHey girlsâ¦We are searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for the Marlboro pub activity...Pay: 2000/day...Work: Promotion in clubs in Delhi,â read one postÂ on a Facebook public group in June last year. There was no company name attached to the ad. At severalÂ parties attended by Reuters in Delhi and Mumbai, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out packsÂ of cigarettes. During one party at a nightclub in a Delhi hotel, a young woman walked around with a tablet showing an ad that highlighted Marlboro features. A television screen played a video promoting the brand: âFor trendsetters, for forward thinkers, a smooth and balanced smoking experience.â In many ways, it was right out of the Philip Morris 1990s playbook. The American Journal of Public Health study, drawing on previously secret industry documents, found that Philip Morris ran bar promotions in 1990 using racing jackets, and added âneon message boards and cocktail traysâ in 1991. The study described methods for collecting names for a company database âto generate smoker profiles, direct mailing campaigns, and conduct telephone research studies after the bar events.â At the parties in India, people who took the Marlboro packs were asked their names, ages and preferred brands. Philip Morris calls this distribution of free cigarettes âsampling,â which it says in an internal document is allowed under the law. The company has spent millions of dollars on these activities. In 2014, for example, Philip Morris estimated it spent $1.6 million on LAMP events and sampling at kiosks in India, according to the 2015 commercial review presentation. The company planned to use LAMPs in 2015 to generate 30,000 âtrials,â or samplings of cigarettes. And it planned to generate another 500,000 trials that year through sampling at cigarette shops and kiosks,Â according to the 2015 strategy document. The company instructs employees to watch their words. An undated training manualÂ for market researchers says: âDo not say this is a âPROMOTIONâ or âADVERTISINGâ.â Indian health ministry officials say that anyone who hands out free cigarettes, whatever the circumstances,Â is breaking the law. The Health Ministryâs Amal Pusp says the law against distribution of free cigarettes is unambiguous. He cites Section 5 of the countryâs tobacco control act, which says: âNo person, shall, under a contract or otherwise promote or agree to promote the use or consumption ofâ cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The law carries a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for a first conviction. âWe believe we market our products in a responsible manner, and in compliance with Indian regulations,â Philip Morrisâ Venkatesh said, without elaborating. In October last year, the month before India was due to host delegations from around the world at the biennial FCTC tobacco control conference in Delhi, tobacco-control officer Arora said he suddenly started getting traction. The cigarette ads vanished and Delhi was âcleaned,â he said. That success couldnât have come at a better time for Arora and his colleagues at the federal health ministry: They wanted to make sure foreign delegates visiting India saw the country was serious about its tobacco regulations.

                Special Report: Philip Morris takes aim at young people in India, and health officials are fuming | Reuters",0.9982
357, ,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"Bay Minette, Alabama (Reuters) - Dr. Nicole Arthur, a family practice physician, was trained to avoid Cesarean deliveries in child-birth, unless medically necessary, because surgery increases risks and recovery time. But she has adjusted her approach since arriving last year at the 70-bed North Baldwin Infirmary in rural, southern Alabama. Low patient admissions and high costs mean the hospital does not have doctors on site around-the-clock to administer anesthesia in the case of an unexpected emergency Cesarean. As a result, Dr. Arthur performs the surgery if there are any signs of complication, rather than waiting and running the risk that comes with the 20 to 30 minutes it takes for an anesthesiologist to arrive in the middle of the night. “It’s better for me to do a C-section when I suspect that something may happen,” she said of her new strategy. “Getting the baby out healthy and happy outweighs some of the risk.” Physicians in rural communities across America are facing the same tough choices as Dr. Arthur. Hospitals are scaling back services, shutting their maternity wards or closing altogether, according to data from hospitals, state health departments, the federal government and rural health organizations. Nationally, 119 rural hospitals that have shut since 2005, with 80 of those closures having occurred since 2010, according to the most recent data from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. To save on insurance and staffing costs, maternity departments are often among the first to get shuttered inside financially stressed rural hospitals, according medical professionals and healthcare experts. “It’s been a slow and steady decline,” said Michael Topchik, the National Leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, about maternity ward closings. “It’s very expensive care to offer, especially when it’s lower volume.” More than 200 maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014 because of higher costs, fewer births and staffing shortages, leaving 54 percent of rural counties across the United States without hospital-based obstetrics, data from the University of Minnesota’s Rural Health Research Center show. The trend has escalated recently even though the national healthcare law, known as Obamacare, was designed in part to help rural hospitals thrive. But unpaid patient debt has risen among rural hospitals by 50 percent since the Affordable Care Act was passed, according to the National Rural Health Association, especially in states that decided not to expand Medicaid – the state and federal insurance program for the poor. The outlook for these hospitals was not poised to improve had Congress approved legislation to replace Obamacare. Senate Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid would have pushed about 150 more rural hospitals into the red, according to the Chartis Center for Rural Health, mainly in states that voted Republican in the last election. But late on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican effort to repeal and immediately replace Obamacare will not be successful, after two of McConnell’s Senate conservatives announced that they would not support the bill. The consequences go beyond politics. When local doctors and midwives leave town, rural women lose access to essential services. Many skip or delay prenatal care that could prevent complications, premature birth or even death. The U.S. infant mortality rate is among the highest in developing countries at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births. Pregnant woman in rural areas are more likely to have their deliveries induced or by Cesarean section that, while potentially life-saving, are more expensive and risky than a normal vaginal birth, according to patients, medical professionals and researchers. Almost a year after her second son’s birth, Courtney Cross is still repaying money she borrowed because of the smaller paychecks and larger gas bills she had from driving 60 minutes each way to a specialist in Mobile, Alabama. “There were some days I had to reschedule because of the money factor,” said Cross, a medical technician and mother of two, who some months made the trip multiple times. “I had to make money.” Cross is not alone. The most common reasons for the hospital closures are people and money. More and more people are moving to urban areas in pursuit of work and a better paycheck. And in most states, lower revenue from insurance and U.S. government payments are pushing these hospitals into financial stress, particularly in states that did not build out their Medicaid programs as Obamacare allowed. “The majority of births in rural America are paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid is not the most generous payer,” said Diane Calmus, government affairs and policy manager for the National Rural Health Association. “For most hospitals it is a money losing proposition.” This is the main reason why Connie Trujillo shuttered her midwife practice this spring in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The local hospital had closed its maternity ward, and the closest hospital to deliver babies was at least 60 miles away. She sees more elective inductions because the patients live far away and can’t afford to go back and forth. “Some of them just don’t have the resources,” she said. A year after shuttering, the hospital is trying to hire additional staff to reopen the ward. The number of induced U.S. deliveries nationally has doubled since 1990 to about 23.3 percent, but rates are significantly higher in rural areas, where it is routinely offered to women traveling long distances, especially if the weather is bad. Induced labor and surgery come at a high cost. Commercial insurance and Medicaid paid about 50 percent more for Cesarean than vaginal births, according to a 2013 Truven Health Analytics report. The report said Medicaid payments for maternal and newborn care for a vaginal birth was $9,131 versus $13,590 for a C-section. In largely rural West Virginia - where the Summersville Regional Medical Center became the latest hospital to stop delivering newborns earlier this year - elected inductions for first time mothers rose to 28.7 percent in 2015 from 24.1 percent in 2011, according to data provided to Reuters by the West Virginia Perinatal Partnership, a statewide effort to improve care. ""Inductions allow the physicians to manage their case loads and timing of deliveries,” said Amy Tolliver, director of the Perinatal Partnership. “We know that inductions are happening in small hospitals that have difficulty with staffing."" To address staffing issues at Dr Arthur’s hospital in Alabama, the facility paid temporary doctors for a year to keep the department open when one of its two maternity doctors stopped doing deliveries. “It’s important to have access (to obstetrics),” said hospital president Benjamin Hansert, who also organized a group of doctors from Mobile about 40 minutes away to cover some of the shifts so that staff doctors would not always be on call. “Where the mother goes for care, the rest of the family will follow.” ","

360, ,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A leading Chinese private equity consortium backed by senior executives from Global Logistic Properties (GLP) GLPL.SI won a bid to acquire GLP for S$16 billion ($11.6 billion), marking Asia’s largest private equity buyout in a buoyant sector. The group is offering S$3.38 in cash per share, representing an 81 percent premium over its 12-month volume weighted average price and a 25 percent premium over its last full trading day before the announcement. Surprisingly, the acquisition is not conditional on getting antitrust approvals or a green light from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), among others, at a time when regulators are vetting takeovers more closely. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], which owns 37 percent of GLP and is its biggest shareholder, is supporting the transaction but is free to accept an unmatched superior offer. “GIC played hard to get a decent offer,” said a person with direct knowledge of the deal. “There’s a good premium with very few strings attached.” Last year, GIC nudged GLP to start a strategic review of its business after its shares tumbled over a period of two years starting in 2015. GLP then hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser and Allen & Gledhill as its legal adviser to work on the review. The seven-month auction for GLP was marred by complaints from some potential bidders about a lack of transparency and the perceived advantages of the Chinese consortium through their business ties. GLP then formed a committee of independent directors and said it took measures to alleviate potential conflicts of interest. It said on Friday that it chose the Chinese consortium because it had more deal certainty and “limited conditionality”, reducing “execution risk”. GLP shares soared 22 percent on Friday to a record high. Before Friday’s jump, the shares had surged nearly 50 percent since late last year when GIC requested the strategic review. Analysts said GLP, which earns the majority of its revenue from China, was especially well positioned to benefit from the e-commerce boom. “Their substantial footprint in some of the largest global economies make them well positioned to leverage improving global industrial trade and services, including the rapidly rising share of e-commerce in global retail,” said Priyaranjan Kumar, regional executive director of Cushman & Wakefield’s Asia Pacific capital markets group. “To build a similar platform would take many years and present its own set of economic challenges,” he said. The bid for GLP stands out at a time when China’s outbound M&A volumes nearly halved in the first six months of 2017 following Beijing’s crackdown on capital outflows, data showed, and its new scrutiny of acquisitive groups is set to dampen Asian deal flow further. The proposed acquisition will be done by way of a scheme of arrangement and the Chinese group plans to delist and take the Singapore-listed firm private. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the lead joint financial advisers for the consortium and are providing the financial resources confirmation related to the purchase. DBS Bank and China International Capital Corporation also advised the consortium. Goldman and Citi are putting up $5 bln to help fund the deal, sources said. Goldman and Citi declined comment. ","

361, ,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"TOBACCO TITAN: A cigarette vending machine near the offices of Philip Morris International in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company, which sells Marlboro, is targeting the FCTC anti-smoking treaty on multiple levels. REUTERS/Paritosh Bansal The worldâs largest publicly traded tobacco company is deploying its vast resources against international efforts to reduce smoking. Internal documents uncovered by Reuters reveal details of the secret operation. By ADITYA KALRA, PARITOSH BANSAL, DUFF WILSON and TOM LASSETER Filed July 13, 2017, 11:15 a.m. GMT NEW DELHI/LAUSANNE, SwitzerlandÂ â A group of cigarette company executives stood in the lobby of a drab convention center near New Delhi last November. They were waiting for credentials to enter the World Health Organizationâs global tobacco treaty conference, one designed to curb smoking and combat the influence of the cigarette industry. Treaty officials didnât want them there. But still, among those lined up hoping to get in were executives from Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and British American Tobacco Plc. There was a big name missing from the group: Philip Morris International Inc. A Philip Morris representative later told Reuters its employees didnât turn up Â because the company knew it wasnât welcome. In fact, executives from the largest publicly traded tobacco firm had flown in from around the world to New Delhi for the anti-tobacco meeting. Unknown to treaty organizers, they were staying at a hotel an hour from the convention center, working from an operations room there. Philip Morris International would soon be holding secret meetings with delegates from the government of Vietnam and other treaty members. Related content Part 2: Marlboro Country Archive: The Philip Morris Files Graphic: Lobbying strategy Graphic: Watering down Video: A âreal dangerâ The object of these clandestine activities: the WHOâs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking globally. Reuters has found that Philip Morris International is running a secretive campaign to block or weaken treaty provisions that save millions of lives by curbing tobacco use. In an internal document, the company says it supported the enactment of the treaty. But Philip Morris has come to view it as a âregulatory runaway trainâ driven by âanti-tobacco extremistsâ â a description contained in the document,Â a 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â Â Confidential company documents and interviews with current and former Philip Morris employees reveal an offensive that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia, from hardscrabble tobacco fields to the halls of political power, in what may be one of the broadest corporate lobbying efforts in existence. Details of those plans are laid bare in a cache of Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters, one of the largest tobacco industry leaks ever. Reuters is publishing a selection of those papers in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. Dating from 2009 to 2016, the thousands of pages include emails between executives, PowerPoint presentations, planning papers, policy toolkits, national lobbying plans and market analyses. Taken as a whole, they present a company that has focused its vast global resources on bringing to heel the worldâs tobacco control treaty. Philip Morris works to subvert the treaty on multiple levels. It targets the FCTC conferences where delegates gather to decide on anti-smoking guidelines. It also lobbies at the country level, where the makeup of FCTC delegations is determined and treaty decisions are turned into legislation. Reuters uncovered thousands of pages of internal Philip Morris International documents. These excerpts show the companyâs tactics for combating the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, a treaty aimed at reducing smoking worldwide. (Some documents include highlighting by Reuters; some names have been redacted.) 1. A slide from a 2014 Philip Morris corporate affairs presentationÂ about the FCTC, the global anti-smoking treaty. CoP5 and CoP6 refer to the biennial meetings of treaty nations in 2012 and 2014. âENDSâ refers to e-cigarettes.Â 2. Another slide from the 2014 PowerPoint presentation.Â âParadigm shiftâ refers to an expected boom in what the company calls âreduced-risk products.â 3. A slide from the 2014 presentation shows Philip Morris plans for tracking anti-smoking groups, which the company callsÂ anti-tobacco organizations, or ATOs. 4. The same 2014 document shows objectives for corporate affairs executives. âRoadblocksâ refers to delays in implementing anti-smoking steps. âMoHâ refers to ministries of health. 5. Another slide from the 2014 document shows the characteristics that a Philip Morris corporate affairs (âCAâ) personÂ should possess. 6. A more detailed account of Philip Morrisâ corporate affairs tactics from the same 2014 presentation. 7. A list of methods the company has devised for opposing the implementation of plain packaging, a measure advocated by the FCTCÂ that bars the use of logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. 8. This slide from the 2014 presentation shows some of the resources Philip Morris deployed at the FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow that year (CoP6), as the company looked ahead to the 2016 session in New Delhi (CoP7). ITGA = the International Tobacco Growersâ Association. 9. Philip Morris pushes for more delegates to FCTC treaty meetings from government agencies that deal with economic and trade issues. This slide from the 2014 presentation shows the companyâs plan to lobby for more delegates from outside of public health on Indiaâs delegation at the treaty meeting last year. 10.

In this slide from a Japan corporate affairs presentation, some ministers in the Japanese cabinet are identified according to their positions on tobacco. The two ministers designated âPro-tobaccoâ did not respond to questions from Reuters. 17. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, talks about Philip Morris Japan maintaining good relations with members of Japanâs FCTC delegation, and a Philip Morris executive meeting with members of the countryâs FCTC delegation. (MOF = Ministry of Finance; MOFA = Ministry of Foreign Affairs; JT = Japan Tobacco.) 18. This slide, also from the Japan presentation, reveals the companyâs plans for opposing moves in Australia to bar the use of logos or distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The measure is known as plain packaging, or PP. The Tobacco Institute of Japan, or TIOJ, declined to comment. 19. A slide from a Philip Morris training document. The documents, combined with reporting in 14 countries from Brazil to Uganda to Vietnam, reveal that a goal of Philip Morris is to increase the number of delegates at the treaty conventions who are not from health ministries or involved in public health. Thatâs happening: A Reuters analysis of delegates to the FCTCâs biennial conference shows a rise since the first convention in 2006Â in the number of officials from ministries like trade, finance and agriculture for whom tobacco revenues can be a higher priority than health concerns. Philip MorrisÂ International says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials. âAs a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,â Tony Snyder, vice president of communications, said in a statementÂ in response to Reutersâ findings. âThe fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.â In a series of interviews in Europe and Asia, Philip Morris executive Andrew Cave said company employees are under strict instructions to obey both the companyâs own conduct policies and local law in the countries where they operate. Cave, a director of corporate affairs, said that while Philip Morris disagrees with some aspects of the FCTC treaty and consults with delegates offsite during its conferences, ultimately the delegations âmake their own decisions.â âWeâre respectful of the fact that this is their week and their event,â said Cave in an interview in New Delhi, as the parties to the treaty met last November. Asked in an earlier interviewÂ whether Philip Morris conducts a formal campaign targeting the treatyâs biennial conferences, Cave gave a flat âno.â When the FCTC delegates gather, lives hang in the balance. Decisions taken at the conferences over the past decade, including a ban on smoking in public places, are saving millions of lives, according to researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. Between 2007 and 2014, more than 53 million people in 88 countries stopped smoking because those nations imposedÂ stringent anti-smoking measures recommended by the WHO, according to their December 2016 study. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, the researchers found. According to the WHO, though, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death â and by 2030 will be responsible for eight million deaths a year, up from six million now. There was jubilation among anti-smoking advocates when the treaty was adopted in 2003. The treaty, which took effect in 2005, made it possible to push for measures that once seemed radical, such as smoke-free bars. About 90 percent of all nations eventually joined. A big holdout is the United States, which signed the treaty but has yet to ratify it. Since the FCTC came into force, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Treaty members gather every two years to consider new provisions or strengthen old ones at a meeting called the Conference of the Parties, or COP, which first convened in 2006 in Geneva. But an FCTC reportÂ shows that implementation of important sections of the treaty is stalling. There has been no further progress in the implementation of 7 out of 16 âsubstantiveâ treaty articles since 2014, according to a report by the FCTC Secretariat in June last year. A key reason: âThe tobacco industry continues to be the most important barrier in implementation of the Convention.â Indeed, the tobacco industry has weathered the tighter regulation. There has been only a slight 1.9 percent decline in global cigarette sales since the treaty took effect in 2005, and more people smoked daily in 2015 than a decade earlier,Â studies show. The Thomson Reuters Global Tobacco Index, which tracks tobacco stocks, has risen more than 100 percent in the past decade, largely due to price increases. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle,â said former Finnish Health Minister Pekka Puska, who chaired an FCTC committee last year. âNo way,â he said. âThe tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â With 600 corporate affairs executives, according to a November 2015 internal email, Philip Morris has one of the worldâs biggest corporate lobbying arms. That army, and $7 billion-plus in annual net profit, gives Philip Morris the resources to overwhelm the FCTC. The treaty is overseen by 19 staff at a Secretariat office hosted by the WHO in Geneva. The Secretariat spends on average less than $6 million a year.Â Even when buttressed by anti-smoking groups, the Secretariat is outgunned. Its budget for this year and last year for supporting the treaty clause on combating tobacco company influence is less than $460,000. Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the FCTC treaty Secretariat, is the person tasked with preventing the industry from neutering the agreement. In two interviews at her Geneva office, da Costa e Silva, a medical doctor who holds a PhD in public health and has a dyed pink streak in her hair, explained why the FCTC banned attendance by any member of the public at the 2014 biennial conference in Moscow. The ban came in response to efforts by tobacco executives to use public badges to get inside the venue, she said, adding that industry representativesÂ then started borrowing badges from delegates they knew to gain entry. âItâs a real war,â said da Costa e Silva. âSome people think that with tobacco, youâve won the battle. No wayâ¦ The tobacco industry is more powerful than ever.â But she had only a partial picture of the forces ranged against her.Â She wasnât aware of the fact that Philip Morris had a large team operating throughout the convention in Moscow, or the details of its activities in New Delhi last November. âThis is so disgusting. These are the forces against which we have to work,â da Costa e Silva said in May after being told about the Philip Morris documents. âI think they want to implode the treaty.â The idea of a global tobacco treaty had been discussed among health advocates since at least 1979, when a WHO committee suggested the possibility. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway who became director-general of the WHO in 1998, made it happen. She was aided by outrage over documents that surfaced as part of the landmark 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which the four largest U.S. tobacco companies agreed to pay more than $200 billion to 46 U.S. states. The internal communications showed that tobacco executives lied for years about their knowledge of the deadly nature of cigarettes. A 1989Â document revealed one companyâs plan to fight threats to the industry. âWHOâs impact and influence is indisputable,â the document said. It went on to contemplate âcountermeasures designed to contain/neutralize/re-orient the WHO.â That company was Philip Morris. In 2008, Altria Group Inc split up its Philip Morris business. Philip Morris USA, which remains a subsidiary of Altria, sells Marlboro and other brands in the United States. Philip Morris International was spun off, and handles business abroad. Since the split, Philip Morris International shares have more than doubled and Altriaâs have more than tripled. Philip Morris Internationalâs operational headquartersÂ are in Lausanne, Switzerland, down the street from a patch of Gallo-RomanÂ ruins, in a sleek building with a cafeteria, gym and a patio facing Lake Geneva. From there, the company is working to hobble the treaty. Internal company communications reveal the scope of Philip Morrisâ operation during the 2014 FCTC treaty meeting in Moscow. The company set up a âCoordinating Roomâ that could seat 42 people, according to theÂ 2014 PowerPoint presentation, titled âCorporate affairs approach and issues.â Leading the operation was executive Chris Koddermann. Formerly a lawyer and lobbyist in Canada, Koddermann joined Philip Morris in 2010. He is now a director of regulatory affairs in Lausanne. The PowerPoint describes the ideal corporate affairs executive as someone who is able to âplay the political game.â Koddermann previously worked for federal and provincial cabinet ministers in Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile. Reached on his cell phone in March, Koddermann said he wouldnât be able to meet and that any questions should be directed to Philip Morris International. At the end of the Moscow meeting, on Oct. 18, 2014, Koddermann sent an emailÂ congratulating a 33-person Philip Morris team on their success in diluting or blocking measures intended to strengthen tobacco controls and reduce cigarette sales.Â The gains he touted at the end of the week-long conference were the culmination of a two-year effort, his email said. The documents shed light on one key objective in Philip MorrisâÂ FCTC campaign: Keep tobacco within the ambit of international trade deals, so that the company has a way to mount legal campaigns against tobacco regulations. â¢ Has its roots in a small tobacconist shop in London in 1847.â¢ Now operates in more than 180 markets.â¢ Famous for its iconic Marlboro Man advertising.â¢ Has six of the worldâs top 15 cigarette brands, including Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield.â¢ Spun off from the Richmond, Va.-headquartered Altria Group in March 2008. â¢ Operational headquarters are in Switzerland.â¢ Produces over 800 billion cigarettes a year.â¢ Share price has more than doubled since the 2008 spin-off from Altria. Sources: Philip Morris International website; Reuters reporting In Moscow, one proposal initially called for carving out tobacco from trade pacts. International trade treaties often include provisions, such as the protection of trademarks, that Philip Morris has used to challenge anti-smoking measures. If tobacco were taken out of the treaties, as suggested by the proposal, Philip Morris could be deprived of many such legal arguments. An early draft asked parties to support efforts to excludeÂ tobacco from trade pacts and to prevent the industry from âabusingâ trade and investment rules. In the end, the proposal was watered down. The final decision only reminded parties of âthe possibility to take into account their public health objectives in their negotiation of trade and investment agreements.â There was no mention of excluding tobacco. Koddermann, in his email to colleagues on the last day of the conference, declared victory, describing the change as âa tremendous outcome.â Overall, the company achieved its âtrade related campaign objectives,â including âavoiding a declaration of health over tradeâ and âavoiding the recognition of the FCTC as an international standard,â he wrote. The win was significant. A former Philip Morris employee said the company has routinely used trade treaties to challenge tobacco control laws. The aim, he said, was âto scare governments away from doing regulatory changes.â Even though the tobacco industry has lost a series of major legal battles, its suits have served to discourageÂ the implementation of regulations that curb smoking. Those delays can yield years of unimpeded sales. As the Philip Morris PowerPoint presentation from 2014 put it: âRoadblocks are as important as solutions.â One roadblock was a campaign to stop the 2011 introduction of rules in Australia banning logos and distinctive coloring on cigarette packs. The companyâs litigation and arbitration against the measure ultimately were dismissedÂ â but not before five countries filed complaints against Australia on the same subject at the World Trade Organization. The global trade body has yet to announce a decision in the matter. The attempt to undo Australiaâs regulations has had a chilling effect elsewhere. It slowed the introduction of plain-packaging rules in New Zealand. Citing the risk that tobacco companies may âmount legal challenges,â the government announced in 2013 that it was postponing the move and waiting to âsee what happens with Australiaâs legal cases.â The legislation is now scheduled to go into effect next year. In his Moscow conference email, Koddermann also expressed pleasure at the fate of a proposal on farmers. Initial language would have recommended that countries restrict support for tobacco growers. The proposal was âsignificantly watered down,â he wrote.Â âThis is a very positive result.â Gustavo Bosio, at the time a manager for international trade, chimed in a few days after the conference in an email: âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow.â Philip Morris isnât alone in seeking to weaken the treaty. Ahead of the 2012 FCTC conference, in Seoul, four cigarette giants â Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco InternationalÂ and Imperial Brands Plc â formed an âinformal industry Working Groupâ to oppose various proposals on tobacco taxation, according to anÂ internal BAT documentÂ reviewed by Reuters. The 45-page paper, whose existence hasnât been previously reported, noted that the group would coordinate âto the extent that these issues do not raise any anti-competitive concerns.â The paper outlined a global campaign planned by BAT to counter the FCTC, which was âincreasingly going beyondâ its mandate. And it listed objectives, including a bid to block discussions around the introduction of a minimum 70 percent tax on tobacco. BAT declined to answer questions about the industry working group. Both Imperial and Japan Tobacco International said they didnât want to comment on a document from a competitor. Japan Tobacco International said its tax experts met with counterparts from other tobacco companies to discuss treaty guidelines on taxation ahead of the 2012 conference. Philip Morris did not comment on the document. The Philip Morris emails and documents donât explicitly detail how the company pulled off the victories in Moscow. But they provide insight into the importance it places on wooing delegates. The FCTC traditionally makes decisions by consensus, and so influencing a single national delegation can have an outsized impact. The treaty has a key clause meant to keep the industry from unduly influencing delegations. Article 5.3, as itâs known, says nations should protect their public health policies from tobacco interests. GuidelinesÂ that accompany Article 5.3 recommend that countries interact with the industry only when âstrictly necessary.â But the article â a single sentenceÂ â contains a loophole Philip Morris has exploited. The sentence ends with the words âin accordance with national law,â opening the door to arguments by pro-tobacco forces that any lobbying thatâs legal in a certain country is permissibleÂ when interacting with that countryâs representatives.Â They also argue that a sentence in a related document, the guidelines for Article 5.3, allows for such interactions to take place as long as they are conducted transparently. The Philip Morris International documents uncovered by Reuters include guidelines and country-specific lobbying plans aimed at hobbling the WHOâs global tobacco control treaty and national anti-smoking measures. Strategies include:â¢ Lobbying lawmakers, bureaucrats and other government officialsâ¢ Trying to move tobacco issues away from health departments â¢ Deploying third parties, including retail groups, to make its case and exert pressure on decision-makersâ¢ Engaging the media on tobacco issues and generating public debate to influence decision-makers The tabs below show the companyâs strategy in action in three countries in recent years, according to internal company documents. The extent to which Philip Morrisâ actions affected the outcome in each case is unclear. In September 2011, Israelâs health ministry proposed new measures to regulate flavoring and advertising of tobacco products. In a draft company strategy document from October 2011, Philip Morris said the proposals included âa few excessive and disproportionate measuresâ such as restricting the use of fruit or chocolate flavorings in tobacco products, and broadly prohibiting advertising and marketing of tobacco. Elements of the campaign:1:Â Leverage established relationships with different government ministries, mobilize retailers to advocate against âexcessiveâ provisions, and lobby the health ministry.2:Â Lobby the government through third parties such as an Israel-based supplier of licorice.3:Â Use Philip Morrisâ database of more than 60,000 adult smokersÂ to reach consumers and create a public debate through the media âto influence MPs,âÂ or members of parliament. OUTCOME:Â The bans on advertising and ingredients did not go through. A 2010 Philip Morris document shows the company drawing up plans to lobby Sweden in an effort to influence the European Commissionâs new tobacco regulations for member states, known as the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). Elements of the campaign:1:Â Engage the justice ministry to âput pressureâ on the health ministry so that the Swedish representativeÂ on the European Commission committee opposes plain packaging and âexcessiveâ health warning labels, and supports lifting the ban on snus, a smokeless tobacco product.2:Â Build a âbroad coalitionâ of âthird-party stakeholders,â such as the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, and get them to pressure the government. (The chamber told Reuters that it does not lobby on behalf of individual companies.)3:Â Establish a retailer network and contact bloggers and journalists to voice concerns about issues, including plain packaging and point-of-sale display bans. OUTCOME:Â Plain packaging and point-of-sale display ban were not included in the directive, which came into force in May 2014. In January 2013, Osaka Prefecture in Japan held a public consultation on a proposal to abolish existing smoking rooms, with a âroadmap towards total smoking prohibition in all public places,â according to a February 2014 Japan corporate affairs presentation.Â The Philip Morris document describes it as an âextreme proposal.â Elements of the campaign:1:Â Ensure that ârelevant stakeholdersâ oppose the move. Philip Morris field sales staff engaged retailers and others.2:Â Engage local politicians and work with the industryÂ in pushing back against the proposal. OUTCOME:Â The proposal was withdrawn. One of the companyâs targets has been Vietnam. The day the Moscow meeting ended, Koddermann received an email from his colleagueÂ Nguyen Thanh Ky, a leading corporate affairs executive for Vietnam. Ky said he had a âdebrief lunchâ with the Vietnamese delegation and had a good outcome to report: The delegation was in favor of âmoderate and reasonable measuresâ to be implemented over a âpractical timeline,â he wrote. He did not specify which measures they discussed. The Vietnamese delegation spoke up often during the Moscow meeting. A review of notes compiled by tobacco-control groups accredited as observers showed Vietnamâs interjections frequently mirrored Philip Morrisâ positions on tobacco-control regulations. Just like the tobacco giant, the Vietnamese said a higher tax on cigarettes would lead to more illicit sales. Like Philip Morris, they said the FCTC should stay out of trade disputes. And like Philip Morris, they opposed proposals to set uniform parameters for the legal liability of tobacco companies. The FCTC guidelines on taxation did ultimately include a WHO recommendation for a minimum tax of 70 percent â something Philip Morris opposed. But the proposal to give the treaty more sway over trade disputes was weakened, and measures to strengthen the legal liability of cigarette companies were delayed. Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives As soon as the conference ended, the documents show, Philip Morris turned to the next one: the 2016 meeting in India. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation outlined the need to identify ways to gather intelligence during the Delhi conference. In a separate 2015 planning document, the company talks about the arrangement of farmer protests in the run-up to the meeting. Such protests did take place â including one in front of WHO offices in New Delhi. Reuters couldnât determine whether Philip Morris was behind those demonstrations. While other major tobacco companies also sent people to Delhi in November, Philip Morris was distinguished by its stealth. Executives from the company did not sign in with their tobacco industry colleagues at the FCTC convention center and stayed at a hotel about an hourâs drive away. The anonymity and distance helped Philip Morris approach delegates covertly. On the second day of the conference, a white Toyota van pulled away from the front of the Hyatt Regency hotel â where Philip Morris had its operations room â and headed for the FCTC treaty venue. The van was carrying Ky, its corporate affairs executive from Vietnam. Kyâs driver talked his way past police at the barricade outside the conference center, where FCTC-issued credentialsÂ were checked, explaining that he was driving âVIPs,â the driver later told Reuters. A few minutes later, a man in a dark suit walked out of the conference center, passed the van and stopped at a street corner. The van did a U-turn, and a Reuters reporter saw the man in the suit quickly climb in. He was a senior member of Vietnamâs delegation to the FCTC conference: Nguyen Vinh Quoc, a Vietnamese government official. The driver, Kishore Kumar, said in an interview that he dropped the two men off at a local hotel. Kumar said that on several other occasions that week, he took Ky to pick up people from the Hotel Formule1, a budget lodging where Vietnamâs delegation was staying during the conference. Ky and Quoc did not respond to requests for comment. Asked by Reuters about the interaction between Ky and the Vietnam representatives, Philip Morris executive Andrew CaveÂ thumped on the table in a bar at the hotel where company representatives were staying. Reuters should focus, he said, on efforts by the industry to develop so-called reduced-risk products â those that deliver nicotine without the burning of tobacco and which the company says reduce harm. When pressed about the meetings with Vietnam, Cave thumped the table again: âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â In a subsequent email, Cave said: âRepresentatives from Philip Morris International met with delegates from Vietnamâ during the Delhi conference âto discuss policy issues and this complied fully with PMIâs internal procedures and the laws and regulations of Vietnam.â Delegates, Cave said inÂ separate interviews, are reluctant to meet openly with Philip Morris because they are afraid of being ânamed and shamedâ by anti-smoking groups. Some delegates questioned the extent to which Philip Morris shaped the decisions made at the Moscow conference, saying attendees genuinely disagreed on certain issues. Nuntavarn Vichit-Vadakan, a Thai delegate, oversaw many discussions as the chair of an FCTC committee at the Moscow conference. She said delegates differed over the regulation of e-cigarettes, for instance, and any lobbying the company carried out would not have determined the outcome. The Philip Morris documents leave questions unanswered. In some cases, the documents show the company hatching plans to change an anti-smoking regulation or to monitor activists, but donât always make clear to what extent or how the plans were executed, if at all. The 2014 PowerPoint presentation called for âachieving scrutinyâ of tobacco control advocates and said a âglobal project teamâ had been established for this purpose. It did not list what means would be used. In some instances, Philip Morrisâ lobbying plainly failed. In July 2015, the Ugandan parliament passed sweeping new anti-tobacco laws inspired by the treaty. All that was needed was President Yoweri Museveniâs signature, and the small African nation would become a leader on the continent in implementing a strict interpretation of the FCTC. Philip Morris sent an executive, a younger white man, to tell the septuagenarian president, who long ago had helped topple dictator Idi Amin, why the tobacco act was a bad idea. Sheila Ndyanabangi, Ugandaâs lead health official for tobacco issues who was present at the meeting, described the executiveâs approach as lecturing the statesman. âHe said, âUgandan tobacco will be too expensiveâ and âit will not be competitive,ââ Ndyanabangi said. Her account was confirmed by a senior Ugandan government official who was also present. Museveni stared for a moment at the Philip Morris executive and a representative from a major tobacco buyer whoâd come with him. The president then declared: âSlavery ended a long time ago.â There was a long silence in the room, recalled Ndyanabangi. Museveni said Uganda didnât need tobacco, and the meeting was over. The president signed the bill that September. Museveniâs office did not respond to requests for comment. Over time, however, the industryâs lobbying has slowed the treatyâs progress. At the biennial conferences, the discussions have changed. In Moscow, for instance, there was a strong focus on trade and taxes. âYou could see from the floor that interventions were very, very, very much focusing on the trade aspects, many times even putting trade over health,â the FCTCâs da Costa e Silva said in an interview last year. The composition of FCTC delegations sent by governments has changed to include more members who arenât involved in health policy. Thatâs in line with what Philip Morris and other tobacco companies want: Philip Morris, as well as British American Tobacco, has sought to move the balance of the membership away from public health officials and toward ministries like finance and trade. Such agencies, said the former Philip Morris executive, benefit from tobacco tax revenues and attach less weight to health concerns. âThe health department would just want tobacco to be banned, while for the finance ministry itâs more like how can we leverage or get as much money as we can,â he said. The object of Philip Morrisâ efforts, according to the 2014 PowerPoint on corporate affairs, is to âmove tobacco issues awayâ from health ministries and demonstrate there are broader public interests at play â that âitâs not about tobacco.â Cave, the Philip Morris corporate affairs executive, confirmed the company tries to persuade governments to change the composition of delegations. Health officials, he said, arenât equipped to handle the intricacies of issues such as taxation. âYouâre looking at illicit trade, youâre looking at tax regimes, youâre looking at international law,â he said. âNow each of these areas, itâs logical, if you want to really tackle the trade and tobacco smuggling, illicit trade, who would you go to? You wouldnât go to the health ministry.â âIâm angry that youâre focusing on that, rather than the real issues that matter to real people.â Reuters analyzed the rosters of the almost 3,500 accredited delegation members who have attended the seven FCTC conferences since 2006. The analysis found that there were more than six health delegates for every finance-related delegate in 2006. In Delhi last year, that ratio had fallen to just over three health delegates for every finance delegate. The number of delegates from finance, agriculture and trade fields has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. Vietnamâs delegation, for example, has changed markedly. At the first FCTC conference in 2006, none of its four delegates were from finance or trade ministries. By 2014, in Moscow, there were 13 delegates, with at least four from finance-related ministries, including the chief delegate.Â Vietnamâs foreign ministry did not respond to questions about the delegation. Da Costa e Silva isnât opposed to having delegates from trade ministries, but she says their primary focus needs to be on health.Â And she was concerned by the makeup of the Vietnamese delegation. In a letter to the Vietnamese prime ministerÂ in late 2015, she asked that tobacco industry employees be excluded from the delegation. If they werenât, she wrote, Vietnam might be âunable to play a full part in discussions.â In 2016, VietnamÂ brought 11 delegates to the conference, of whom six were from health agencies, including the chief representative. Some tobacco-control activists who attended the Delhi meeting in November say it was the worst so far in terms of passing new anti-smoking provisions. Matthew Myers, who heads the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said multiple countries came prepared to consciously block action. He said he heard delegates making arguments âI havenât heard in 25 years.â A Nigerian delegate, for instance, asked to remove a reference to âthe tobacco epidemicâ from a draft proposal on liability for tobacco-related harm, according to notes taken by anti-smoking groups. Asked for comment, Christiana Ukoli, head of the delegation in Delhi, said the âNigerian delegation strongly dissociates itself from [that] statement.â The Delhi conference ended as it began, with treaty Secretariat officials not knowing where Philip Morris had been or what it had done. The company had flown in a team of executives, used a squad of identical vans to ferry officials in New Delhi, and then left town without a trace. Just days after the FCTC conference in Moscow ended in October 2014, Philip Morris executive Gustavo Bosio sent an email to colleagues highlighting what he said was the companyâs success in pushing back on three treaty proposals related to trade issues. âThese excellent results are a direct consequence of the remarkable efforts of all PMI regions and markets during the past two years and throughout the intense week in Moscow,â wrote Bosio, then manager for international trade.

362, ,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A crisis between Qatar and four Arab countries is straining a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s government in a two-year war against Iranian-aligned Houthis and slowing the alliance’s military advances. At the heart of the crisis is the accusation that Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that coalition mainstays Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have designated a terrorist group. But Yemen’s government is packed with supporters of the Islah party, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, threatening the unity of the alliance which has already been weakened by the withdrawal of Qatar’s forces after the row erupted on June 5. “The Gulf rift has cast a shadow on the government and could split it as ministers linked to Islah sympathise with Qatar,” a senior official in the Yemeni government, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The coalition is seeking to restore the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and backs forces fighting Houthi rebels and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Fighting near the Red Sea port city of al-Mokha, where a UAE-backed offensive was being prepared on the port of Hodeidah which handles most of Yemeni food imports, has slowed. “The fighting has been frozen since the start of the dispute with Qatar, which reflects the extent of the UAE concerns over the strength of Islah in the province,” a local official told Reuters. UAE officials did not respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia currently hosts the exiled Yemeni government which includes five cabinet ministers from the Islah party. The chief of staff also belongs to Islah and Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar is a close Islah ally. The party also has thousands of followers fighting against the Houthi forces who control the capital Sanaa with Saleh loyalists. Unusually in Yemen’s fractured political landscape, Islah has supporters in the north and south of the country. Since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood, in deference to the government-in-exile’s Saudi hosts. The coalition depends heavily on Islah fighters on the ground. “Whatever Saudi Arabia’s current view of the Muslim Brotherhood in other countries, in Yemen they are natural allies against the Houthi-Saleh alliance,” April Longley Alley, a senior Arabian Peninsula analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG) said. “In many fighting fronts in the north, tribesmen or soldiers associated with Islah are a critical, if not the most important, part of the anti-Houthi fighting force.” Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment. The Brotherhood has posed a big challenge to Arab rulers in the Middle East, where it has built a strong base opposed to the principle of dynastic rule. While Qatar has supported the movement, Gulf monarchies and emirates, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have spent billions trying to prevent the Brotherhood holding power in the Arab world since 2011 uprisings swept the region. The UAE, a crucial member of the coalition and which is more hostile to the Brotherhood than other members, appears to have been the most uncomfortable about its military fighting alongside Brotherhood-linked Islah forces. The UAE has also built a southern army that remains under the influence of southern Yemeni politicians who are hostile to the Brotherhood’s ideology and want to break with the north. On the frontlines in the south, the offensive against the Houthis and Saleh forces has slowed down because of the UAE position on Islah, local officials said. UAE officials were not available to comment. Fighting in the two strategic provinces of Taiz and Marib has halted for more than a month, except for occasional air strikes and naval shelling on the rebels. Cracks in the Yemeni government on the Qatar crisis were  highlighted when the quarrel broke out with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposing travel and diplomatic sanctions on Qatar. Yemen’s government rushed to express solidarity with Qatar on the state news agency website. Within two hours that message of support was wiped off. The next day the government cut ties with Doha, falling into line with Saudi and the others. ","

363, ,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"BOGOTA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Congress in the Dominican Republic rejected upholding the nation’s total ban on abortion this week, approving a step that would allow the procedure for ending life-threatening pregnancies and those resulting from rape or incest. The lawmakers in the lower house voted against a decision in May by the Dominican Senate, which turned down recommendations made by President Danilo Medina to amend the criminal code and ease the nation’s abortion ban. The Dominican Republic is one of seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that have absolute bans on abortion. The decision by the Dominican Congress on Tuesday would allow abortion in cases of rape or incest, when a mother’s life is in danger or when a foetus would not survive the pregnancy. The contrasting decisions in each house pave the way for another vote to be introduced. Hopes have been raised among abortion rights activists that the country’s ban on abortion - dating back to 1884 - can be finally repealed. “The vote has shown a clear majority of house representatives standing with Dominican women’s fundamental rights to decide over their bodies and to be treated with dignity. This must be celebrated,” Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at rights group Amnesty International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The earlier vote by the Senate “would have virtually maintained a full ban on accessing abortion services ... in a context of high rates of unsafe abortions, maternal mortality and adolescent pregnancies,” he said. It is not clear when a new vote on the ban will occur, and it could be months before lawmakers start debating the controversial issue again, campaigners say. As in the past, moves to repeal the ban will face staunch opposition from conservative groups and the influential Catholic Church. Janet Camilo, the country’s minister for women, has said the abortion ban is a health care issue for women and decisions not to repeal it were based on sexism. Blanket abortion bans put women’s lives at risk by forcing women to undergo dangerous backstreet abortions, which were the cause of at least one in 10 maternal deaths in Latin America in 2014, according to Amnesty International. In recent years, the United Nations has urged the Dominican Republic to lift its abortion ban. Activists say the country should seize the opportunity to allow women to access a safe abortion in a country where more than 90,000 unsafe abortions occur each year. “Now it’s imperative that Dominican lawmakers ensure that the new penal code proposed guarantees human rights and access to justice for all girls and women,” said Catalina Martinez, Latin America director at the U.S.-based Center of Reproductive Rights.

364,,7202017,Investopedia,7132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid, as mandated by federal law. The minimum wage is a legally mandated price floor on hourly wages, below which non-exempt workers may not be offered or accept a job. As of 2017, the federal minimum wage rate in the United States is $7.25 per hour. This means that it is illegal for an American worker to sell their labor for less than $7.25 per hour unless the worker falls into a category specifically exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Minimum wage laws were first used in Australia and New Zealand in an attempt to raise the income of unskilled workers. Most modern developed economies and many underdeveloped economies enforce a national minimum wage. Examples of countries with no established minimum wage include Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Singapore. Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may also pass different minimum wage requirements as long as the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. An employer who is subject to the federal and state minimum wage requirement must pay the higher of the two. States will usually set a minimum wage that is reflective of the cost of living in the region. For example, the state of Massachusetts has a minimum wage of $11 per hour, compared to Arkansas which has a minimum wage rate of $8.50. As of 2017, minimum wage rates exceeded the federal rate in 29 of the 50 states, led by Massachusetts and Washington at $11 per hour. Some states like Alabama, New Hampshire, and South Carolina have no state minimum wage. Cities and municipalities may also set a minimum wage for their residents which must be higher than the federal minimum wage. For example, even though the state of Illinois set its minimum wage at $8.25, the city of Chicago has a minimum wage of $11.00. The government periodically assesses the federal minimum wage level for changes in inflation or cost of living. The table shows the minimum wage set at each state level. Some states have set their minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage, others have set the same minimum wage as the federal rate, and a select few don't have a minimum wage requirement. In the latter case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 will apply. Like all price floors, a minimum wage law only has a measurable effect when set above the market clearing price for a transaction. For example, a minimum wage of $10 per hour will have no effect for workers whose marginal productivity in a given line of work is greater than $10 per hour. The legal supply and demand remains unchanged for such labor. For those with a marginal productivity less than $10 per hour, however, a $10 per hour minimum wage creates an artificial shortage of profitable labor. An unskilled worker with a marginal productivity of $8 per hour in California or Massachusetts can only offer to work at a loss to his or her potential employer — that is, the employer can only hire the worker if they are willing to pay more in salary than marginal revenue produced by the worker, or unless the employer incorrectly estimates the worker’s marginal productivity to be above $10 per hour. Several groups of individuals are exempt from being paid the minimum wage. Individuals that fall into these groups are usually paid below the minimum wage in order to incentivize companies to hire them. Low-skilled laborers in the United States can be exempted from the minimum wage if a sizable portion of their income is derived from tips. If exempted, a lower minimum wage of $2.13 per hour applies to tipped employees who regularly receive more than $30 in tips per month, or if the total tips retained in addition to the hourly wage rate is equal to or greater than the federal minimum wage. In a case where the employee’s total tips and hourly rate falls below the minimum wage, the employer is expected to compensate the employee for the shortfall. A full-time student working for a university, retail store, or service establishment can be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. Although students may work up to 8 hours per day, they cannot work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. In addition, students in a technical or vocational program can be paid not less than 75% of the minimum wage throughout their active enrollment in the program. Workers below 20 years of age may be paid $4.25 per hour by federal law, until they pass the three-month probationary period, after which the employer must convert their pay structure to the federal minimum wage rate. Finally, workers with physical or mental disabilities can be paid less than the federal minimum wage according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Disabilities which can affect production capacity include blindness, cerebral palsy, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and developmental disabilities. There is a high elasticity of demand for low-skilled labor. This means that a small change in the price for low-skilled labor tends to have a large effect on its demand. For these reasons, too high a minimum wage can lead to increasing unemployment among the low-skilled. In modern times, the proliferation of improved technology also increases the marginal rate of technical substitution for low-skilled labor. When the cost of labor increases, companies find it increasingly profitable to switch to labor-replacing technology, such as the decision made by Wendy’s Co. in 2016 to introduce self-serve kiosks in response to higher minimum wage laws.

An unskilled worker with a marginal productivity of $8 per hour in California or Massachusetts can only offer to work at a loss to his or her potential employer — that is, the employer can only hire the worker if they are willing to pay more in salary than marginal revenue produced by the worker, or unless the employer incorrectly estimates the worker’s marginal productivity to be above $10 per hour. Several groups of individuals are exempt from being paid the minimum wage. Individuals that fall into these groups are usually paid below the minimum wage in order to incentivize companies to hire them. Low-skilled laborers in the United States can be exempted from the minimum wage if a sizable portion of their income is derived from tips. If exempted, a lower minimum wage of $2.13 per hour applies to tipped employees who regularly receive more than $30 in tips per month, or if the total tips retained in addition to the hourly wage rate is equal to or greater than the federal minimum wage. In a case where the employee’s total tips and hourly rate falls below the minimum wage, the employer is expected to compensate the employee for the shortfall. A full-time student working for a university, retail store, or service establishment can be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. Although students may work up to 8 hours per day, they cannot work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. In addition, students in a technical or vocational program can be paid not less than 75% of the minimum wage throughout their active enrollment in the program. Workers below 20 years of age may be paid $4.25 per hour by federal law, until they pass the three-month probationary period, after which the employer must convert their pay structure to the federal minimum wage rate. Finally, workers with physical or mental disabilities can be paid less than the federal minimum wage according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Disabilities which can affect production capacity include blindness, cerebral palsy, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and developmental disabilities. There is a high elasticity of demand for low-skilled labor. This means that a small change in the price for low-skilled labor tends to have a large effect on its demand. For these reasons, too high a minimum wage can lead to increasing unemployment among the low-skilled. In modern times, the proliferation of improved technology also increases the marginal rate of technical substitution for low-skilled labor. When the cost of labor increases, companies find it increasingly profitable to switch to labor-replacing technology, such as the decision made by Wendy’s Co. in 2016 to introduce self-serve kiosks in response to higher minimum wage laws.

The insurer's results come after a second attempt to pass a health-care legislation in the Senate collapsed late on Monday, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling for an outright repeal of Obamacare and others seeking a change in direction toward bipartisanship. Last year, UnitedHealth pulled out of the 2017 Obamacare individual exchanges and took charges for the plans. The insurance, which was set up as part of former President Barack Obama's health reform law, had higher cost members than expected last year and many insurers lost money. UnitedHealth, which sells employer-based insurance as well as Medicare and Medicaid plans, said net earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $2.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $2.46 per share, beating average estimate of $2.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mizuho Securities USA analyst Sheryl Skolnick said UnitedHealth 'means' outstanding execution, but this quarter seems particularly good. Revenue from its Optum business, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, rose about 10 percent to $22.67 billion. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $50.05 billion, largely in line with estimates. The insurer said its withdrawal from Obamacare individual markets, combined with the health insurance tax deferral, reduced second-quarter revenue by about $1.8 billion and lowered revenue growth rate by 4.5 percent. The company said medical care ratio of 82.2 percent increased 20 basis points year-over-year, as a 150 basis point increase from the health insurance tax deferral was offset by an improved business mix, product performance. Medical ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with the insurance premiums that it brings in. That the medical care ratio has been well controlled recently, especially since the exit from the exchanges ... makes us even more comfortable that the company is years ahead of peers, Skolnick wrote in a note. The company raised its forecast for 2017 net earnings to $9.20 to $9.35 per share and adjusted net earnings to $9.75 to $9.90 per share. UnitedHealth had earlier forecast earnings of $9.10 to $9.30 per share and adjusted earnings of $9.65 to $9.85 per share. ",Insurer UnitedHealth's quarterly profit rises 30 percent,0.9946

Amir Rubin, an executive vice president in UnitedHealth's Optum division, was named to the top post on Tuesday. Tom X. Lee, who founded One Medical and ran the company for a decade, will stay on as executive chairman. Rubin said he intends to spend his first few months building out the business by opening new clinics and signing up more corporate customers. One Medical sells memberships to individuals as well as to companies that offer its primary care service as a benefit. ""We have seen a tremendous (revenue) growth in our corporate relationships,"" Rubin said in an interview. Individual members pay an annual fee of $149 to $199 and get access to same-day appointments that they can book online or with the mobile app. Corporate rates vary based on the number of employees and the extent of their benefits. Rubin, who was previously CEO of Stanford Health Care, expects the enterprise business to become a bigger part of One Medical's overall revenue. One way the company is attracting large employers is by opening small clinics on corporate campuses, similar to a model used by start-ups like Crossover Health. One Medical has raised more than $180 million in financing from investors including Benchmark and Alphabet's GV. In addition to online scheduling, the company offers a virtual medical team, a suite of mobile apps and has built its own electronic medical system. Rubin has no immediate plans to raise further rounds of financing even with the company's ""ambitions for continued growth."" Rubin didn't rule out future acquisitions of digital health start-ups. In 2016, the company bought Rise, a nutrition coaching app, to bolster its digital medicine offerings. Rubin also said he ""doesn't anticipate"" a sale to a major health system, despite a clear trend in the market toward consolidation. The company declined to share its valuation, though it's reportedly worth at least $1 billion. Correction: This article originally missatated Rubin's title at UnitedHealth.

368,Elizabeth Gurdus,7202017,CNBC,7132017,"The GOP's failure to pass health care reform has shaken the market, so much so that Jim Cramer made the case for cordoning off Wall Street from Main Street. While Wall Street obsesses over the FANG stocks, Cramer's acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, for being the few plays immune to Washington's turmoil, strong earnings reports are overlooked or even met with disdain. ""That's why I want to sing the praises of a bunch of companies that have reported this earnings season, companies that would be getting a lot more attention and love right now if Washington wasn't making us feel so pessimistic, so cynical,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. One such company was UnitedHealth. The largest health care provider in the country, UnitedHealth reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, topping the Street's estimates. Cramer's go-to UnitedHealth analyst, Mizuho Securities' Sheryl Skolnik, called it ""an outstanding report,"" but the stock closed up only 0.2 percent, a mere 50 cents. ""Don't let its measly 50-cent gain fool you,"" Cramer warned. ""United Health reported a great quarter. Its stock's a buy."" The technology sector may be seen by the stock market as the hotbed of growth and the rally's main driver, but Cramer wanted to put its performance into context. ""It's not like tech is vaulting into the stratosphere while everything else does nothing,"" Cramer said. ""What we have here is a broad-based rally that's taking up all sorts of stocks, proving once again that diversification is the only free lunch in this business."" In the last six months, the tech stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 15 percent on average, but the health care stocks rose over 13 percent, with industrials, materials and financials up 8 percent. So Cramer used the charts of technician Bob Moreno, publisher of RightViewTrading.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, to highlight some of the overlooked sectors' top names. In light of Netflix's strong earnings report, Cramer knows CEO Reed Hastings understands three things: content can be king, people love bargains, and bigwig money managers will invest in internet stocks with promise. ""Netflix is, to the naked eye, a two-pronged success. If your company can produce local content that people love worldwide and you only charge them $8 or €8 a month, you'll land and expand. You'll grow and grow and grow,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. But the third element, the willingness of Wall Street financiers to catch and pay for the next hot internet-related trend, was what really drove Hastings' success so far, Cramer said. Cramer also analyzed the action in Straight Path Communications, using the stock's moves to make the case that markets are not, as some economic theories say, perfectly efficient. Verizon recently announced it would buy Straight Path, which owns bandwidth licenses for 5G networks, for $184 a share after a bidding war with AT&T that sent the stock price soaring from $36, where it stood before the bids began. ""The action in Straight Path Communications has been very exciting, but I wouldn't call it efficient,"" Cramer said. ""The reason you can make money in individual stocks — as long as you do the homework — is that markets are rarely super efficient, the conventional wisdom is often wrong, and there are often huge opportunities there for the taking if you know where to look. Straight Path had a lot going against it, sure, absolutely, but at the end of the day they owned some insanely valuable spectrum assets that ultimately made AT&T and Verizon willing to pay through the nose to buy the whole company. That's what really mattered."" Finally, Cramer spoke with Hamid Moghadam, the CEO of warehouses real estate investment trust Prologis, to check in on the REIT space and see how the industry is building on the rise of e-commerce. ""It's really broader than e-commerce,"" Moghadam told Cramer on Tuesday. ""I mean, it's all consumption-related and, you know, supply has been very disciplined in the last couple of years and demand has been really strong, so the combination of those two [has] made the best market of my career."" And as data becomes increasingly important to technology companies working on the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, Moghadam said his company is well-positioned to take advantage of the information boom. ""I think in 10 years we're going to think about our businesses, not just the real estate business, but also a very significant data business, and I think that data is going to help our customers, it's going to help our own decision-making, and who knows? If we're really successful at this, it could be a separate business that could be valued separately by the market,"" the CEO said. ""It's way too early to get that far ahead of our speed, but I'm really excited about those opportunities."" In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks, including: United Parcel Service: ""UPS is getting its act together and they are levered to e-commerce. No, you don't want to sell. We're not going with that. We like UPS."" McKesson Corporation: ""I have to tell you, long term buy.

369,Christine Wang,7202017,CNBC,7132017,"A new official analysis released Wednesday finds that repealing much of Obamacare without a replacement law would increase the number of people without health insurance by 32 million people, double insurance premiums in the individual plan market and leave most of the United States without an insurer selling such plans by 2026. The report comes as Republican leaders in the Senate, desperate to pass some kind of health-care law, have said that next week they might consider a possible Obamacare repeal bill that could eventually be amended to include a replacement. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that with a repeal-but-no replacement bill the number of uninsured is expected to be 17 million higher than if Obamacare remains in place. And by 2020 there would be 20 million more uninsured people, CBO said. That tally would grow to 32 million by 2026, the report said. The projections assume the end of the Obamacare rule requiring most Americans to have insurance or pay a find, the end of subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy individual plans, and an end in 2020 to federal funding for the expansion of Medicaid to more poor adults under the Affordable Care Act. In January, CBO had issued a report with similar estimates, which were based on a bill passed by Congress in 2015, which was vetoed by then-President Barack Obama. Like that report, the new CBO analysis is almost certain to make it politically difficult, if not impossible, for Republican Congressional leaders to pass a repeal bill without having a replacement bill in hand at the same time. The CBO has not yet issued a report on the leading Senate bill to replace Obamacare, which does not have enough GOP senators to pass at the moment. Tweet The CBO's new report projected that a repeal-without-replacement would lead average premiums in the individual health insurance market to rise by about 25 percent relative to the current Obamacare law next year. That increase ""would reach about 50 percent in 2020, and premiums would about double by 2026,"" the CBO report found. Those premium hikes would occur in the ""non-group market,"" or the private insurance market that serves people who do not get insurance through an employers. Tweet And CBO said that ""about half of the nation's population would live in areas having no insurer participating in the nongroup market in 2020 because of downward pressure on enrollment and upward pressure on premiums."" ""That share would continue to increase, extending to about three-quarters of the population by 2026,"" the report said. CBO also said that repealing many provisions of the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is formally known, would decrease federal deficits by $473 billion from 2017 through 2026. Republican leaders in the Senate have unsuccessfully struggled for weeks to pass a bill that would replace large parts of Obamacare, and a frustrated President Donald Trump in reaction suggested Monday that Obamacare be repealed outright. Tweet The Senate  next week expects to consider a bill to either replace Obamacare, or repeal it, and then allow a replacement to be crafted later. During a lunch meeting Wednesday, Trump pushed Senate Republicans to forge an agreement on health-care legislation before leaving town for the August recess. ""We have to stay here. We shouldn't leave town, and we should hammer this out and get it done,"" the president said. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said, in reaction to the CBO report, said, ""Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan would have disastrous effects on people's lives and our health care system."" ""This course of action is just a hasty and reckless attempt by Republican leadership to make good on a campaign slogan when, instead, we should focus on working together across party lines to do what President Trump has said time and time again he wants to do: provide better health care at a lower cost for every American,"" Carper said.

370, ,7202017,CNBC,7132017,"China's Dalian Wanda Group did not fund a spate of deals made by AMC Entertainment Holdings, the U.S. cinema chain majority owned by Wanda said late on Tuesday, after reports that Beijing was cracking down on the Chinese firm's overseas deals. AMC's shares dived over 10 percent on Monday after sources said regulators in China had told banks to stop providing funding for several of Dalian Wanda's overseas acquisitions amid broader curbs on companies moving funds overseas. The curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focused on six overseas deals, four of which have already been completed, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed. AMC said deals for Starplex Cinemas, Odeon & UCI Cinemas, Nordic Cinema Group and Carmike Cinemas completed between 2015 and earlier this year were fully funded by the firm's own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks. ""At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theater purchases,"" AMC said in a statement. Wanda bought AMC for $2.6 billion in 2012, part of a broader push by the Chinese company firm into cinemas. The cinema chain added it had also never ""never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose, including for acquisitions"". The most recent four deals were funded by loans from syndicates of U.S. banks taken out by AMC and from AMC's own cash reserves. Beijing is on a major drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year. Rooted in property, Wanda is one of a handful of Chinese conglomerates that have expanded aggressively abroad over the past few years, into areas beyond their original business. It is controlled by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin. AMC's chief executive Adam Aron said in the statement that Wanda ""does not actively participate in the day-to-day running of AMC"" beyond its three seats on the company's board. ""AMC is an American company run from its Leawood, Kansas, headquarters by our management teams located in the U.S. and Europe,"" he said.

371, ,7202017,CNBC,7132017,"A secretive U.S. government panel has objected to at least nine acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign buyers so far this year, people familiar with the matter said, a historically high number that bodes poorly for China's overseas buying spree. The objections indicate that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, is becoming more risk-averse under President Donald Trump. Chinese companies and investors eyeing U.S. assets could face more roadblocks as a result, at a time when the Chinese government is also restricting the flow of capital out of China following a bonanza of Chinese overseas deals. There have been 87 announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese firms so far in 2017, the highest on record and up from 77 deals in the corresponding period in 2016. CFIUS's more conservative stance towards deals coincides with growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. On Wednesday the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Since the start of the year, CFIUS has sent letters to companies involved in at least nine deals to say they would be blocked based on measures they have proposed to address potential national security risks, the people familiar said. Many of these deals are in the technology sector, the sources said. A rise in cyber security threats and rapid advances in technology makes it more difficult to establish whether a deal poses any threat, lawyers who represent companies before CFIUS said. An initial objection by the watchdog does not necessarily kill the deal immediately. Some companies this year have chosen to keep their CFIUS filings alive by proposing new mitigation measures, while others have pulled their applications and canceled their deals, the people said. They asked not be identified because interactions between CFIUS and the companies are confidential. ""CFIUS decisions are highly sensitive and we are not going to comment on rumors of their outcome,"" a White House spokeswoman said. A spokesman at the Treasury Department declined to comment. Treasury leads CFIUS with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin serving as chairman. Most of the deals that CFIUS has sought to block this year have not been announced. Among the companies that have disclosed they have withdrawn their CFIUS applications and canceled their deals are U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp, which tried to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, and Texas oil producer ExL Petroleum Management LLC, which sought to sell its assets to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Energy. By comparison, in the entirety of 2014, the last year for which CFIUS has released official data, nine deals were withdrawn after CFIUS began an investigation. Several more companies face protracted CFIUS reviews amid delays after Trump took office in filling important mid-level political positions at several of the 16 government departments and agencies that comprise CFIUS. CFIUS is on track to review a record-setting 250 to 300 transactions in 2017, according to Anne Salladin, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP - up sharply from 147 deals in 2014. The backlog is leading many companies that fail to gain CFIUS clearance within the standard 75 days allocated for review to refile their applications. Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. A number of companies have said in regulatory filings that their high-profile deals are before CFIUS. They include Chinese payments company Ant Financial's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International and China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners' $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor. In addition, investment firm China Oceanwide Holdings Group's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra are also with the watchdog. Ant Financial has refiled its MoneyGram deal with CFIUS once, while Canyon Bridge and China Oceanwide have refiled their deals twice, according to company disclosures and Reuters reports. Unic is still on its first filing with CFIUS on its Xcerra deal, company disclosures and Reuters reports showed. Of the two dozen political appointee positions in the Treasury Department just three have been confirmed by U.S. lawmakers. A key CFIUS nomination is that of former Allen & Overy LLP lawyer Heath Tarbert, who has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, and has yet to be confirmed. The U.S. is not alone in concerns about foreign dealmaking: Germany, for one, raised the bar on criteria for overseas acquirers seeking to snap up domestic targets in tech-heavy industries.

""I promise you that,"" Pence told the crowd. More than 200 retail representatives from across the country, including small-business retailers, national executives and state officials, attended the Retail Advocates Summit in Washington, D.C. This year's convention focused on the importance of tax reform for retailers and their employees. ""As retail goes, so goes America,"" Pence said. ""This president is going to work with this Congress, this year, and pass the largest tax cuts since the days of Ronald Reagan."" The current tax code creates ""huge barriers"" to creating more retail jobs, he added. ""The internal revenue code is [currently] two times as long as the Bible, with no good news,"" he joked. The GOP has promised to simplify the tax code, making the language ""fairer"" and ""simpler."" On Tuesday, Pence took the opportunity to speak about Trump's latest efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. He opened the event by detailing Republicans' latest push in health care — probably not the conversation many retailers were expecting to have. Lately, Republicans have been facing heated pressure from big businesses, including retailers, to move on from health-care legislation to passing some sort of tax reform. Many executives have stressed the importance of securing a major reduction in the corporate tax rate, which currently stands at 35 percent. On Tuesday, Pence suggested to the retailers a cut to 15 percent. Though both White House and Republican leaders have proposed steep cuts, analysts say divisions within the GOP and the stalemate on health care have diminished the prospect of aggressive action. Retail executives in particular remain concerned about one of House Speaker Paul Ryan's proposals: a border adjustment tax, also referred to as BAT. But Pence didn't mention BAT — a definite elephant in the room — during his Tuesday speech. The consumer-facing industry has been leading the fight against the proposed measure, which would tax imports into the United States. In May, for example, a group of retail CEOs met with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to express frustration regarding the import tax, with many arguing this plan would cause companies to hike prices and pass the burden on to consumers. Present at the May meeting were executives from Coca-Cola, Dollar General and J.C. Penney. The estate tax, however, did come under fire. ""[U]nder President Trump we will repeal the death tax once and for all,"" Pence said, to a heavy round of applause. This is important to retailers because some closely held businesses are subject to the estate tax. ""Less regulation, lower taxes, better infrastructure,"" he said. The president wants retailers to be able to compete on a ""level playing field"" with companies all across the world, he said.

Things are farther ahead in Canada. Regulations for production and sales have been in place for over three years, and the federal government has introduced a timeline to full federal legalisation for lifestyle use in July 2018. Capacity in Canada for lifestyle alone is projected to reach ""5 billion dollars per year to start,"" according to a recent report from Deloitte. Yet, while many investors focus on opportunities stemming from Canada's upcoming legalization – plus the longer-term investment potential in what will likely be a growing number of American states – they are missing the global shift in cannabis towards Western Europe. That's where the action is really heating up. The population of the United States is approximately 325 million. There are 35 million living in Canada. But compare that to the European Union's population of 510 million. Germany, with more than 80 million people alone, legalized medicinal cannabis in January of this year. Add that to Italy's nascent existing medicinal cannabis program. These European markets are increasingly important to the cannabis sector. Each has a well-funded medical system, residents who seek natural and complementary therapies, and a government-supported mandate to stop the rising tide of opiate addiction related to chronic pain treatment. Taken together, these and other European examples show that we're seeing traditionally conservative attitudes shift as medicinal cannabis is legalized. That also means investors in cannabis who focus solely on North America are missing the huge potential found across the Atlantic. Those investors restricting their cannabis investments to this side of the ocean – and in the United States in particular – are left navigating an array of legislation on a state-by-state basis, prohibitive out-of-state investment regulations, and a prohibitive tax code. These investors miss the boat as they churn through such choppy water. In Germany, cannabis will be produced by licenced producers and distributed to pharmacies like any other medication, with each prescription eligible for full reimbursement from health insurance. In their patient-driven markets, Germans, Italians and other Europeans are demanding the alternative of cannabis over opiates. In our view, people who think opiates are the only answer to pain relief have a similar mis-perception as people who still think medicinal cannabis is nothing more than smoking up with their doctor's permission. They are both wrong. In short, medical cannabis is about personalized and effective medicine. It's not about getting high. The Europeans know that, as we do in North America. As Germany moves smartly down this path of medicinal cannabis, the rest of Europe will soon follow. And to ignore 500 million people in a stable economy is a mistake. We're at the start of the global revolution. We all need to be looking to Europe next. ",Medical marijuana is really taking off in Europe-commentary,0.8519
375,Rachel Cao,7202017,CNBC,7132017,"If you're looking for affordable health care, consider seeking medical attention outside the U.S. As costs continue to climb, retirees increasingly are looking abroad for less costly coverage. Below are the five best countries in which to find affordable health care, according to InternationalLiving.com. Just as in the U.S., metropolitan areas in these countries will typically provide better quality of care than rural ones, says International Living senior editor and author Dan Prescher, and often matches or beats care in the U.S. Large clinics and hospitals in Panama are often affiliated with U.S. counterparts such as the Cleveland Clinic and John Hopkins Medicine International. While most expats tend to pay out-of-pocket, International Living says it's best to still have private insurance. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Panama offers coverage for as little as $80 per month for those under age 65. Older expats or those with pre-existing conditions may opt for a hospital membership that costs anywhere between $90 and $175 per month, according to International Living. Unlike many insurance plans, some hospitals may offer limited coverage for pre-existing conditions after a waiting period of one or two years. Mexico is known for providing health care at a fraction of U.S. costs. Expats can expect to pay half or less for medical expenses and prescription drugs. Legal Mexican residents have access to two health care systems: government-run public health or private. The government-run systems offers basic care with costs running as low as a few hundred dollars per year. Many expats also use private health care where you can pay with cash or use insurance. A standard visit to the doctor can run $30 to $40. The World Health Organization ranks Colombia's health-care system 22nd worldwide, which is higher than both Canada (ranked 30th) and the U.S. (ranked 37th). Anyone under age 60 with a national ID card, even those with pre-existing conditions, can apply for government health insurance. Co-pays average $3. Many ex-pat retirees pay a premium of $70 to $85 for a couple, according to International Living. Private health insurance can also be added. Premiums vary yet are still are significantly lower than what a couple would pay in the U.S. There are two medical systems in Costa Rica: a government-run one and the private medical system, with most people choosing to combine both. Caja is Costa Rica's universal health care system, which is available for both citizens and legal residents. As a Caja user, you pay an income-based monthly fee that covers the applicant and a dependent spouse. The fee is about $75 to $150, according to International Living, and provides complete coverage, including doctor and specialist visits, diagnostic testing and prescriptions. However, a major drawback is long waiting times for specialized surgeries, since Caja covers a majority of the population. The private medical system is another option. A doctor's visit there is $50, ultrasounds run $75 and major surgeries are usually half to a quarter of costs in the U.S., according to International Living. Malaysia's most popular areas of treatment are cosmetic surgery, dental work and dermatology, attracting 1 million medical tourists worldwide in 2016, according to International Living. George Town and Kuala Lumpur are the main medical centers. Most Malaysian doctors were trained in the U.S., Australia or the U.K., and all are English-speaking, a major perk for ex-pats. Malaysia has about 11 hospitals with Joint Commission International (JCI) certification, considered the gold standard for health-care providers worldwide.

Healthcare is front and center in Washington once more, and lawmakers have made little progress toward making anticipated changes on the insurance front. In the absence of more reform efforts, health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) continues to walk its own path, making key strategic decisions intended to support the insurer's profitability while still retaining its customer base. Coming into Tuesday's second-quarter financial report, UnitedHealth investors were optimistic that the insurance company's efforts would pay off with broad growth in sales and earnings. The company's results largely bore those expectations out, and UnitedHealth again boosted its 2017 profit guidance to reflect the success it has had. Let's look more closely at UnitedHealth and what its results mean for investors going forward. Image source: UnitedHealth. UnitedHealth's second-quarter results continued its string of solid performance. Revenue of $50.05 billion was up 7.7% from year-ago levels, almost exactly matching the consensus forecast among investors. Net income soared by a third to $2.35 billion, and even after allowing for extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $2.46 per share topped what those following the stock had expected to see by $0.08 per share. Looking more closely at how UnitedHealth did, the company's two main segments had more balanced contributions to its growth. The UnitedHealthcare insurance division revenue climbed almost 9% to $40.8 billion, as strength in its Medicare and retirement, community and state, and global segments offset a slight revenue decline from employer and individual plans. UnitedHealth served 195,000 more people during the quarter than it did three months ago, as new awards in several states offset seasonal workforce reductions with some of the insurer's private-employer customers. Margin improvement helped boost operating earnings to $2.2 billion. UnitedHealth's Optum health services unit also showed signs of renewed growth. Revenue climbed almost 10%, with particularly strong results for the OptumHealth health-plan management business and the OptumInsight revenue management and business process business. The OptumRx pharmacy benefit management service still lagged somewhat, but it managed to post a 5% rise in segment sales. UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley was pleased with the performance of the company. ""Continued strong revenue growth from new business and exceptional customer retention reflects the confidence customers place in our commitment to and effectiveness in meeting their healthcare needs,"" Hemsley said. Investors will be curious to see whether UnitedHealth can keep up its streak of favorable claims performance. During the second quarter, the company said that medical reserves development added $200 million to performance, compared to a $100 million headwind in the year-ago quarter. Improved business mix and product performance also helped offset the impact of tax deferral issues. With a medical care ratio of 82.2%, UnitedHealth remains healthy. UnitedHealth again boosted its projections for the full year. The health insurer didn't change its revenue guidance from its previous level of around $200 billion mark, but adjusted earnings are now projected to come in between $9.75 and $9.90 per share. That's a rise of $0.05 to $0.10 per share from the previous quarter's guidance, and that shows that UnitedHealth isn't concerned about the potential impact of healthcare reform efforts on its bottom line. Going forward, it will be interesting to see how UnitedHealth responds if changes to the Affordable Care Act take place. The company has slashed its coverage under the ACA in 2017, retreating to only three states compared to its 34-state network in 2016. If reform makes it more profitable for insurance companies to maintain plans under a federal framework, then UnitedHealth might return to the market, and that could actually make the area a growth driver again. UnitedHealth shareholders were reasonably happy with the company's performance, and the stock rose slightly in pre-market trading following the announcement. Investors will have to deal with uncertainty in the health insurance field for a while, but they can expect UnitedHealth to keep pressing forward and making the most of whatever opportunities it can capitalize on in the future.

Most Americans get their healthcare through a managed care organization, but nearly no one truly knows the ins and outs of the health insurance program they have. Managed care organizations are plans that insurance companies set up as a framework for healthcare benefits, and the idea behind managed care is to drive behavior that minimizes costs for benefits providers while also giving plan participants financial incentives to control their healthcare expenses. As a healthcare consumer, you'll likely have to deal with a managed care organization as a participant. As an investor, you can profit from the efforts that insurers take to make their managed care organizations as financially efficient and lucrative as possible. Managed Care Plan Insurer Market Capitalization 5-Year Average Annual Return UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) $179 billion 29.8% Humana (NYSE:HUM) $34 billion 27.6% Centene (NYSE:CNC) $14 billion 36.4% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. There are several types of managed care organizations, including the following: In addition, fee-for-service plans are a different type of health insurance coverage that doesn't use managed care practices. Instead, the plan simply reimburses all or a portion of medical costs for services provided, irrespective of the professional providing the services. Image source: Getty Images. Health maintenance organizations were initially created in the early 1970s. The key attribute of the HMO is the primary care physician, a single medical professional who has primary responsibility over the patient's care. The primary care physician is typically a general practitioner who can provide initial diagnoses of a wide range of problems, but for patients, the defining characteristic is that if specialty medical services are required, then the primary care physician must refer the patient to a specific specialist. Similarly, except in emergency situations, admissions to hospitals and other medical services may need pre-authorization from the primary care physician. If you don't follow the HMO rules, then your insurance can deny coverage or give you less comprehensive benefits. HMO users must also typically visit in-network medical professionals if they want coverage for services. Preferred provider organizations are groups of medical professionals, healthcare institutions, and other providers of healthcare services who gather together into a common network. A PPO doesn't absolutely require that a patient use medical professionals within the network in order to get benefits, but it reserves the best benefits for those who stay in-network. Because of the greater flexibility of PPOs compared to HMOs, premiums on PPOs are often a bit higher, but some patients prefer them because of the right to keep their own doctor as long as they're willing potentially to pay an out-of-network surcharge. Point-of-service plans incorporate different aspects of other managed care organizations. You'll typically choose a primary care physician from within a network of professionals, and in-network referrals are made easier than going beyond the network. Patients are also financially rewarded for staying in network by getting reduced rates, although, again, coverage for out-of-network professionals isn't completely unavailable as it might be for an HMO. Independent practice associations are groups of physicians that make contracts with managed care organizations like HMOs, PPOs, or point-of-service plans to provide healthcare services. IPAs have been the medical profession's response to certain health insurance innovations, allowing doctors and other healthcare professionals to organize on their own and determine their own frameworks for working together to treat patients. As a patient, choosing the right managed care organization can result in savings on healthcare costs. The most important thing to remember is that lower premiums don't always mean lower costs. HMOs often have the lowest premiums, but if you expect to run afoul of their provisions, their inflexibility can lead to lack of coverage for certain costly items. In those cases, the higher premiums that more flexible plan options charge can still be worth it if the coverage you get is more comprehensive. As an investor, the question to ask from a health insurance provider is whether their managed care organizations are effective in controlling costs and maximizing profit. The more that a company can convince its members to take advantage of options that save costs both for members and insurers alike, the better the overall relationship will be. UnitedHealth, Humana, and Centene all have expertise in handling managed care organization frameworks, and they've been quite successful in driving long-term returns for shareholders. UNH Total Return Price data by YCharts. Managed care organizations can be tough to navigate as a user, but they have become part of the healthcare system as we know it. By understanding managed care organizations more fully, you'll be able to make a better informed choice with your own healthcare and potentially invest more successfully in the space as well.

The standard eligibility age for Medicare in the United States is 65. However, many people don't know if they need to sign up for Medicare if they already have other health insurance coverage, such as through a job, a spouse's employer, from their former employer, or through COBRA. Here's a quick guide that can help you determine if you need to sign up for Medicare when you turn 65 or if you can wait longer without paying a penalty. When you have more than one insurance provider, there are certain rules that determine who pays what it owes first and who pays based on the remaining balance. For seniors who don't have other insurance, Medicare is obviously the primary payer. However, when you have other insurance, it's a little more complicated. Image source: Getty Images. Depending on the type of insurance you have (group coverage, retiree coverage, COBRA, marketplace coverage, etc.), Medicare can either be the primary or the secondary payer. If Medicare would be a secondary payer to your current insurance, you can delay signing up for Medicare Part B. If your current insurance would become a secondary payer to Medicare, you should sign up during your initial enrollment period, which is the seven-month period that begins three months prior to the month you'll turn 65. It's also worth noting that although I'm specifically mentioning Medicare Part B, which is medical insurance, this applies to Part A (hospital insurance) as well. However, Medicare Part A is free to the vast majority of Americans, so it's probably worth signing up for Part A whether you're required to or not. On the other hand, Medicare Part B has a monthly premium you'll have to pay ($134 per month for most new beneficiaries in 2018), which is why it can make sense to delay signing up if it's not going to be your primary insurance. If you aren't sure if your employer meets the ""group health coverage"" criteria, ask your employer's benefits manager. It's also important to note that regardless of whether you're still working or not, if you've already signed up for Social Security benefits, you'll be automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when you turn 65. If you don't want to keep Part B, you'll need to cancel it (instructions are on the Medicare card you'll receive). This leaves a fairly long list of other types of insurance that become secondary payers to Medicare. Therefore, if you're turning 65 and any of these situations apply to you, you should sign up for Medicare during your initial enrollment period. If one of these situations applies to you and you don't sign up for Medicare Part B during your initial enrollment period, you could face permanently higher premiums when you do. ","

Below, three Fools lay out the case for investing in WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:DLN), Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHZ), and Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEMKT:VHT), three low-cost index funds that are fit for investors who want to stay invested for the long haul. This fund has a dividend-focused strategy that reduces risk by offering broad exposure to large-cap U.S. dividend-paying stocks. It even takes a slight contrarian and value approach, increasing its holdings in stocks when they become cheaper relative to their dividends and their peer group. Some of the fund's largest holdings include juggernaut names such as Apple Inc., Microsoft, and AT&T, but the fund is so diverse that those three holdings combine to make up barely 10% of total assets. WisdomTree's fund has a trailing 12-month dividend yield of 2.54%, which is well above the S&P 500 average yield of about 1.91%. Further, its expense ratio of 0.28% and low turnover of 11% make it a cheap and competitive option among similar funds. If you're looking for a safe fund offering a combination of income and upside, WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend ETF is a great way to keep you in the investing game. These three index funds offer compelling returns and attractive expense ratios for long-term investors. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF): When it comes to retirement, it's time to start taking some risk off the table. The Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF allows you to diversify your portfolio with more bond exposure (reducing risk) while slashing the expenses you pay: Its expense ratio is a next-to-nothing 0.04%. The Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF allows you to have your cake and eat it too. The fund's underlying bond investments have an average yield to maturity of 2.6% from a super-safe portfolio of investment-grade bonds, roughly half of which are government or government-backed issues. It remains the lowest-cost way to add high-quality bond exposure to your portfolio. Jason Hall (Vanguard Health Care ETF): While politicians argue about how to drive down healthcare spending and costs -- a serious issue in the United States -- there is an inexorable trend happening around the world: Billions of people are growing older, and this aging population will drive a significant amount of healthcare spending over the next several decades. This is especially true as life expectancies increase in both developed and developing economies. Furthermore, we're entering a golden age of healthcare, with personalized medicine set to significantly improve patient outcomes across a swath of illnesses and potentially increase life expectancies even more. There are already diseases being cured that only a few years ago were the equivalent of a death sentence. The best part for investors is these major advances in treatment and care are only just getting started. Since most of us don't have the knowledge or expertise to pick the healthcare companies that will be the biggest winners, the Vanguard Health Care ETF is an excellent way to gain exposure to the potential. This ETF tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index. It has beaten the S&P 500 handily since inception, and it only carries a 0.10% expense ratio (that's $1 per year per $1,000 invested). Looking ahead, I think the prospects are great that this index fund will continue to outperform the market for many years to come.

The best way to invest is to find great businesses, and then buy and hold their stocks for a long time -- maybe even forever. That holds true in healthcare as well as in any other part of the market. But because of healthcare's complexity and the risks attached to pharmaceutical stocks and biotechs, many struggle to invest in this huge growth sector. The good news is, you don't have to buy risky biotechs to invest in healthcare. In fact, you can buy big, well-diversified companies with much simpler business models, including estate investment trusts (REITs). Welltower (NYSE:WELL) is one such REIT. It owns buildings that healthcare businesses lease. Let's talk through the top 10 reasons, then, to buy Welltower stock and hold it forever. Demographics favor companies like Welltower. Image source: Getty Images. As the population ages, healthcare spending is likely to ramp up significantly. It's already a $3 trillion industry in the U.S., and if you pay attention to the news, you've probably been hearing plenty of ideas for reducing costs. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, care in hospitals -- which provide some of the most expensive care in our healthcare system -- accounted for 32% of healthcare spending in 2015. Welltower is investing in lower-cost post-acute care and senior housing, because care is likely to shift away from hospitals over the long term as our system struggles to contain costs. Welltower's dividend currently yields 5%. As a REIT, it's required to pay out 90% of otherwise taxable income out as dividends. That means a juicy dividend for income investors. Management has paid 184 consecutive dividends. And the dividend is well covered by funds from operations (FFO, a REIT metric similar to earnings per share, with depreciation and amortization added back in), with a 73% payout ratio based on trailing-12-month FFO, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence. Many companies catering to senior healthcare are heavily reliant on government healthcare payers, whether Medicare or Medicaid. This situation creates reimbursement risk, as the government regularly uses its size to demand lower prices for services. Ninety-three percent of Welltower's portfolio NOI, however, comes from private pay sources, which shields it nicely from this common risk. In Q1 2017, Welltower reported that its same-store NOI increased by 2.1% year over year. That highlights Welltower's ability to control costs and raise rent over time, enabling the company to improve its return on each asset in its portfolio. Welltower owns 1,375 properties, with 70% of its in-place NOI coming from senior housing, 17% outpatient medical, and 13% post-acute or long-term care. Welltower operates primarily in the United States (which represents 81% of total revenue) but has a presence in both the U.K. and Canada. While Welltower operates across the United States, its portfolio is concentrated in urban markets with high barriers to entry. That helps it maintain pricing power and maintain high occupancy, which is why its medical outpatient occupancy is 95%, compared with its peers' average of 91%. Welltower is good at buying up buildings. It then leases them to partners such as Genesis Healthcare, Sunrise Senior Living (owned by Healthcare REIT), and Brookdale Senior Living. That means Welltower can stick to its core areas of expertise while enabling others to save on the substantial up-front cost of owning their buildings. Even better: No single operating partner represents more than 14% of Welltower's NOI from continuing operations. That helps Welltower spread out the risk tied to any operator's potential bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve has held interest rates low since the Great Recession, which makes borrowing cheap. That's great for REITs, which generate returns by raising capital -- usually debt -- to buy properties, leasing out those properties, and pocketing the spread between those two numbers. With the Federal Reserve gradually raising rates, REITs will have more difficulty growing. This is particularly true for REITs with lots of variable-rate debt, as they'll see their interest rates increase, making that debt increasingly burdensome for those carrying it. However, less than 20% of Welltower's $10.5 billion in debt is variable-rate, which should help shield it from some of the immediate effects of the interest-rate increases. REITs tend to grow by acquisition, and Welltower has plenty of room to do just that. Management estimates that REITs own roughly 10% of outpatient square footage, with health systems owning the vast majority of the rest. As hospitals seek to free up cash to upgrade their technology footprints or acquire other hospitals, selling their outpatient centers and then leasing them back could look increasingly attractive. But even if that scenario didn't pan out, the underlying point remains: Welltower has plenty of room to expand into a footprint several multiples of its current size if management can continue sourcing attractive deals. All businesses have their weaknesses. For example, all REITs – Welltower included -- will suffer some ill effects as the Fed raises interest rates. But with the combination of attractive factors we've discussed here, I think many investors -- particularly risk-averse income investors looking for a strong dividend and a business model not dependent on a single drug -- would do well to give Welltower a second look. And then a third. ","

In 2010, President Obama selected Beth to be a member of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability, where she created MoneyAsYouGrow.org, which has since been adopted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Buck Hartzell recently sat down with Beth at Fool HQ to find out more about the importance of educating children about money, saving, and more. A full transcript follows the video. Buck Hartzell: Thank you, all, for coming! Welcome, Beth, to The Motley Fool! I'll give you a quick introduction, and then we'll get into some questions, and we'll help all of us that have kids in the audience make your kids money geniuses, I think that's a desire that we all share. Beth Kobliner: Even if you're not. Hartzell: Yeah. And that's great. When I look at some of the folks that come here to The Motley Fool for help with their finances, they have degrees, sometimes graduate degrees in certain topics, but they don't have a basic understanding of a lot of things that you mentioned in your book, whether it's a Roth IRA or a 401(k) or how much they should contribute. So, the question is, where did you learn about money? Was that something that you learned in school? Or did it come from somewhere else? Kobliner: I definitely didn't learn it in school. I grew up middle class in Queens. My dad was a teacher and then a principal, and my mom was a chemistry teacher, but by the time I was born, a stay-at-home mom. My parents scrimped and saved to have enough money to send us to college. In fact, I was saying this before, I found a spreadsheet that my dad made in 1981, and my parents said, ""You can either get into Brown,"" or a few other schools that I didn't get into, ""Or you can go to Queens College,"" which was our neighborhood school that was basically free, because they felt like it was worth the scrimping and saving. He made a whole spreadsheet on what I would have to contribute, $2,000 a year, which adjusted for inflation was about $10,000 today. So, I think that, observing my parents, they're both Depression generation babies, they were both born in 1929, and my mom would only shop on triple coupon day and she would buy in bulk, and we had 20 cans of tuna fish in our basement because she would always buy when it was a big sale, if you buy a lot you save more money. So, they were really careful about money, but I never felt a lack of much. When I think that, except for once where I wanted a Lacoste Izod alligator shirt -- I never got one, and now I don't want one -- but other than that, I think, kids learn by osmosis, and I don't think you need to be a money genius to teach a kid to be smart about money. But I think, if you love to spend, or that's what you value, those messages come across a little to kids. Hartzell: And you mentioned your parents. Harold is mentioned in there, Shirley is mentioned throughout the book. There were some great stories in there. One involved a candy shop. Do you mind sharing a little bit about that story? Kobliner: Thank you. My dad is Harold, my mom is Shirley. Didn't make up those names, that's their names. My dad was born in 1929, and his father was an alcoholic. I don't think you called it that back then, but he didn't work throughout the whole Depression, and his mom was a seamstress. They had four kids. His brother, when he was born, slept in a drawer because they couldn't afford a crib. They were very poor. And my dad decided when he was 10 that he needed a job. So what he did was he sat in a candy store, the local candy store. He lived in this tenement. And every time the phone would ring in the candy store, the public pay phone, my dad would pick up the phone and run out to the tenement, because nobody had phones in those days, he would say, ""Mrs. Jones, phone call!"" And Mrs. Jones would come downstairs, he tells the story like, she had curlers in her hair and she would come down, and he would get a tip. He would get a nickel or a dime for telling her that there was a phone call. And he was sitting in a candy store doing this, and he used to say to my kids when they were little, ""Do you think I bought candy?"" And they were like, ""Yeah!"" And he said, ""No. I saved that money, I never bought candy, and I gave it to my parents,"" because they were always fighting about money and he thought maybe if he could give them a little more money, give them a little bit, that it would make a difference. And that, to me, is the epitome of that delayed gratification, and that ability to be able to say, ""I'm not going to spend it now, I'm going to think toward the future."" And I do think that the Depression generation had that, and I would argue Millennials, who are always bashed, with avocado toast or whatever, I actually think the Millennials I've been talking to also have a bit more of trying to get a bargain and not getting into credit card debt, that similar kind of mentality. Hartzell: Boomers not so much. Kobliner: Boomers and Gen X-ers, forget it. [laughs] Hartzell: [laughs] You mentioned delayed gratification, which appears throughout the book. An important topic. Carol Dweck talked about the effort effect, which I think aligns pretty well with that, and the marshmallow test, of course, which you talk about. Can you give us an example? How do you get kids, and I think, in a world where there's cellphones in almost everyone's hands, you have social media, you have video games, you have fidget spinners, I saw Tom over there with his fidget spinner, how do you get somebody to delay gratification? Kobliner: Tom, are you going to take that question? [laughs] I think that there are different ways. You could talk to your kids about, ""One day, we as a family are going to go to Disneyworld or Europe and we're going to have to save for that. And we have three or four years before we can go, and if we save this amount, we're not going to eat out as much,"" having concrete goals and examples, I think, is a wonderful way to make it clear, to start putting that message in kids' minds. Also, some kids who really like math, you can go to investor.gov, and if you plug in different interest rates and you save 20 years or 40 years, it's so fun to look at that number. ""If I start at 16 and I save every year for four years with my summer earnings of $1,000, I'll have $100,000 by the time I'm 65."" Or, if you save $1 a day starting at age 10, and you do that to age 65 and earn 7%, you'll have $200,000. Just, numbers like that can motivate, and anecdotes. I learned from my parents, my mom would say, ""If you want to teach your kids a message, tell them a story."" I was like, ""What if I don't have a story?"" She said, ""Make it up."" But, telling kids, ""Our old neighbor, he didn't have a lot of money, but he saved $100 a month, because he always wanted a boat. And he was able to save up that money."" That kind of concrete goal I think is really critical, and gets the message across to kids. You have to say it a million times. Just like vegetables, they have to try it eight times before they like it. You could probably say it 800 times. Hartzell: I like the idea of having something fun, and a way to celebrate your savings, too. I think one of the things that some folks here, Robert Brokamp, some folks at The Fool talked about having different savings jars or buckets for different things. One of them could be college, and that's a longer-term goal, and there's another shorter-term goal, it could be, ""I want to buy a new football,"" or, ""I want to celebrate by buying something that I really like."" And that's the way, I think, maybe, to get people delaying buying something today with buying something even nicer a little bit down the line. So, work ethic is a topic that comes up a lot. Certainly with your parents, Depression-era, and being around there, is an important thing. I'll ask this question, and I'll share an anecdote with somebody here. One of the Hartzell kids' favorite thing to do is, when we get snow around here, which isn't very often, they've realized that's actually money laying around on the sidewalk -- Kobliner: I made so much money shoveling snow. Hartzell: Yeah! And there are a lot of people in our neighborhood that are old or don't want to shovel their own snow, so as soon as the snow hits they're out early, the crack of dawn, and shoveling snow in driveways. And one of their friends happened to be over and found out about this, and they were like -- Kobliner: Uh oh, competition. Hartzell: ""This is great, there's money out there waiting to be shoveled up."" Kobliner: Literally. Hartzell: So, they went out and knocked on door around their neighborhood, and one gentleman in the house came out and was so amazed, he said, ""I've been waiting,"" he happens to own a business, owns a company, and he said, ""I've been waiting for 10 years for some kid in our neighborhood to come around and ask me if he wants to shovel my snow. So, I'm going to pay you to shovel the driveway, and here's a $100 tip."" And they were like, oh my gosh! This was unbelievable for them. So, the question for you is about work ethic. Are we making kids lazy today? Are we enabling them to be lazy? Or is that just my impression, that kids are different today than they were maybe a long time ago? Kobliner: I love that story. That's a great story. I made a bundle. I remember so clearly. It was like, $5. They would ask how much do you charge, and we're like, ""Well, whatever you think,"" and that was a mistake because people would say, ""Oh, $2,"" and we were sweating. But, I think that today, take high school. If you look at the statistics, it's not that kids necessarily have that much more homework, at least according to the research I've looked at, although I think my kids have so much more homework than I did back in high school. But the pressures to do well, to take SAT prep courses, to take SAT II prep courses, all these things that didn't exist. When I was working, I had four jobs in high school, I worked at a diner, I worked at a grocery store, I worked at a pharmacy, and I think that there are more pressures and there are more demands on kids' time, the idea that you need to be on a team, all these resume-building items. And, also, we know, in some ways, it makes logical sense, because research shows that if a kid works over 10 to 15 hours a week in high school, kids who work more than that are likely to not graduate from high school, they're more likely to not graduate -- in other words, it's OK to work around 10 to 15 hours a week, but once you pass that mark, that's a dangerous sign, if your kid is working much more than that, because they're not spending enough time on their school work. But I do think working over the summer, the internship versus paying summer camp job that your kids are doing -- I think it's smart what you're doing because you're starting younger. And I think when kids are in middle school and high school, having those summer jobs, it is important. But the year or two before high school, I don't know what you would do, if your kid either had an internship working in a lab with a scientist or whatever, versus working bagging groceries. As a parent, it's a tricky equation to figure out. Hartzell: Yeah, it's definitely a balance, for sure. I know we're getting ready to go on a family vacation here in a couple of days to Europe, and our kid missed out on an internship that he got for going, because we're going to be away. Kobliner: Can I come? [laughs] Hartzell: But, you have to balance some of those things out. On investing, and you've talked about mutual funds and indexing and keeping your costs low, we totally agree with that and love that idea. You didn't seem as enamored with owning individual stocks for children, so I wanted to talk a little bit about that. My kids own stocks, they have their own portfolio, and I think it's fun to follow individual companies. You learn a lot of lessons around those. What are your thoughts on owning individual stocks versus an index fund or an ETF or something like that? Hartzell: Yeah. And low expense ratio, as you mentioned. You get exposure right away off the bat to all those 500 companies. Kobliner: Right, diversification, exactly. Hartzell: We also like the idea, and I think a fun thing to do, sometimes, for kids, when they own some stock, is go to an annual meeting and make that an event and have it fun. Kobliner: Isn't he a fun dad? [laughs] Hey, kids! Hartzell: Usually those annual meetings are on weekdays and you get out of school, so that's a bonus right there. And some of them actually serve chocolate covered strawberries and things afterwards, so there's some rewards in there. So, let's talk a little bit more here about, how can we make money just fun? I think that's one of the things, my oldest son is 16, he's taking a course online on personal finance, he doesn't exactly enjoy it. This is the same person who goes to an annual meeting. He'll tell you everything about Apple, he knows everything about them. But it's just not that fun. How do you put the fun back in finance, how can we do that? Hartzell: Thank you. Kobliner: He's 87. But, that idea of, this is something that's important. And there's no question your kids are going to grow up and say, ""This is something that's important. Lord knows he pretended to like all those annual meetings."" [laughs] To make dad happy. But that's setting the tone for what you think is important as a parent, and that does so much, it goes such a long way. Hartzell: Speaking of not real. College is one of the most expensive things most people will buy. To a lot of them, it doesn't seem like a real expense, a lot of them will borrow an immense amount of money to go there. You talk positively about college, too, about how important it is to get an education for your future earnings potential. So, the question for you is, how much is college worth? An Ivy League school nowadays is probably north of $300,000 if you want to do four years of school. As good consumers, as frugal coupon clippers and everything else, what's the amount that somebody should be willing to pay when they're looking around at schools? What's the right amount? Kobliner: I think this is a huge issue, and more and more, hopefully, I don't think it'll happen in the next 3.5 to 4 years, but I think paying attention to the cost of college. One rule of thumb that I heard of from this guy Mark Kantrowitz, who's this guru on student loans, is, don't have your kid borrow more than the first year's income. If the kid makes $40,000, try not to have him or her borrow more than $40,000. Which is still a big chunk of money. The average right now is $37,000. The median -- it's hard to get the numbers exactly, which in itself is a crime, that we don't have really good statistics -- is $20,000 for kids graduating from college. And the reliance of private student loans, which is only going to get worse because the rules have already been loosened up, that private student loans are usually much higher interest rates than federal student loans, which are still about 4-4.25% right now. Private student loans can be double digits, 15-16%, and they're harder to pay back as well. And I think, we're getting to, I'll meet someone who says, ""I'm a philosophy major."" I mean was an English major at Brown, don't get me wrong. But I think there really was, back in the day, you could be a great writer and come out and get a job. Or start The Motley Fool. [laughs] What was your major? Tom Gardner: English. Kobliner: English! Woo! [laughs] Hartzell: I was sociology. Kobliner: Ah, there you go! But I think it's much more difficult now for kids, and grad school. So many young people are thinking, ""I'm going to grad school, they would be like $200,000 to get my PhD in philosophy."" And as much as that's brilliant, there are no jobs. Even if you come out of Harvard philosophy school, if there's such a thing, there's still one or two jobs in the whole country. So, you have to be much more pragmatic. It makes me so sad, I've met so many parents over the last year who say, ""We scrimped and saved because our kid got into this school, and we thought it was so great, but after the first year our kid was miserable, we forgot to include travel costs, and we're going to send them to the local public school and we realized we had three more kids down the line."" It's so expensive and so mystifying, the whole financial aid form. And I'm a little bit depressed by this because when I was on President Obama's Council, they really made an effort, and Arne Duncan, who's the education secretary, really tried to make the FAFSA form, the free financial aid form, a little simpler. And they really tried to take some steps. But, it's really hard for parents. Hartzell: And a lot of kids get in -- I paid a visit to my financial aid office where I went to undergraduate school and asked them a little bit about what they see coming through the office, what are the challenges and problems? And they were saying, it used to be that parents would come in and co-sign for these loans, but now they aren't, because although the parents earn in plenty to co-sign, they have a lot of debt, so they're not co-signing. And I think a lot of the students don't necessarily realize, these aren't loans you can walk away from. They're going to be with you a long time. Over $1 trillion in student debt now, I think being pragmatic probably makes sense. You have a great point that I love in the book. It's called your 10 investment rules. I'm not going to go through all 10 of those, but if you could just riff on a couple of those I'd be interested to hear them. One is, you don't need to be a perfect investor to be a good investor. What do you mean by that? Kobliner: I think it's something I've heard throughout my 30 years writing about personal finance. What? It's been 30 years doing this? I'd better be damn good at it. [laughs] But, I think it's that, if you have money in the market -- you need to have money in the stock market. And whether you feel like, ""I'm really good at this, picking stocks,"" just putting some money in the stock market, ideally it might be in an index fund, you will do better than not being in the market at all. And as the saying goes, perfection is the enemy of the good, people are like ""Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure, I'm not going to sign up for a 401(k) because I don't really know what investment to choose,"" that procrastination, life goes on and you miss out. So, I think just making sure you're in the stock market, and making a choice, and hopefully a low-cost one. We know, research shows, it's much better than staying out of it completely. Hartzell: We see that with a lot of new investors, that fear of failure. And I think of it like the person who has all straight A's never want to get a B, they never want to fail. And the reality is, in investing, if you're the best in the world, you're going to be wrong 40% of the time. It's OK. It's OK to buy a stock that goes down or doesn't work out, because of the successes you're going to have over the course of your lifetime are going to far outweigh some of those losses. So, that fear of failure is something we talk a lot about here at The Fool. Kobliner: At least, statistically speaking. We don't know, we can't promise for the future of stocks or the stock market. But we know, if we use past history, as a group of stocks, predictably, we think it will do better over the long time. I meet so many people who might get a financial, personal finance, in your 20s and 30s, and you meet people in their 40s and 50s, and now I met someone who was 60s, and they were like ""I read your book when I was younger."" I'm like, am I 112 years old? How does that math work? But people have said, they did put a little bit in. And I said, ""Put 10%, just put 10%, I know you can afford it, just do it."" And then they said, and I'm sure you get the same thing, ""I look back and I have hundreds of thousands of dollars that I wouldn't have otherwise."" And I think of it like, you drink three cups of coffee a day and you cut back to two, and the first week you have headaches and it's so hard, but after a while, it's OK. I think the same with money, you just force yourself, if you earn $20,000, $50,000, $200,000, you have to put 10% away. And your lifestyle, just live off the rest, the 90%, and your lifestyle adjusts, and you don't buy certain things, and it works out. And I think that mentality is just important. Hartzell: Another rule is, be lazy and trade less. Does it pay to be lazy? Hartzell: Yeah. And one of the dangers of the ETFs now, which proliferate all over the place is, you can buy and trade them like stocks, which is a double-edged sword for a lot of us, because we see people trading in and out of sectors and doing all those things that hurt them in stocks, but now they can do them in ETFs and they feel safer, but it's not necessarily safer because they're doing the same thing, you're churning them, you're paying commission. Kobliner: Not at all. You just buy the broad-based index, and you put maybe 20% of it internationally. I do think that money is one of those things that, you can be lazy. You can set it and forget it, putting whatever you can into your company 401(k) and making sure that over time that you put the maximum in, or putting money into an index fund. I think those are those set it and forget it things, and they're so beneficial for people. And it's counterintuitive. You think the smart people are actively trading. No, actually, they're doing worse. Hartzell: There's one point in this book that made me a little bit sad. I have a daughter, she's in the middle, 14 years old. You mentioned that parents or more open and more likely to talk to their boys about money and finance than they are to their daughters. And one of the things we see when I go out and talk to colleges, if you go to an investing club, it's probably 80-90% males. We see, not to that great of a degree, across our services. We certainly see more males that are interested in money. So, my question is, do we just not talk to the girls about money and finances? Or is it that we need to talk to them in a different way, maybe, than we talk to boys about money and finance? Hartzell: I have a couple more questions, and I want to do a short section on buy, sell, or hold, and then we'll take any questions from people in the audience. In your opinion, as an expert in this field, what's the most important thing that we can do as parents to teach our children? What's the most important thing? If you had to take one thing away, go home and do this with your kids, what would that be? Kobliner: I would say, no matter your child's age, teach them that credit card debt is a bad thing. I just heard that Warren Buffett says that, too. I wish he would stop copying me. It's, the notion that, if you have a credit card, and there's certainly less credit card debt, like I said, among young people, because they couldn't get credit cards in high school, the rules changed in 2009, you had to either have an income or be 21, or have a parent co-sign to get a credit card. Which is a mistake, never co-sign a credit card with your kid. But, I think, teaching a kid, do not spend more than you have in your savings, do not buy things you cannot afford, is a concept that people still don't get. And I think that's a lesson that I knew, by osmosis coming from parents who were Depression-generation, and my father said, he's 87 years, so, I don't know how long he's had a credit card, but he never paid a late payment, he always paid in full. I think, if you have a credit card that's charging 15%, paying it off is equivalent of earning 15% guaranteed on your money after taxes. And that's still basically the best. You can't get 15% guaranteed after taxes anywhere, except a 401(k) with matching, which is 100%. Hartzell: And stocks have only done about 9% over their history. Kobliner: Right. So, don't get into credit card debt. Teaching it to kids. Because, I think kids see it as magic. ""My parents swoosh this card and they get something."" And it's very confusing for kids, and that's debit cards, but I think credit is really such an insidious thing, credit cards can be so problematic for people down the line, that I would say, that would be it, if I had to take just one financial lesson. Hartzell: On the flip side, the mistakes. We all make mistakes as parents in different things. What's the biggest mistake that you see across parents that they need to eliminate in order to help their children be better with their finances? Kobliner: I think it's lying. [laughs] Whether you have a lot of money and you don't want to confront it because you don't want your kids to know how you feel, or you have very little money, so you might overcompensate, and think, ""I'm going to buy my kid that because I don't want them to miss out."" I think both of those are problems. You don't have to tell your kids everything. You don't have to tell them your income, who makes more, mommy or daddy. I don't think you have to tell them how much you have in your 401(k). There are a lot of questions you don't have to answer, and I have a list of them in my book. But I do think we have to try to be someone honest about the things we do answer. As simple as, you walk in a store, ""Can I have that?"" ""Oh, I don't have any money on me,"" and then you use your card and they see you using your card and they're like, ""Wait, you don't have money on you."" A woman I know told me a story where, just recently, she went out with her kids and forgot her credit card and she had cash and they went to the Gap and they went out to lunch and they said, ""Can we go to the movies, mom?"" And she said, ""I ran out of money."" And they were like, ""Does that mean we're homeless? What do you mean, we've run out of money."" They were little kids, they didn't get that concept of running out. Hartzell: That's great. We'll take your questions here. I have a quick round. We call it a buy, sell, or hold round here. I'll throw out the idea, and you'll let me know whether you going to buy, sell or hold. The first one is autonomous driving vehicles. Would you buy them, sell them, or hold them? In our near future. Kobliner: [laughs] I don't know! What's the expense ratio? Buck Hartzell: Google, Apple? Kobliner: Sure, I guess, it's a good thing to hold. Hartzell: OK, she's a hold on that one. Bitcoin, or other blockchain types of new currencies are you a buy, sell, or hold on these new currencies? Kobliner: I would only say buy because I think they've had such a bad time and they're probably down and probably eventually, maybe, so it's a value -- I don't know any of this. I don't know. Index funds. Ask me another one. Hartzell: OK, the last one. A degree at the University of Michigan for $250,000. Are you going to buy, sell, or hold the Wolverines? Kobliner: I would get a scholarship. My dad, I look back, he got a 0% interest rate loan from this thing called the Hebrew Loan Society. I don't even know what that is, but they gave a 0% interest rate loan for my college. He was a veteran, so he got a VA scholarship for me. I think getting creative and trying to really figure out how you can not get yourself or your kids into huge debt. I'm afraid of the parents who borrow for their kids' college, and the PLUS loan, the parent loan, which allows you to borrow as much as you can, as much as you need. It's really a problem. So, I don't know. I'm like a bad juror, I can't say guilty or not guilty unless I get to -- Hartzell: Well, I'm going to say that's a sell, because Andy Cross, our chief investment officer, went to Michigan, and Ron Gross's daughter, who sits right behind me, is going to Michigan. So I'm going to say it's a sell. Kobliner: It's a great school. Hartzell: No. My wife went to Ohio State, they're rivals. So, that's it for buy, sell or hold. Questions from anybody else in the audience about how to make your children money geniuses? Yes? Audience: You said one of the biggest influences is osmosis, kids watching what you're doing. But if the osmosis is of the wrong kind, how could I as another relative try to overcome that, especially when they live on the other side of the country? Hartzell: Let me ask that, in case they don't hear it. Sometimes kids don't have the right role models what if you're a relative, but not there with them all the time? How can you help out? What can you do to be a good role model from a distance? Kobliner: Right, that's a great question. And you're right, that's an inherent contradiction. You don't need to be a money genius to make your kid a money genius. But it sure is helpful if you're good at money and responsible, to make that. I think, whatever chance you get, talking to the kid. You can't bad mouth their parents, because that's a disaster. But you can say, ""I've been saving."" Again, anecdotes and stories. And saying, ""I'm going to set up a college plan for you,"" and the reason is, we know from research, and this is my favorite piece of research, that when you tell a child that you're saving for their college, they are seven times more likely to go to college, regardless of how much money is in that account. So whether you have $100 or $100,000, kids are more likely. It's the expectation, that you know someone believes in you and is saving for your college. And that's very powerful, and I know of a lot of philanthropic efforts that are starting with that, the notion that the kid knows someone is saving for them and they're more likely to go. And hopefully, they won't get into debt in the process. But, I think, using that, whether, these kids are not in college yet, and encouraging them to, you're going to match, for every $1 they put in, you'll put in $1 or $0.50. Maybe that does go back to making it fun. Having it more like a game. You put in a certain amount and I'll match it. And I think that can be very motivating to kids, without making it like, ""I think your parents are doing a lousy job."" Hartzell: Other questions. Tom? Gardner: We have Foley these two days, she's a 10 year old -- Kobliner: I met her already. She's a little intimidating, but she's very nice. Gardner: A soccer star. She's also somebody who saves what she earns. But, what about the child that saves too much, who maybe doesn't learn how to spend or what to spend on? [...] How do you encourage a child who's very thoughtfully saving, which is so rare, to also use that? Kobliner: To spend it. Hartzell: I should say, the question is, stop and smell the roses. Foley is a great example of somebody who's diligently saving all her money. How do we also enjoy it? Kobliner: OK, can I just ask whose kid is Foley? I met her during my interview, my podcast. Do you know what you're saving for, Foley? Or are you just saving? Good for you, that's awesome. Hopefully you'll hire me one day. [laughs] I'll come to you and you'll be like, ""No, I'm sorry."" I've gotten that question a lot. My husband was worried about our own kids. I would bring them to talks since they were little. My little one was like, ""Oh, I'm so worried!"" I was like, ""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know if I can afford health insurance, mommy, it's so expensive!"" when he was like six. It really was that level. So, in the end, that instinct to save money, at some point, breaks. I think some little kids love to just save. And I don't think that they have to spend when they're little, because instinct kicks in at one point, whether it's when they're in college or out of college. So, I don't worry about that. I look at all three of our kids, they were all voracious savers, and now, my oldest is 21 -- although, one thing that I think we did do well is, for college, we do pay for college for her, and she does work a very little bit in college, but, we've given her spending money, but it's a set amount, and we said, ""This is money."" And sometimes I'm very cynical about it, because I think, when I was a kid, I had four jobs, I worked at the Brown cafeteria, I worked in the Brown student agency doing dry cleaning and so on. And sometimes you have to step beyond yourself and say, ""My kids, we're going to give them some spending money, but that's it. We pay for your books, your college, your healthcare. If you want to take an Uber rather than the New York subway or walk to class, that comes from your money. If you want to go on a vacation with your friends who live in Australia,"" which she wanted to do, she figured out the cheapest flights. So, giving kids ownership of some money as they get older, I think, it makes them -- this is sort of the opposite of what you're asking, but it makes them more careful about spending. But, I've never met a 30 year old -- I mean, I guess there's a rare case of the hoarder who never spends money. But, I think life gets so tempting. Gardner: Why are we laughing in the front row? Audience: Because she's here. Hartzell: Next year is the year, Megan. Kobliner: I think it's great. I would embrace your hoarding tendencies. If you're saving, you have a chunk of money that, one day, there will be a reason. Do you own a home? Audience: No, not anymore. Kobliner: Not anymore. But you will one day. I just think that, having a huge amount of savings is never a bad thing. I was just on a show, I was on ABC or CBS this morning, and the woman said, the host, she was so cute, she took off her shoes and like, ""Look! $24, my shoes! And I got them 20% off!"" And I was like, ""Good for you!"" And she said, ""Do you know why my nail polish just chipped? Because I'm saving money!"" I'm like, ""Good for you!"" We save money, and there will be something that comes along, and you'll know when you want to buy it. I don't know, I have a bias toward saving. Hartzell: There'll be something you want, Foley. I trust you. It could be a shiny gold fidget spinner. Someday. OK, great. Thank you very much, Beth, for joining us. Kobliner: Thank you! These were great questions. Hartzell: And thank you all for coming today. ","

Investors and Wall Street analysts are watching UnitedHealth’s Optum health-care services arm, which they believe should drive growth for the company. “The key here is the long-term growth of Optum, OptumCare and our strong view that UNH is the leading agent of change in health care, driving the transformation from a broken system to a modern, effective and efficient patient-centered, value-based model of health care payment and delivery,” Skolnick said.

Related:  Health-care fund manager with 20% gain this year sees good times ahead as FDA becomes ‘more accommodating’ The contract poses a 0.5% to 1% upside to UnitedHealth’s 2018 consensus, Gupte said, and follows other contract wins, including General Electric and California public employees health insurance provider CalPERS. “Optum Rx’s solid track record of contract win supports our view that captive PBMs... will continue to win share from standalone PBMs and/or expand margins through re-contracting” Gupte said, reiterating an outperform rating on UnitedHealth with a $210 price target. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect UnitedHealth to report earnings of $2.38 per share, up from $1.96 per share in the year-earlier period, according to FactSet. UnitedHealth has beat the FactSet earnings consensus in all but one quarter over the last five years. The software platform Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge funds, academics and others, has the company earning slightly more, or $2.40 per share.

What to watch for: Despite UnitedHealth’s exit from most of the ACA exchanges, the GOP effort to repeal and replace the ACA could still affect the company, including through such things as taxes, said Mizuho’s Skolnick. “Political/health policy risks could be significant and future national health policy remains highly uncertain,” she said. Other risks include missteps in estimating cost trends and other actuarial calculations and in the Optum services business, Skolnick said. The company could be affected by reimbursement and regulatory risks, although “the timing and extent of such changes are usually out of the company’s control and therefore could represent exogenous events with negative earnings and stock price implications,” she said. Pressure on UnitedHealth’s medical-loss ratio, or the amount of a premium that health insurers spend on improving quality, could also be an important factor, said Credit Suisse’s Fidel. UnitedHealth is also being investigated by the Justice Department over its Medicare risk adjustment practices.

383,Philip van Doorn,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Published: July 17, 2017 8:56 a.m. ET Ziad Bakri, manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund, looks for three main themes in his stock picks By Ziad Bakri steered the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund to a 20% return in the first half of the year with big bets on biotechnology stocks. A change in the political climate in Washington might make his job easier, he said. Bakri said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had a “more accommodating” approach to approvals of new drugs, which began under the Obama administration and has become even more of a trend with President Trump. Dr. Scott Gottlieb was confirmed as commissioner of the FDA in May, after having served as the agency’s deputy under President George W. Bush. He’s done consulting work with drug companies, yet is also viewed as an independent thinker. “Starting on the generic side, there are processes in place to speed up approval for drugs that have very few competitors in the market,” Bakri said. “So there are things influencing how we think about the business.” The T.

                                   which has $11.3 billion in assets, has been a long-term outperformer. It’s been awarded Morningstar’s highest rating of five stars. Here’s detail on how the fund’s returns have measured up: Bakri took over as the fund’s portfolio manager in April 2016 and before that worked as a biotechnology analyst for T. Rowe Price since 2011. He is a medical doctor and also a certified financial analyst. In an interview July 12, Bakri attributed the fund’s success to a strong team of analysts in the U.S., Europe and Japan, including “MDs and PhDs” who attend medical conferences. “We do a lot of analysis of clinical trials and outcomes, making educated bets,” he said. While stocks in some sectors, such as energy or utilities, have a tendency to move in line as commodity prices or other environment factors change, the biotech industry is very “stock-specific,” he said. Those “educated bets” can even include privately held companies with drugs under development. Don’t miss:  Scared of tech stocks? Health-care shares are cheaper — and rallying One theme Bakri discussed was “investing in companies that advance the standard of care in an area of medicine with an unmet need.” Gilead Sciences Inc.

                                   is a good example, he said, pointing to the success of its Harvoni hepatitis C medication. Gilead’s sales more than doubled in 2014 after Harvoni was introduced, with revenue up another 31% in 2015. But sales declined 7% last year, with lower demand and reduced prices. Gilead has recently been a victim of its success in curing so many people who were suffering from hepatitis C, and Bakri said he had greatly reduced the fund’s position in the stock. But he still feels good about the company’s long-term prospects, because of the strength of its management team and its HIV medication business, “which is a growth area for the company over the next 10 years.” Another theme Bakri talked about was “investing in companies that improve the delivery of care and allow it to be delivered at a lower cost.” He said UnitedHealth Group Inc.

You guys r idiots @united HOW U PUT MY DOG ON THE WRONG FLIGHT???? I need answers It’s just the latest in passenger flaps facing United, including the April incident in which police dragged a 69-year-old passenger from a plane at Chicago O’Hare after he wouldn’t go along with a bump to accommodate United staff. Earlier in 2017, United staff would not board two girls flying on a free company pass for violating its dress code, an exchange marked by another passenger that set off its own Twitter flurry. The rapper said he arrived in Burbank, Calif., after a Denver layover on a flight from Missouri to find that his dog had actually flown to Chicago. United Airlines said in an initial statement that the dog was being well cared for and acknowledged that its customers consider pets part of the family. “Our customer’s dog was safely reunited with its owner Friday evening. We have been in touch with our customer to sincerely apologize for this mistake and are providing a refund,” United spokesperson Erin Benson emailed to MarketWatch.

385,Mengjie (Jessie) Jiang,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Published: July 20, 2017 2:58 p.m. ET By WASHINGTON — Negotiations for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement should give President Donald Trump “a victory,” but not at the expense of Mexico and Canada, Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton said Thursday. MacNaughton, speaking at a forum sponsored by the Washington International Trade Association, acknowledged the necessity to revamp the 23-year-old accord given the transformation of businesses, but emphasized a successful revamp should be flexible and “do no harm.” Mexican Ambassador Gerónimo Gutiérrez agreed, saying said Mexico has benefited tremendously from the three-nation trade pact and is looking for a “win-win-win” solution. The Trump administration said Monday its top priority for the talks was to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. In an 18-page summary of objectives, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he would work to reduce the trade imbalance by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico. Gutiérrez said the overarching objective would not be simply U.S. trade deficit reduction -- the three governments are interested in creating more and better jobs. “We have to move away from talking about the macroeconomic impacts of NAFTA, and emphasize the local impact on people,” said Gutiérrez. “We must listen to what people have to say. I think there are people in America who feel left out from benefits of Nafta.” Gutiérrez noted that Mexico proposed an anticorruption addition to Nafta. The newly released U.S. objectives include renegotiating intellectual property rights, stricter labor laws, enhanced environmental laws and tougher rules on the origin of products. The U.S. also reportedly wants to get rid of a system under Nafta that prevents the U.S. from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexico and Canada. “It makes sense to have a dispute resolution mechanism,” said MacNaughton. “We have to find ways where President Trump can claim victory without it being a loss to Canada or Mexico.” The first round of talks will take place Aug.16 to Aug.20 in Washington, Lighthizer’s office said in a statement Wednesday. Officials from the three countries plan to hold seven round of talks at three-week intervals to finish the Nafta renegotiation rapidly. Lighthizer has said he hopes the negotiations could be wrapped up by the end of the year, which he called a “very, very quick” time frame, but added that “we’re not going to have a bad agreement to save time.” When Nafta was created in 1994, the U.S. ran a small trade surplus with Mexico and Canada. In 2016, the United States had a nearly $11 billion trade deficit in goods with Canada and a $64 billion gap with Mexico. Trump called the trade agreement “the worse trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere” and threatened to pull out if he can’t push the trilateral trade accord to the best interest of the U.S. “I think people don’t understand how close we were [to withdrawal from Nafta],” said Gutiérrez. “Every political actor in the United States who understands the importance of Nafta needs to be vocal about it.” ",What Mexico and Canada want from the Nafta renegotiation - MarketWatch,0.9938
386, ,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Supported by By Keith Bradsher SHANGHAI — China’s top leaders have gathered every five years since 1997 for a National Financial Work Conference. At past gatherings, they have created entire regulatory agencies and rearranged the rules for huge markets, almost overnight. So economists and regulators have been almost breathlessly speculating about this summer’s work conference. Would the regulatory commissions overseeing the banking, securities and insurance industries be merged into the central bank? Would the legal definition of securities be broadened to shed some regulatory daylight on widespread activities like shadow banking, peer-to-peer online investment networks and off-balance-sheet wealth management products? But the actual results of the two-day work conference, which ended on Saturday afternoon, were much more, well, modest, to put it politely. The biggest accomplishment of the conference appeared to be an announcement that a commission would be established under the auspices of the cabinet. The commission would meet regularly to discuss issues of financial stability. But the leaders of the various financial regulatory agencies already meet regularly at the offices of the State Council, which is China’s cabinet, although these meetings are not officially at the level of a commission. Some economists speculated in the final days before the two-day conference that at least the State Council meetings would be moved to the central bank. Allowing the central bank to serve tea and provide a conference room might give the central bank staff a little extra confidence by allowing them to negotiate as hosts. The central bank also has a history of advocating broader financial reforms than the other principal financial regulatory agencies: the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. But the leaders did not even move the meetings away from the State Council’s offices to the central bank. And the result of the conference fell far short of predictions that the regulatory agencies might become clearly subservient to the central bank. The statement that accompanied the end of the conference did mention that the central bank had a role to play in preventing systemic financial risk. That is already the role of central banks in many countries. But Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a research group based in Shanghai, said that the specific mention of it in the statement might strengthen the central bank’s hand somewhat. But he was skeptical of the new commission, noting that it would lack legal powers and have very few staff members. “China failed to achieve a real breakthrough in financial regulatory reform, and the rising conflicts between financial regulation and financial realities will continue to create troubles in the coming years,” Mr. Liu said. Overall debt has been soaring in China, and Moody’s Investors Service downgraded China’s sovereign debt rating by a notch on May 24 on concerns that China has struggled to contain further increases in that debt. Chinese officials are quick to acknowledge the importance of financial health to the Chinese economy, which has become the world’s second-largest economy after the United States’, with extensive links to practically every other country around the world. State-controlled media carried a statement that described President Xi Jinping of China as having said at the conference, “Finance is an important core competitiveness of the country, financial security is an important part of national security, and the financial system is an important economic and social development of the basic system.” The apparently meager results from the conference underline not just bureaucratic resistance to change, which Mr. Xi probably has the political muscle to overcome, but the very real and complex policy dilemmas facing China. One example lies in the vast, lightly regulated off-balance-sheet activities of Chinese banks, which Mizuho Securities calculated on Friday to be roughly equal to the entire assets on the balance sheets of the banking industry. Regulators in the West would probably force banks to move these activities as quickly as possible onto their balance sheets, which would probably have the effect of curtailing them. But many of these off-balance-sheet activities, like various kinds of loan guarantees, are crucial to providing financing for China’s vigorous small and medium-size enterprises. These smaller businesses have had little luck competing with large, state-owned enterprises for conventional bank loans. But they account for the bulk of the job creation in China, at a time when the government is trying to slim down chronically loss-making industries like steel manufacturing and coal mining that are also big employers. Other financial regulatory disputes in China involve bureaucratic turf issues. One question lies in how to modernize China’s antiquated securities law, which still applies only to stocks and bonds and lacks provisions to cover the more complex instruments issued these days by insurance companies, banks, online lenders and other types of financial institutions. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has pushed hard for the broadest possible definition of securities, which would give it much greater influence. The banking and insurance regulators have resisted this, contending that many of the new financial instruments are extensions of banking and insurance. One mystery left unresolved by the statement at the end of the conference lies in who will run the top financial regulatory agencies in the years ahead, particularly the central bank. Zhou Xiaochuan has been the governor of the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, since 2002, making him one of the world’s longest-serving central bankers. Mr. Zhou is already more than two years past the usual retirement age for Chinese officials at his level. He received a special dispensation from the usual age limits by being allowed to join a senior government advisory body that is exempt from age limits. Central banking specialists in China cite two likely front-runners to succeed him. One is Jiang Chaoliang, the Communist Party secretary of Hubei province and a former chairman of the Agricultural Bank of China. The other is Guo Shuqing, a former governor of Shandong province who in February became the chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsher.

387,George Friedman,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Published: July 17, 2017 8:40 a.m. ET Diverse interests and regional divides threaten social stability By China’s actions so far in the ongoing North Korean affair have been ambiguous. In order to try to understand China’s strategy toward North Korea, it is necessary to understand China’s strategy in general. To do that, it is important to recognize the imperatives and constraints that drive the country. First, we need to outline China’s basic geographical parts. The country has four buffer regions that are under its control. Tibet in the southwest has seen some instability and is vulnerable to outside influences. Xinjiang in the northwest is predominantly Muslim, with a significant insurgency but not one that threatens Chinese control. Inner Mongolia in the north is stable. Manchuria in the northeast is also stable and of all four buffers is the most integrated with the Chinese core. These last two regions are now dominated by the Han Chinese, China’s main ethnic group, but they are still distinct. When you look at a map of China, you will see that a good part of what we think of China is not ethnically Chinese. Within Han China, there are also divisions. The population is concentrated in the east because western China has limited rainfall and can’t sustain extremely large populations. In this sense, China is actually a relatively narrow country, with a highly dense population. The interests within Han China are also diverse, and this has frequently led to fragmentation and civil war. The most important distinction is the one between coastal China and interior China. Coastal China, when left to its own devices, is involved in regional and global maritime trade, while the interior has fewer commercial opportunities. Coastal China’s priority is reaching its customers, whereas the interior wants Beijing to transfer the wealth from the coast to help support the poor interior. Many other regional disagreements exist of course, but this is the source of discord between the two regions. It is not a new problem, and left to fester, it can result in internal conflict, with coastal interests frequently seeking intervention by their customers. This was the case from the British intervention in the mid-19th century until 1947. During this time, there was endless internal conflict in China and constant foreign involvement. Mao Zedong tried to solve the problem by closing China to trade (at least somewhat), crushing the coastal elite, and imposing a dictatorship. Like emperors before him, he imposed a powerful state on a unified but nonetheless very poor country. After Mao died, China embarked on a traditional Chinese strategy: It tried to build its economy by selling low-priced manufactured goods to the world without allowing divisions to arise — in other words, it wanted to have its cake and eat it too. This worked for a generation; once the state stopped undermining economic development, China surged. By 2006, exports, particularly to the United States and Europe, accounted for 37% of China’s gross domestic product. The coastal region became relatively prosperous, while the rest of China and the buffer regions lagged far behind, as they always have. But the surging economy helped raise living standards, even if it also created inequality. 2008 was a turning point. China’s major customers, Europe and the U.S., went into recession, and their appetite for Chinese goods declined. Economic growth slowed dramatically, and by 2016, exports only contributed 19% of China’s GDP. Although internal consumption increased, the coastal region was focused on markets in advanced industrial countries, which the interior couldn’t replace. In the process of maintaining weakening businesses, saving jobs, and increasing domestic demand, the cost of production rose. China faced competition from other countries for markets, and the pressure on its internal system intensified. Coastal and regional interests diverged again, and each advocated different policies in response to the crisis. The Chinese government tried to accommodate all but accommodated none. In 2012, President Xi Jinping took office and sought to put the genie back in the bottle. He imposed a dictatorship that had two goals: to take control of the Communist Party and to impose party rule over the country. His anti-corruption campaign was intended to take control of the economy and to convince the interior that he was not a pawn of the coastal region. Xi sought to maintain exports as much as possible and to re-establish centralized control with minimal effect on the economy. Xi also had to deal with the U.S. — a major engine of China’s export-driven economy. At the same time, the crackdown on government and business officials — an essentially political act — would affect American investments and other interests in China. China had to take greater control of the economy without losing U.S. investment or imports. But in case the worst happened, China developed a fallback strategy. It began producing a new class of high-tech products. It also had to find new markets outside the U.S. China’s economic solution posed a military problem. In the event there was an economic falling out with the U.S., China had to consider the possibility of a military confrontation. But the key issue was the ability to guarantee China’s access to sea lanes. In this, China has a major geographic problem. The South- and East China seas are ringed with small islands, spaced in such a way that passage between them can be blocked with relative ease. The U.S. Navy is far superior to the Chinese navy, and the Chinese were concerned that in some unforeseen crisis the U.S. would block access to their much needed sea lanes. Those small islands were now at the center of Chinese national interest. The Chinese could claim the entire region, but they were not in a position to seize it. At the same time, the Chinese devised a political solution to their strategic concern. If a country like Indonesia or the Philippines aligned with China instead of with the U.S., access to the global sea lanes would be assured without having to confront the U.S. The dilemma here is that the two strategies undermined each other. Aggressive assertion of Chinese power in the regional waters and finding accommodation with regional powers were inconsistent approaches. What’s more, they could only work if the United States was not present. And, of course, it was. China had one other option for getting around potential U.S. actions: creating an alternative export route through Asia to Europe. This was the so-called One Belt, One Road concept. But it, too, was flawed. First, the cost of building the requisite infrastructure was staggering. Second, it would run through countries that were unstable and, for the Chinese, unimportant customers. Add to that the speed with which One Belt, One Road needed to be enacted, and this was more posturing than policy. China, therefore, is caught in a set of interlocking problems. Its economic miracle has matured into more normal growth rates. It has a vast population that lacks the ability to consume all that it produces. It has to contend with global stagnation and competition from other producers — and competing with high-tech producers is no small task. China is therefore afraid of internal instability and has imposed a dictatorship designed to maintain a vibrant economy without social costs. To do that, it must increase exports and control access to China’s economy, a move designed to alienate a large and dangerous power, the United States. But it can’t afford to confront the U.S., whose navy it can’t defeat. The Chinese are caught between the need to placate the U.S. and to distract it with as many problems as possible. North Korea is a perfect diversion, but siding with Pyongyang is not an option. China can appear to be helping the United States while keeping the U.S. focused on Pyongyang. This is a strategy that emerges not from a position of strength but from one of fundamental weakness. China’s internal contradiction is that prosperity creates instability, and stability is incompatible with prosperity. There are complexities and nuances of course, but this is the root of China’s problem. China is therefore trying to maintain what prosperity it can without destabilizing the system. In doing this, it is jeopardizing its overseas markets, particularly the United States, creating the opportunity for a conflict it can’t win and opening the door to regionalism and warlordism. Unlike Japan, which moved from being a high-growth country to a low-growth country without social upheaval, China may not be so lucky. Japan had a homogeneous, socially integrated society. China is not homogenous, and it has irreconcilable social differences. Its global strategy reflects these contradictions and ultimately poses a greater risk to China itself than to others. In such a situation, the key is to look confident and try to keep others off balance. But this can only work for so long.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has broken out, reaching record territory. The June peak (2,453) pivots to support, and is followed by the former range top, circa 2,442. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sustained a break to all-time highs. Here again, the June peak (21,535) marks an inflection point, and is followed by a deeper floor, circa 21,450. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has knifed from six-week lows to its second-best close on record. Tactically, the 6,280 area marks an inflection point, and is followed by support matching the former range top, circa 6,243. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed from a double bottom — the jagged W formation, defined by the June and July lows — to its second-best close on record. The Nasdaq’s record close (6,321.76) and absolute record peak (6,341.70) rest just overhead. Conversely, the late-June peak (6,303) marks an inflection point, and is followed by potential floors better illustrated on the hourly chart. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has sustained the July breakout. Recall that it had notched three consecutive record closes before Monday’s slight eight-point downturn. The breakout opens the path to a near-term projected target, circa 21,780. Conversely, the June peak (21,535) pivots to notable support. Similarly, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. Here again, the index has reached uncharted territory, punctuating consecutive tests of the 2,405 breakout point. The June low (2,405) and July low (2,407) closely matched support. As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a bullish third-quarter start. The S&P 500 and Dow industrials have reached all-time highs — uncharted territory — while the Nasdaq Composite has concurrently registered its second-best close on record.

                                   is rattling the cage on a breakout. Its record close (142.10) and absolute record peak (142.90) remain firmly within view following a successful test of the 50-day moving average. (The Russell 2000 itself, not the ETF illustrated above, has registered a nominal all-time high. The IWM missed a record close Monday by four cents.) Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is pressing uncharted territory amid seasonally lackluster volume. Its corresponding record close (322.45) and absolute record peak (322.75) remain within striking distance. More broadly, recall that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks are rising against a bullish longer-term backdrop, illustrated on the three-year chart. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is setting up well technically. Consider that the June/July range had been comparably flat, versus the preceding rally, and underpinned by the 2,405 support. Moreover, the prevailing breakout technically projects to the 2,500 mark, as detailed last week. (Take the S&P’s June peak: 2,453 - 2,405 = 48 points. Then, add back to the breakout point: 2,453 + 48 = 2,501.) All told, technical price action within a strong uptrend is constructive, and the third-quarter start fits the description. The S&P 500’s intermediate-term path of least resistance continues to point higher pending more aggressive selling pressure.

Two inflection points stand out: Tactically, a rally atop the 66.50 area would mark a “higher high” — combined with a break from the 50-day moving average — raising the flag to an intermediate-term trend shift. Such a move would also resolve a mini double bottom, a bullish reversal pattern, defined by the June and July lows. Based on today’s backdrop, the group’s intermediate-term downtrend is intact.

Technically, the shares are rising from a jagged double bottom — the W formation — defined by the June and July lows. The pattern is defined by consecutive successful tests of the breakout point, and an intervening mid-June spike, fueled by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Monday’s close, just one point under a record close, positions the shares for a potential breakout.

Earlier this month, the shares knifed to 11-year highs, rising after the monthly U.S. payrolls report signaled hiring strength in the construction industry. The ensuing pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to build on the initial spike. Tactically, first support matches the post-breakout low (36.20) and is followed by the breakout point, circa 34.40. A posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias.

The shares initially spiked eight weeks ago, rising after the company hosted its World Data Center Forum and subsequent positive analyst remarks. The May spike punctuated a successful test of the 200-day moving average. The ensuing pullback has been relatively orderly, underpinned by the breakout point, and the 50-day moving average. Tactically, the prevailing range top defines record territory. The recent tight one-week range signals muted selling pressure at resistance, improving the chances of eventual follow-through. An intermediate-term target projects to the 67 area on a breakout.

The upturn places the shares in less-charted territory — illustrated on the three-year chart — opening the path to potentially material follow-through. Tactically, the breakout point (16.90) pivots to support, and a posture higher supports a bullish bias.

That is: If the Republicans can’t make headway with President Trump’s top legislative priority, the so-called repeal and replace (or even mere repeal) of the Affordable Care Act, then what are the odds for the enthusiastically anticipated project of stimulating the economy? That should be a concern for stocks, though they are a bit preoccupied right now with earnings. Goldman Sachs has taken some of the air out of futures after posting a trading slump. If earnings are the name of the game, then keep an eye on Netflix

                                   , which is ready to bust higher after another batch of crowd-pleasing results. That brings us to our call of the day, which suggests — gulp — that it may be time for investors to cash in on some of the streaming-media company’s good fortune. “While we remain positive in the long-term fundamental outlook of the business, including its ability to disrupt the traditional incumbents and grow international, our analysis also suggests that the current price already reflects this view,” wrote Citi’s Mark May in a note this morning. He upped the share-price target to $180 from $160, with the stock set to open not far from there — and at record heights. Note that plenty of other analysts were lifting their price targets on Netflix this morning, with several pushing them past the $200-a-share level. There’s more on that view from David Butler, a contributor for Seeking Alpha, who observed that chasing Netflix now is an “expensive affair.” “It seems to be following the same mania as Tesla and Amazon, where investors will run the price up on speculation alone, regardless of actual earnings,” he wrote. Netflix shareholders right now https://t.co/D5UxMDJ8ZY$NFLX pic.twitter.com/l4BBJQEI2o Note that Tesla CEO Elon Musk felt compelled to turn a cooling fire hose on his own investors over the weekend, saying the electric-car maker’s share price is “higher than we have the right to deserve.” Those shares have come off this week, but are still up around 50% in 2017. A noted hedge-fund manager also said it’s time to short Netflix, which is up about 30% so far this year. Flick through StockTwits, and you’ll find plenty of caution over Netflix shares. One worry: The forward price/earnings ratio for Netflix is currently hovering at 197 times (according to FactSet), which is higher than the 190 times for Amazon. Price-Earnings ratio: Amazon 180, Netflix 195 and Tesla 😏, when classic fundamental analyses might lose interest at a PE ratio of 18 Still, Netflix may just keep rocketing higher today, because investors don’t seem ready to fall out of love as yet with the company that brought us, sigh, “Stranger Things.” The world has never been more in love with America. $NFLX https://t.co/lxMAMwJrek We may want to blame Goldman for a weaker start.

                                    intentions in the food space, but were nervous that Amazon could pose a large competitive threat. Amazon applied July 6 to trademark the phrase “We do the prep, you be the chef.” The filing says the phrase is related to “Prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and vegetables and also including sauces or seasonings, ready for cooking and assembly as a meal.” The filing is under 1B status, meaning it’s an application “based on intent to use,” according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Going up against the internet giant does not necessarily mean it’s the end for Blue Apron, but it “makes life hard,” said Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Institutional. Amazon has a large economy of scale, meaning that the company can likely produce products at a lower cost, and has an advanced distribution network, which could be enhanced by its acquisition of Whole Foods. Read more: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer Blue Apron appeared to acknowledge the threat from Amazon as it added a risk factor to its filing ahead of the IPO and around the timing of Amazon’s bid around the consolidation of companies. “Business combinations and consolidation in and across the industries in which we compete could further increase the competition we face and result in competitors with significantly greater resources and customer bases than us,” the company said in its prospectus. On the other hand, Judge Graham, chief marketing officer of Ansira, a marketing agency, said while he’s generally “an optimistic guy,” he does see Amazon’s entrance into the space as a “potential death sentence” for Blue Apron. “Amazon continues to dominate the direct consumer space,” Graham said. “This is just one more avenue Amazon is going to go in and dominate.” Still, Wolff said he believes Blue Apron could combat the threat by becoming more “niche focused” or teaming up with another player, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Graham also sees potential if Blue Apron delivers better recipes or better quality of food, which is something the company touted in its prospectus. Meanwhile, the company needs to communicate better and prove to the public and investors that its business model will not be affected by Amazon. “I think the confidence is broken, so every possible setback gets an exaggerated importance,” Wolff said. Analysts have also been cautious on Blue Apron because of its subscription model, which has yet to prove whether it’s sustainable. It also has a high customer acquisition cost, which is a cost Amazon is unlikely to face as it already has an established base of Prime customers. A meal-kit offering would likely do well with this base of customers, who likely are already focused on convenience and quick delivery, said Jim Fosina, chief executive of Fosina Marketing Group. That base, in addition to Amazon’s ability to market should make Blue Apron and others “very concerned,” he said. “They have a installed base that mirrors the population of customers that are in the sweet spot of those interested in these services,” Fosina said. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 21% month-to-date, while the S&P 500 index

393,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"(Reuters) - Mediware Information Systems Inc [MEDWI.UL], a healthcare technology company owned by private equity firm TPG Capital LP, has hired Bill Miller to lead the company as it looks to build out its presence in post-acute care and human services, the company said on Thursday. Miller was previously the chief executive officer of OptumInsight, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc, the world’s largest healthcare services company. He will replace Kelly Mann, who has been CEO of Mediware since 2007. “I am excited about their strong position in the expanding markets they serve, and look forward to working with TPG and the Mediware team to build on the momentum that the company has achieved to-date,” Miller said in a statement. TPG Capital completed its acquisition of Mediware from buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. Mediware sells software programs that help with administration and costs savings to healthcare providers including blood banks, behavioral health providers, home healthcare providers and more. It is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, as healthcare providers aim to cut costs through the use of new technologies and increasingly rely on outpatient care centers rather than traditional hospitals. As chief executive of Mediware, Miller told Reuters he plans on pursuing a balanced growth strategy across its various areas of focus, ranging from human services to home health and more. He added that he Mediware will rely on a blend of organic growth and acquisitions. Earlier this year, Mediware acquired Kinnser Software, which provides software for home health and hospice providers. Thoma Bravo took Mediware private in 2012 for $195 million and built it out with acquisitions including Bowman Systems, which focuses on homeless management. TPG has previously invested in other healthcare technology companies including Evolent Health and IMS Health. ","

394,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans narrowly agreed on Tuesday to open debate on a bill to end Obamacare, but the party’s seven-year effort to roll back Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law still faces significant hurdles. The Senate deadlocked 50-50 on moving forward with the healthcare debate, forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Senator John McCain, who was diagnosed this month with brain cancer and has been recovering from surgery at home in Arizona, made a dramatic return to the U.S. Capitol to cast a crucial vote in favor of proceeding. The outcome was a huge relief for President Donald Trump, who had pushed his fellow Republicans hard in recent days to live up to the party’s campaign promises to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Minutes after the vote, Trump called it “a big step.” But the narrow victory on a simple procedural matter raised questions about whether Republicans can muster the votes necessary to pass any of the various approaches to repeal. Moderates are worried repeal will cost millions of low-income Americans their insurance and conservatives are angry the proposed bills do not go far enough to gut Obamacare, which they consider government overreach. In a first vote of the many likely to come this week, the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that Senate Republicans have been working on for months failed to get the 60 votes needed for approval on Tuesday night. The vote was 43 in favor and 57 against. Nine Republicans, ranging from moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine to conservatives such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the bill, which would have made deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and reduced Obamacare subsidies to lower-income people to help them defray the cost of health insurance. Earlier McCain, 80, received an ovation from his fellow senators when he entered the chamber to cast a vote to open debate. After that vote, he decried growing partisanship in the Senate and urged members to learn how “to trust each other again.” Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski were the only Republicans to oppose the measure to open debate, and with Republicans controlling the Senate by a 52-48 majority, those were the only votes the party leadership could afford to lose. Democrats were united in opposition to the motion to proceed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who cast the last and deciding vote to open debate, engaged in a heated discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before casting his vote and ending the suspense. A loss on the vote to open debate on Tuesday could have been a death blow for Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and cast doubt on Trump’s prospects to achieve any of his other top legislative agenda items, including tax reform. “We have a duty to act,” McConnell told senators before the vote, reminding Republicans they had promised to repeal Obamacare in four straight elections. “We can’t let this moment slip by.” Republicans have found it difficult to fulfill their campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance. Polls show Obamacare is now far more popular than the Republican alternatives. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senate’s replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. The health industry has watched the debate nervously, and after the vote some groups urged the Senate to reconsider its approach. America’s Essential Hospitals, a group representing safety-net hospitals, said in a statement it strongly opposed all the Republican plans and feared the big cuts in Medicaid in the bills “would jeopardize the health and financial security of millions of working people and families.” As the debate vote opened, more than two dozen protesters in the Senate chamber chanted “kill the bill” before they were removed. Senators said several approaches have been discussed, including a straight repeal of Obamacare with no replacement plan, or repealing and replacing the law while also overhauling Medicaid. Senate Republicans also could consider a shortened version of repeal, called a “skinny repeal,” which would end the mandates in Obamacare on individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and a medical device tax, a Senate aide and a lobbyist said. “Some of us want clean repeal, some of us want the Senate leadership bill, they’re both going to get a vote early on and I think that’s a fair way to do it,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said. “If either one of them fails and another one succeeds, maybe we can find something in between that actually succeeds.” Republican Senator Bob Corker said the goal was to gain enough votes to get a bill through the Senate and send it to the House of Representatives, which passed its own bill to replace Obamacare in May, for negotiations. “Everybody understands this is just a first step,” he said. Several of the Democrats opposing the motion for debate were from conservative states that backed Trump in 2016 and face tough re-election bids next year, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana. “We have a good chance to beat this,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after the vote. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, praised Collins and Murkowski for taking a principled stand against the Republican move to open debate. “That wasn’t easy,” Durbin said. “That was an act of political courage on their part; I’m sure they were under tremendous pressure.” ","

395,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"ASPEN, Colorado (Reuters) - The Trump administration is developing the first comprehensive strategy to defend the United States against disease pandemics and biological attacks by terrorists, the top White House homeland security official said on Thursday. “We have not had as a country a comprehensive bio-defense strategy ever,” White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert told the annual Aspen Security Forum, in Aspen, Colorado. “It’s high time we had a bio-defense strategy.” The effort involves retired Admiral Tim Ziemer, who oversaw the Obama administration’s initiative to fight malaria in Africa, and the White House hopes to publish the new strategy “as soon as we can,” said Bossert, who provided no further details. Bossert noted that the Bush and Obama administrations took steps to address biological threats after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to two Democratic senators and several news organizations in the weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The spores infected 22 people, five of whom died. But, he added, “There have been a lot of fits and starts in our investments.” “At this point, we need to look clear eyed at the fact that we may have a devastating pandemic influenza or an intentional anthrax attack,” said Bossert. He noted recent news reports that scientists in Canada used commercially available genetic material to construct the extinct horse pox virus, a relative of the small pox virus, which claimed tens of millions of lives before being wiped out. “That’s (horsepox) not going to kill any of us, but that suggests that somebody might now in the future possess the ability to produce synthetic small pox without a live virus and that scares me to death,” he said. The threat of disease pandemics demands global attention, he said. Some experts have criticized the Trump administration for seeking reductions in funding for global health programs that they contend would hurt the country’s ability to prevent and respond to biological threats like pandemics. Bossert, however, said that the administration plans to give “full-throated support” to the Global Health Security Agenda, a partnership of more than 50 nations and international organizations that works to build countries’ capacities to prevent and fight infectious diseases.

396,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Genital surgery should be banned on children whose sex characteristics are ambiguous because the procedures can scar young patients for life and be considered human rights violations, a leading rights group said on Tuesday. Several hundred so-called intersex children in the United States have undergone sex reassignment surgery in recent years, and worldwide, doctors recommend surgery for an estimated one in every 2,000 intersex babies, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) and interACT, an advocacy group, said. Surgeries to make them resemble more typical boys or girls include removal of testes or ovaries, deepening shallow vaginas and enlarging small penises, they said in a report. They called for a U.S. moratorium on all surgical procedures on intersex children too young to participate in the decision. The surgeries amount to “human rights abuse taking place in a medical setting,” said Kyle Knight, a HRW researcher. “These surgeries are medically unnecessary, they are harmful and they haven’t delivered on the outcomes that were originally theorized,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. The report said the benefits of sex reassignment surgery remain unproven but the resulting harm can be catastrophic. Surgery can cause life-long pain, sterilization, loss of sexual sensation and health complications, it said. Some 1.7 percent of the world’s population, or 127.5 million people, is thought to be born intersex, according to the report. But detailed data on the U.S. intersex population, once called hermaphrodites, is largely lacking, Knight noted. The surgeries’ popularity dates back to 1960s’ research which concluded intersex people could be assigned typical male or female genitals if operated on early in their infancy, HRW and interACT said. In a recent open letter cited by the report, three former U.S. Surgeons General said plastic surgeries on genital organs “can cause . . . emotional distress.” Efforts to warn medical doctors about the risks have been ongoing since the 1990s but met with mixed success, the report said. It did find that a growing number of doctors are opposed to recommending surgery on intersex babies unless medically necessary, the report said after interviewing nearly two dozen health care practitioners. Various United Nations’ agencies have condemned the practice as violating fundamental human rights. In 2015, Malta became the first nation to ban non-consensual medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children. Belgian fashion model Hanne Gaby Odiele put a public spotlight on the issue earlier this year when she revealed she was born intersex. ","

397,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"Once again, the U.S. Navy has opened fire on an Iranian vessel in the Gulf. U.S. sailors fired warning shots Tuesday after the Iranian patrol boat – apparently operated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – came within 150 yards of the USS Thunderbolt. U.S. and Iranian ships have had tense encounters before, but these confrontations could become even more common - and potentially dangerous - if Washington intensifies its efforts to put more pressure on Tehran in general and the Revolutionary Guards in particular. Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to dismantle the Obama administration’s multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran, describing it as “the worst deal ever.” On July 17, the U.S. president reluctantly certified, for the second time since his election, that Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear pact known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). A day later, his administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran over its ballistic missile program, targeting 18 new entities and individuals for involvement in what it described as Iranian “malign activities” in the Middle East. Those sanctioned included backers of the IRGC, Iran’s powerful military and security organization. Founded in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and acting independently of the regular army, the IRGC is also one of Iran’s most powerful economic institutions, controlling several of its strategic industries as well as some of its armed forces. Washington’s ongoing efforts to put more pressure on the IRGC and proposals to designate it as a terrorist entity have raised tensions between the two old nemeses to a new level in the post-JCPOA era. READ MORE COMMENTARY FROM REUTERS Michael Rosenbaum: Want Congress to fast track health reform? Write bills to support business rather than people. Peter Van Buren: Drinking rum until I understand the Cuban embargo On the day that Trump confirmed Tehran’s nuclear observance, Iranian armed forces chief of staff Major General Mohammad Baqeri warned that incorporating IRGC in the blacklist of terrorist organizations could pose “a big risk for American and its bases and forces” in the region. In a similar reaction and shortly after the new U.S. penalties were announced, IRGC commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari warned that should Washington want to press ahead with the terrorist designation scheme, “it should [first] dismantle its bases within up to 1,000 kilometers of Iran.” Details of Tuesday’s maritime confrontation are still murky, and threatening bluster by officials on both sides is not new. However, the incident does underscore that Tehran can employ a number of options to jeopardize U.S. interests in the Middle East. However, Tuesday’s incident underscores that the Revolutionary Guards can resort to aggressive behavior against U.S. vessels in the Persian Gulf. In the starkest instance, Guard members embarrassed Washington by seizing 10 American crew members from two Navy boats that blundered into Iranian territorial waters in January 2016. The IRGC could also target U.S. forces without directly confronting them by deploying the proxy networks it has cultivated across the Middle East since the early 1980s. In the absence of reliable conventional allies, these networks typically form a key component of Iran’s “deterrence” strategy. The IRGC has particularly close ties with Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Tehran has traditionally relied on Hezbollah to confront Israel, but has also used its fighters for high-profile missions. On 18 July 2012, a suicide bomb attack on a tourist bus in the Bulgarian resort of Burgas killed five Israelis. U.S. intelligence officials believe that the allegedly Hezbollah-led attack was retaliation for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, which Tehran suspected was orchestrated by Israel. The IRGC could also use its surrogates to exploit U.S. vulnerabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tehran could also increase the pressure on American forces in Afghanistan by doubling down on military backing of the Taliban. As tensions have flared between the United States on the one hand and Iran and Russia on the other, the latter have already boosted support for the Taliban insurgents. With the growing engagement of the United States in the Syrian civil war under the Trump administration, Tehran could pursue a similar course in Syria too. U.S.-backed forces fighting Islamic State militants in the northeastern and eastern regions of the country would be particularly vulnerable. A Washington designation of the IRGC as a terrorist entity is unlikely to restrain the group. On the contrary, the label could even embolden the Corps to behave more aggressively by removing its reason for restraint. And that, in turn, could further destabilize the region.

398,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"(Reuters Health) - Being overweight or obese as a teenager may increase a person’s risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult, suggests a large Israeli study. Long-term follow-up of 1.79 million Israeli men and women examined for military service as teenagers showed that overweight and obese teens were over 50 percent more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer by middle age, compared to normal-weight peers. “The findings from the study show evidence that being overweight and obese in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancer in both men and woman,” said Dr. Avni Desai, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study “Obesity was also noted to have an association with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Other smaller studies have shown a possible association with obesity and adolescence and future risk of colorectal cancer, but this is the largest study to show the association,” Desai said, adding that in past research the association has been stronger for men. For the study, published in the journal Cancer, Dr. Zohar Levi, a researcher at Rabin Medical Center and Tel Aviv University and his team analyzed data from millions of Israeli adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service from 1967 to 2010. The young men and women were between the ages of 16 and 19 at the time of the examinations, and Levi’s team used a national cancer registry to track who was diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer through December 2012. The average follow-up was 23 years and the researchers identified almost 2,967 new cases of colorectal cancer in the study group. Among men, there were 1,403 cases of colon cancer and 574 cases of rectal cancer, and among women, 764 colon cancers and 226 rectal cancers. Being overweight or obese at the initial military examination was associated with 53 percent and 54 percent higher risks of colon cancer for men and women, respectively, compared to normal-weight peers. In men, obesity was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of rectal cancer, and in women, being obese more than doubled that risk. Levi did not respond to a request for comments. This study does have some limitations, said Desai. “It is looking at a specific group, Israeli Jewish men and women, the studied group included predominantly men.  As such it is unclear if the results would be similar in the general U.S. population,” she said. Additionally, the researchers didn’t have information about adult body weights, so it is unclear whether obese or overweight teens stayed heavy or slim teens gained weight in adulthood. “The study could not assess whether risk of colorectal cancer was related to adult obesity independent of adolescent obesity,” Desai said. “Also, other risk factors that may affect risk of colorectal cancer such as family history, level of physical activity, diet, and smoking were not reported in the study. Family history is a risk factor for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, especially at a young age.” Desai noted that although the participants were followed for at least 10 years, they were still fairly young at the end of the study. “The median age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study was 49.4 years, which is younger than the average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer,” she said, adding that 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50. The average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the United States is age 72, she added. “Again, it is hard to pinpoint the exact causes of colorectal cancer in young patients, what we do know is a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing cancer.  This includes regular exercise, and a healthy diet, low in fat, high in fiber, with less red meats and processed meats,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2tDgJgk Cancer, online July 24, 2017. ","

401, ,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen’s cholera outbreak is so widespread that just drinking water can lead to death. Nearly 2,000 people have already succumbed to one of the worst recorded outbreaks of cholera in modern history, with over 400,000 having contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization. Cholera, a diarrheal disease spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen’s devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. With stinking green watery filth mingled with trash being a common sight in the capital Sanaa, the government is struggling to control the spread of the disease. Pumps to sanitize the water supply sit idle for lack of fuel, while maintenance agencies tasked with chlorinating aquifers go without salaries and supplies. Since Yemen’s government took control of central bank funds, it no longer pays most civil servants in Houthi-held lands. This means that most of those working in and around Sanaa have not been paid for six months, ruining the lives of hospital and sanitation workers. Meanwhile, the parched and mountainous country is in danger of running out of water, leaving its 28 million mostly impoverished citizens facing another crisis. A dearth of clean water has forced many residents to queue up and fill jerry cans from water trucks. The United Nations estimates that in Yemen a child under the age of five dies every 10 minutes from preventable causes, two million people have fled fighting near their homes and only half of hospitals have staff and supplies to function normally.

402, ,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has outlined plans to become a world-leader in artificial intelligence by 2025, laying down a challenge to U.S. dominance in the sector amid heightened international tensions over military applications of the technology. China released a national AI development plan late on Thursday, aiming to grow the country’s core AI industries to over 150 billion yuan ($22.15 billion) by 2020 and 400 billion yuan ($59.07 billion) by 2025, the State Council said. With this major push into AI, China is looking to rival U.S. market leaders such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp, as it is keen not to be left behind in a technology that is increasingly key from smart cars to energy. “The local and central government are supporting this AI effort,” said Rui Yong, chief technology officer at PC maker Lenovo Group, speaking on the sidelines of an AI conference in Shanghai on Thursday. “They see this trend coming and they want to invest more.” Beijing’s AI plan comes as the United States is poised to bolster its scrutiny of investments, including artificial intelligence, over fears that countries including China could access technology of strategic military importance. China’s State Council said the “situation with China on national security and international competition is complex”, which was part of the incentive for making a domestic AI push. “We must take initiative to firmly grasp this new stage of development for artificial intelligence and create a new competitive edge,” it said. China’s plan follows a similar national AI development plan released by the United States in October 2016. The roadmap says China aims to catch up to global leaders by solving issues including a lack of high-end computer chips, software and trained personnel. Beijing would also play a bigger role via policy support and regulation. China has already invested heavily in AI, while Chinese Premier Li Keqiang named it as a strategic technology in an annual report earlier this year. In February, the country’s powerful state planner opened an AI lab in partnership with Baidu Inc, the country’s top search engine, which is making a major push in to AI. Lenovo’s Rui said official support for AI was because it was seen as the latest “industrial revolution” akin to the advent of the combustion engine, electricity or the Internet. “They see the fourth industrial revolution as coming, (and think) we better invest and support and build a very strong ecosystem,” said Rui.

403, ,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A crisis between Qatar and four Arab countries is straining a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s government in a two-year war against Iranian-aligned Houthis and slowing the alliance’s military advances. At the heart of the crisis is the accusation that Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that coalition mainstays Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have designated a terrorist group. But Yemen’s government is packed with supporters of the Islah party, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, threatening the unity of the alliance which has already been weakened by the withdrawal of Qatar’s forces after the row erupted on June 5. “The Gulf rift has cast a shadow on the government and could split it as ministers linked to Islah sympathise with Qatar,” a senior official in the Yemeni government, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The coalition is seeking to restore the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and backs forces fighting Houthi rebels and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Fighting near the Red Sea port city of al-Mokha, where a UAE-backed offensive was being prepared on the port of Hodeidah which handles most of Yemeni food imports, has slowed. “The fighting has been frozen since the start of the dispute with Qatar, which reflects the extent of the UAE concerns over the strength of Islah in the province,” a local official told Reuters. UAE officials did not respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia currently hosts the exiled Yemeni government which includes five cabinet ministers from the Islah party. The chief of staff also belongs to Islah and Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar is a close Islah ally. The party also has thousands of followers fighting against the Houthi forces who control the capital Sanaa with Saleh loyalists. Unusually in Yemen’s fractured political landscape, Islah has supporters in the north and south of the country. Since the Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood, in deference to the government-in-exile’s Saudi hosts. The coalition depends heavily on Islah fighters on the ground. “Whatever Saudi Arabia’s current view of the Muslim Brotherhood in other countries, in Yemen they are natural allies against the Houthi-Saleh alliance,” April Longley Alley, a senior Arabian Peninsula analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG) said. “In many fighting fronts in the north, tribesmen or soldiers associated with Islah are a critical, if not the most important, part of the anti-Houthi fighting force.” Saudi officials were not immediately available for comment. The Brotherhood has posed a big challenge to Arab rulers in the Middle East, where it has built a strong base opposed to the principle of dynastic rule. While Qatar has supported the movement, Gulf monarchies and emirates, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have spent billions trying to prevent the Brotherhood holding power in the Arab world since 2011 uprisings swept the region. The UAE, a crucial member of the coalition and which is more hostile to the Brotherhood than other members, appears to have been the most uncomfortable about its military fighting alongside Brotherhood-linked Islah forces. The UAE has also built a southern army that remains under the influence of southern Yemeni politicians who are hostile to the Brotherhood’s ideology and want to break with the north. On the frontlines in the south, the offensive against the Houthis and Saleh forces has slowed down because of the UAE position on Islah, local officials said.

Fighting in the two strategic provinces of Taiz and Marib has halted for more than a month, except for occasional air strikes and naval shelling on the rebels. Cracks in the Yemeni government on the Qatar crisis were  highlighted when the quarrel broke out with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates imposing travel and diplomatic sanctions on Qatar. Yemen’s government rushed to express solidarity with Qatar on the state news agency website. Within two hours that message of support was wiped off.

The minimum wage is a legally mandated price floor on hourly wages, below which non-exempt workers may not be offered or accept a job. As of 2017, the federal minimum wage rate in the United States is $7.25 per hour. This means that it is illegal for an American worker to sell their labor for less than $7.25 per hour unless the worker falls into a category specifically exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Minimum wage laws were first used in Australia and New Zealand in an attempt to raise the income of unskilled workers. Most modern developed economies and many underdeveloped economies enforce a national minimum wage. Examples of countries with no established minimum wage include Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Singapore. Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may also pass different minimum wage requirements as long as the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. An employer who is subject to the federal and state minimum wage requirement must pay the higher of the two. States will usually set a minimum wage that is reflective of the cost of living in the region. For example, the state of Massachusetts has a minimum wage of $11 per hour, compared to Arkansas which has a minimum wage rate of $8.50. As of 2017, minimum wage rates exceeded the federal rate in 29 of the 50 states, led by Massachusetts and Washington at $11 per hour. Some states like Alabama, New Hampshire, and South Carolina have no state minimum wage. Cities and municipalities may also set a minimum wage for their residents which must be higher than the federal minimum wage. For example, even though the state of Illinois set its minimum wage at $8.25, the city of Chicago has a minimum wage of $11.00. The government periodically assesses the federal minimum wage level for changes in inflation or cost of living. The table shows the minimum wage set at each state level. Some states have set their minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage, others have set the same minimum wage as the federal rate, and a select few don't have a minimum wage requirement. In the latter case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 will apply. Like all price floors, a minimum wage law only has a measurable effect when set above the market clearing price for a transaction. For example, a minimum wage of $10 per hour will have no effect for workers whose marginal productivity in a given line of work is greater than $10 per hour. The legal supply and demand remains unchanged for such labor. For those with a marginal productivity less than $10 per hour, however, a $10 per hour minimum wage creates an artificial shortage of profitable labor. An unskilled worker with a marginal productivity of $8 per hour in California or Massachusetts can only offer to work at a loss to his or her potential employer — that is, the employer can only hire the worker if they are willing to pay more in salary than marginal revenue produced by the worker, or unless the employer incorrectly estimates the worker’s marginal productivity to be above $10 per hour. Several groups of individuals are exempt from being paid the minimum wage. Individuals that fall into these groups are usually paid below the minimum wage in order to incentivize companies to hire them. Low-skilled laborers in the United States can be exempted from the minimum wage if a sizable portion of their income is derived from tips. If exempted, a lower minimum wage of $2.13 per hour applies to tipped employees who regularly receive more than $30 in tips per month, or if the total tips retained in addition to the hourly wage rate is equal to or greater than the federal minimum wage. In a case where the employee’s total tips and hourly rate falls below the minimum wage, the employer is expected to compensate the employee for the shortfall. A full-time student working for a university, retail store, or service establishment can be paid not less than 85% of the minimum wage. Although students may work up to 8 hours per day, they cannot work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. In addition, students in a technical or vocational program can be paid not less than 75% of the minimum wage throughout their active enrollment in the program. Workers below 20 years of age may be paid $4.25 per hour by federal law, until they pass the three-month probationary period, after which the employer must convert their pay structure to the federal minimum wage rate. Finally, workers with physical or mental disabilities can be paid less than the federal minimum wage according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Disabilities which can affect production capacity include blindness, cerebral palsy, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and developmental disabilities. There is a high elasticity of demand for low-skilled labor. This means that a small change in the price for low-skilled labor tends to have a large effect on its demand. For these reasons, too high a minimum wage can lead to increasing unemployment among the low-skilled. In modern times, the proliferation of improved technology also increases the marginal rate of technical substitution for low-skilled labor. When the cost of labor increases, companies find it increasingly profitable to switch to labor-replacing technology, such as the decision made by Wendy’s Co. in 2016 to introduce self-serve kiosks in response to higher minimum wage laws.

406,Everett Rosenfeld,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"Sen. John McCain's office said Monday evening that he would return to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. That follows the news last week that the Arizona Republican had been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Health-care reform is an issue of critical importance for Republicans, who have campaigned for years on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare. But despite control of the House, the Senate and the White House, the GOP has struggled to push through a replacement plan, repeatedly hitting legislative roadblocks from members of their own party. Republican action on the health care bill will also be important to the millions of Americans who receive their coverage through Obamacare. Beyond that, investors are closely watching the progress of health-care reform because the GOP explicitly chose to address the issue before it took on taxes. That is, every setback for the Obamacare overhaul is seen as delaying the party's broader fiscal agenda. ","Senator John McCain will return to Senate for health-care vote, his office says",0.836
407,Dan Mangan,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"Even an Obamacare plan won't cover this health-care headache. Senate Republicans on Thursday threw a curveball into the already complicated Obamacare repeal game when they introduced yet another amendment to their bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. The new version, posted on a Senate website, strips out the so-called Cruz amendment that would allow insurers to sell much-less-generous, and hence less expensive, individual health plans. But it is not clear that that amendment, crafted by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will remain out of the bill as Senate Republican leaders continue to struggle for a vote on legislation that would undo much or all of Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office, in an analysis of the new version of the bill, estimated Thursday that it would lead to 22 million more Americans lacking health insurance by 2026 than would be uninsured if Obamacare remained in its current form. Fifteen million more people would become uninsured by next year, and then there would be 19 million more uninsured by 2020, CBO said. Those projections for the number of uninsured people are identical to estimates the CBO made for the first version of the bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act, and come as GOP leaders in the Senate have become increasingly desperate to pass some kind of health-care reform. The CBO also found similar effects from the new bill on insurance premiums, which are projected to end up in 2020 being 30 percent lower for individual health plans than would be the case under current Obamacare law. However, as in the original bill, the insurance plans expected to be sold then would cover a smaller share of the total cost of health benefits than under Obamacare now. And before 2020, average premiums for key Obamacare plans are expected next year to spike 20 percent higher than under the current law, and 10 percent higher in 2019 if the bill is passed into law. However, the new version is projected to lead to $420 billion in savings to the federal budget deficit, almost $100 billion more in savings than estimated by the CBO for the first bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has so far failed in his effort to corral the 50 votes necessary to pass a health-care reform bill, of any kind. McConnell cannot even muster enough Republican senators to support a procedural motion that would allow the bill to head toward a final vote. But he nonetheless plans to try to do so next week. The CBO's report is the second projection related to Obamacare released by the nonpartisan agency within a 24-hour period. On Wednesday, the CBO issued a report that estimated the effects of another Senate bill, which would repeal most of Obamacare without immediately replacing it with a new health-care law. That report said such a repeal by 2026 would increase the number of people without health insurance by 32 million people above the number that would be uninsured if the current law remained in place. The repeal bill also would double insurance premiums in the individual plan market and leave up to three-quarters of the United States without an insurer selling such plans by 2026. An earlier CBO analysis of an Obamacare replacement bill passed by the House found that 23 million more people would be uninsured if that bill became law. The Protect Our Care Campaign, a leading Obamacare defense group, criticized Republicans for continuing to try to pass a new health-care law. ""It doesn't matter what version of health care repeal Republicans put forward, they've each proven to be completely devastating for the American people — cutting coverage, raising costs, gutting Medicaid and weakening protections — just to give the wealthy and drug and pharmaceutical companies another tax break,"" the campaign said in an emailed statement. ""The newly-released CBO report on their latest health care repeal attempt proves it yet again — 22 million people lose coverage, premiums go up 20 percent and 26 percent is gutted from Medicaid while giving $541 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations,"" the campaign said. ""They keep promising it will get better but there is no way to fix repeal. It is always devastating,"" the group said. President Donald Trump earlier in the week called for a full repeal of Obamacare. On Wednesday, Trump pushed Senate Republicans to reach agreement on health-care legislation before leaving Washington for the August recess. ""We have to stay here. We shouldn't leave town, and we should hammer this out and get it done,"" Trump said. ",GOP throws another curveball into Obamacare repeal debate,0.9272
408, ,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"Sperm counts in men from America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand have dropped by more than 50 percent in less than 40 years, researchers said on Tuesday. They also said the rate of decline is not slowing. Both findings -- in a meta-analysis bringing together various studies -- pointed to a potential decline in male health and fertility. ""This study is an urgent wake-up call for researchers and health authorities around the world to investigate the causes of the sharp ongoing drop in sperm count,"" said Hagai Levine, who co-led the work at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine in Jerusalem. The analysis did not explore reasons for the decline, but researchers said falling sperm counts have previously been linked to various factors such as exposure to certain chemicals and pesticides, smoking, stress and obesity. This suggests measures of sperm quality may reflect the impact of modern living on male health and act as a ""canary in the coal mine"" signalling broader health risks, they said. Studies have reported declines in sperm count since the early 1990s, but many of those have been questioned because they did not account for potentially major confounding factors such as age, sexual activity and the types of men involved. Working with a team of researchers in the United States, Brazil, Denmark, Israel and Spain, Levine screened and brought together the findings of 185 sperm count studies from 1973 to 2011 and then conducted a so-called meta-regression analysis. The results, published in the journal Human Reproduction Update, showed a 52.4 percent decline in sperm concentration and a 59.3 percent decline in total sperm count among North American, European, Australian and New Zealand men. The former measures the concentration of semen in a man's ejaculation, while the latter is semen concentration multiplied by volume. In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa. The researches noted, however, that far fewer studies have been conducted in these regions. Experts asked to comment on the work said it was a comprehensive and well-conducted analysis and did a good job of adjusting for confounders that could have skewed its findings. Daniel Brison, a specialist in embryology and stem cell biology at Britain's Manchester University, said the findings had ""major implications not just for fertility but for male health and wider public health"". ""An unanswered question is whether the impact of whatever is causing declining sperm counts will be seen in future generations of children via epigenetic (gene modifications) or other mechanisms operating in sperm,"" he said in an emailed comment. Richard Sharpe at Edinburgh University added: ""Given that we still do not know what lifestyle, dietary or chemical exposures might have caused this decrease, research efforts to identify (them) need to be redoubled and to be non-presumptive as to cause.""

409, ,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"A secretive U.S. government panel has objected to at least nine acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign buyers so far this year, people familiar with the matter said, a historically high number that bodes poorly for China's overseas buying spree. The objections indicate that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, is becoming more risk-averse under President Donald Trump. Chinese companies and investors eyeing U.S. assets could face more roadblocks as a result, at a time when the Chinese government is also restricting the flow of capital out of China following a bonanza of Chinese overseas deals. There have been 87 announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese firms so far in 2017, the highest on record and up from 77 deals in the corresponding period in 2016. CFIUS's more conservative stance towards deals coincides with growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. On Wednesday the two countries failed to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Since the start of the year, CFIUS has sent letters to companies involved in at least nine deals to say they would be blocked based on measures they have proposed to address potential national security risks, the people familiar said. Many of these deals are in the technology sector, the sources said. A rise in cyber security threats and rapid advances in technology makes it more difficult to establish whether a deal poses any threat, lawyers who represent companies before CFIUS said. An initial objection by the watchdog does not necessarily kill the deal immediately. Some companies this year have chosen to keep their CFIUS filings alive by proposing new mitigation measures, while others have pulled their applications and canceled their deals, the people said. They asked not be identified because interactions between CFIUS and the companies are confidential. ""CFIUS decisions are highly sensitive and we are not going to comment on rumors of their outcome,"" a White House spokeswoman said. A spokesman at the Treasury Department declined to comment. Treasury leads CFIUS with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin serving as chairman. Most of the deals that CFIUS has sought to block this year have not been announced. Among the companies that have disclosed they have withdrawn their CFIUS applications and canceled their deals are U.S. electronics maker Inseego Corp, which tried to sell its MiFi mobile hotspot business to Chinese smartphone maker TCL Industries Holdings, and Texas oil producer ExL Petroleum Management LLC, which sought to sell its assets to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman's L1 Energy. By comparison, in the entirety of 2014, the last year for which CFIUS has released official data, nine deals were withdrawn after CFIUS began an investigation. Several more companies face protracted CFIUS reviews amid delays after Trump took office in filling important mid-level political positions at several of the 16 government departments and agencies that comprise CFIUS. CFIUS is on track to review a record-setting 250 to 300 transactions in 2017, according to Anne Salladin, a CFIUS expert with the law firm Stroock and Stroock and Lavan LLP - up sharply from 147 deals in 2014. The backlog is leading many companies that fail to gain CFIUS clearance within the standard 75 days allocated for review to refile their applications. Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues. A number of companies have said in regulatory filings that their high-profile deals are before CFIUS. They include Chinese payments company Ant Financial's $1.2 billion acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International and China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners' $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor. In addition, investment firm China Oceanwide Holdings Group's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial and China-based semiconductor investment fund Unic Capital Management's $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing equipment company Xcerra are also with the watchdog. Ant Financial has refiled its MoneyGram deal with CFIUS once, while Canyon Bridge and China Oceanwide have refiled their deals twice, according to company disclosures and Reuters reports. Unic is still on its first filing with CFIUS on its Xcerra deal, company disclosures and Reuters reports showed. Of the two dozen political appointee positions in the Treasury Department just three have been confirmed by U.S. lawmakers. A key CFIUS nomination is that of former Allen & Overy LLP lawyer Heath Tarbert, who has been appointed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international markets and development, and has yet to be confirmed. The U.S. is not alone in concerns about foreign dealmaking: Germany, for one, raised the bar on criteria for overseas acquirers seeking to snap up domestic targets in tech-heavy industries.

411,"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC.com",7272017,CNBC,7202017,"In a twist of fate, there is new hope for developing a vaccine to protect people from the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, a disease eluding the medical community that has now become a sex superbug. The vaccine, called MeNZB, was developed to control a meningitis epidemic in New Zealand from 2004 to 2006 and is no longer available. Researchers found that people vaccinated with the MeNZB were 31 percent less likely to get gonorrhea than those who weren't. In the study, 1 million people who had been diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia received the vaccine in a mass immunization program. Nearly 15,000 people were included in the analysis. It's not clear yet how long the immune response from this vaccine might last, but this is an important breakthrough. According to the World Health Organization, there are about 78 million new cases of this STD worldwide each year. Around 400,000 Americans were diagnosed with gonorrhea in 2015. Preventing infection in the first place seems to be the best option, ""and the most proven, reliable and cost-effective method of prevention would be the implementation of an effective vaccine,"" according to a 2016 study. Though the bacteria's biology makes it a particularly difficult adversary, scientists are optimistic about their prospects. Several hope to get a gonorrhea vaccine into clinical trials within the next decade. So far, mice have retained immunity for up to six months with this technique. Russell speculates that his lab could have a vaccine in clinical trials in the next five to 10 years, but there are some important questions to answer first. They want to better understand the mechanisms that make their vaccine successful, and make sure the immune response the technique elicits doesn't itself cause damage.

Fat freezing helps doctors enhance physiques, and their revenue Russell believes the work in his lab is the most mature and stands a good chance of being the first to the clinic. But to Gray-Owen, in practice the techniques would be complementary, perhaps providing immunity to different groups of people within the larger population. Once a vaccine becomes available, there might be hurdles in getting people to use it. One element might be the delivery method — Russell's treatment is administered vaginally in the mouse models, and he thinks that probably wouldn't be acceptable in humans, ""in part because it's not applicable in 50 percent of the population to start with,"" he says. There might be ethical issues to address, like if everyone should get it or only those at the highest risk, or if it's acceptable to put out a vaccine that only works on men or women but not both. Parents also might be wary of vaccinating kids against a sexually transmitted infection, as was the case with the HPV vaccine, Gray-Owen says. ""It might be difficult to convince parents that their young child should get a vaccine for gonorrhea. But as [the children] get older and start to realize the concern, if gonorrhea becomes untreatable or if the prevalence goes up in North America, I think that makes it not a crazy idea anymore,"" he says. Researchers in this field are overwhelmingly optimistic. Whereas their work might have seemed Sisyphean or irrelevant in the past, a successful vaccine seems closer at hand than ever. ""There are a lot of potential vaccine targets that have been identified, and we really need to get data from human trials as soon as possible. Given the high cost of clinical trial, it is likely that public–private partnerships will be required to drive development of a gonococcal vaccine,"" says Seib of Griffith University. ""I think it's going to be possible. I can't tell you exactly when it will be, but I think the findings that have emerged from our lab and elsewhere in recent years have made it likely to be feasible. There's been a lot of pessimism around for many years, but I think the tide is beginning to turn,"" Russell says. Given the current trend in gonorrhea infections and resistance, a vaccine like this could come just in time. The effectiveness of the flu shot wanes over time so it's best not to get it too early in the season, according to several recent studies. It takes 10 to 14 days to get the vaccine levels in your system so you are protected. Testosterone replacement therapy is gaining wider use, but there are potential health risks.

""There's no doubt we're in a trade war. We are losing that trade war. It is time to take action to support the American industry and the American people. And beyond just the steel industry, we're talking manufacturing as a whole,"" Ferriola told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Monday. ""Steel is the bedrock of manufacturing. Manufacturing is the bedrock of any strong economy."" Ferriola said that because foreign competitors are motivated not by profits, but by employment, those countries are effectively trying to ""export their unemployment"" to the United States steel industry, hurting companies doing business stateside. Moreover, if those competitors' low-cost imports continue to pressure U.S. steel producers that supply materials for everything from tractors to appliances, Ferriola said they would eventually engulf the whole U.S. market. ""There's no doubt, when you have predatory countries like China, as an example, they will take care of their own appliance [and] tractor industries in China before they worry about supplying steel to those American manufacturers here,"" the CEO said.

However, if the policy were passed, Ferriola said that Nucor and its peers would be able to unleash a whole new wave of improvements meant to boost business, which was slightly weak for Nucor, according to its second-quarter earnings report. ""If you look at the last six, seven years, we've invested over $7 billion growing our company, and we're doing that in an environment where we're not sure we have a sustainable industry,"" Ferriola told Cramer.

McCormick & Company Inc. (NYSE:MKC) recently announced it will acquire the food division of British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in a $4.2 billion deal that is expected to close later this year. Many products familiar to U.S. shoppers will join McCormick, including Frank's RedHot hot sauce, French's ketchup, French's mustard, and Cattleman's barbecue sauce. The deal will make McCormick the largest supplier of condiments in the United States. Image source: McCormick. Health, hygiene, and home products produced the lion's share of Reckitt Benckiser's more than $12 billion in 2016 revenue. Its food division was expected to provide $581 million in 2017 sales and the business has been growing in the mid-single digits, according to McCormick's management. The way McCormick CEO Lawrence Kurzius described it, Reckitt Benckiser's food division was a ""food asset trapped inside a nonfood company. ... For us, this is going to be a core business, and we're going to treat it accordingly."" McCormick believes it can give the acquired brands a friendlier base of operations as its $4.4 billion in 2016 revenue came entirely from food products. Management feels the company's expertise in the food business can result in increased sales due to more exposure to both the industrial segment of the market (which includes customers like restaurants), where McCormick sold 40% of its products,  and internationally, where McCormick sold 42% of its products in 2016. McCormick is a leader in spices and seasoning, with about 20% market share in the packaged retail spices and seasoning category of foods on a global basis. The key brand that drove McCormick to make the acquisition is Frank's RedHot Sauce, the product with the largest growth potential in the portfolio of brands that came with the acquisition. McCormick sees Frank's RedHot Sauce as a ""liquid spice"" that's very popular with millennials and has a runway for growth. ""... the hot sauce category and the Frank's RedHot brand, in particular, really drive the growth of the whole portfolio,"" said Kurzius. Management believes it can expand Frank's brand beyond the United States and Canada by increasing its presence in the Asian marketplace, where Western condiments have become quite popular, particularly for table-top usage in restaurants, not a distribution channel that current ownership has access to. McCormick management stated that their goal is to Make Frank's RedHot sauce the No. 1 global hot sauce brand. The company is also quite keen on French's mustard, the No. 1 brand in the U.S. and Canada. The price tag was $4.2 billion, which is over seven times the food division's estimated 2017 revenue of $581 million. The chart below shows McCormick's price to sales multiple over the past three years, which barely ever reached three. MKC PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts The price tag of $4.2 billion will be paid all in cash. McCormick will finance the deal in two ways. The company will work with lenders to borrow $3.7 billion. The other $500 million will come in the form of an equity offering of the company's stock. The company also announced, in light of the deal, it will suspend its share buyback program to conserve cash. Management reiterated that the company plans to continue issuing its quarterly dividend. The additional debt the company will take on will increase its borrowings from $804 million at the end of last quarter to a projected $4.5 billion when the deal closes. The company said it will update shareholders once the deal closes toward the end of this year. Until then, management will continue to focus on the current brands under the McCormick umbrella. The company sees French's products being its No. 2 brand and Frank's RedHot Sauce as its No. 3 brand, both of which will help McCormick move up from its current position as the No. 10 condiments supplier in the United States to No. 1 stateside and No. 3 on a global basis. This is a big investment for the company; the largest acquisition it has ever made. It is taking on a lot of debt to make the purchase. Time will tell if management is able to integrate the business, execute its plan, and reward shareholders with a higher stock price. ","

418,Martin Feldstein,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 26, 2017 4:24 p.m. ET Study shows enrollment drops may not harm patient heath, but could inflict financial pain By CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Project Syndicate) — Health-care reform is the major policy issue commanding attention in the United States. A crucial feature of the debate is the official estimate of the number of individuals who would lose their health insurance under the various plans that have been proposed to repeal and replace the existing Affordable Care Act (better known as “Obamacare”). The prospect that repealing Obamacare would cause more than 20 million people to lose their formal insurance coverage, as the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, is understandably a serious barrier to legislative progress. It is important, therefore, to understand just what that would mean in practice, and how much it would actually affect the health of those who lose their formal insurance. The primary reason for the loss of insurance in the proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare is the projected decline in Medicaid coverage. Medicaid is the joint federal-state health-care program in which the federal government defines who is eligible, stipulates which benefits must be provided, and finances those benefits based on a formula whereby states with low average incomes receive a larger share of federal funding. People who qualify for Medicaid do receive substantially more care than those without formal insurance — more doctor visits, prescriptions, hospital admissions, etc. They also have substantially lower out-of-pocket medical costs than the uninsured, including the elimination of “catastrophic” out-of-pocket costs. As a result, they are also much less likely to skip paying other bills because of medical debts or to have nonmedical bills sent to collection. If reform legislation reduces Medicaid benefits, the individuals who lose benefits would continue to receive free care in outpatient departments, emergency rooms, and as hospital in-patients. In general, this is paid for by the states through their “free care” programs. And individuals who are billed for services understand that providers generally do not attempt to collect from low-income patients. Moreover, those who are no longer in the Medicaid program do not lose care from the many doctors who now refuse to serve Medicaid patients because of the low fees allowed in the program. The most important fact to bear in mind is that enrollees in Medicaid show no significant improvement in clinical physical health outcomes. This was the main finding of a large “natural experiment” supported by the federal government. The experiment occurred when the state of Oregon opened enrollment to Medicaid in 2008, after the opportunity had been closed for many years. Because the state did not have enough funds to accept all 90,000 individuals who wanted to enroll, it conducted a lottery to select about 30,000 individuals who were given the opportunity to apply for Medicaid. A federally financed research team of physicians and health-care economists examined hospital records and other clinical information and also spoke with the enrollees and with those not admitted. The researchers concluded that self-reported overall health and depression improved among those who enrolled in Medicaid, and that there was an increase in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes for this group. But there was no significant improvement in clinical physical outcomes for conditions including hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Although the evidence indicates that the proposed cutbacks in federal dollars for Medicaid would not harm the physical health of those who lost their coverage, the reduction would force states to increase spending on their free-care programs. The cuts would also increase the costs to hospitals that provide care that is not reimbursed. It is not surprising that the prospect of adding these costs for tens of millions of patients to states’ budgets and to hospital costs causes state governors and hospital administrators to protest when Congress proposes cutting back on the Medicaid program. But it is important for the public and members of Congress to understand the real reason for their opposition.

419,Mengjie (Jessie) Jiang,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 20, 2017 2:58 p.m. ET By WASHINGTON — Negotiations for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement should give President Donald Trump “a victory,” but not at the expense of Mexico and Canada, Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton said Thursday. MacNaughton, speaking at a forum sponsored by the Washington International Trade Association, acknowledged the necessity to revamp the 23-year-old accord given the transformation of businesses, but emphasized a successful revamp should be flexible and “do no harm.” Mexican Ambassador Gerónimo Gutiérrez agreed, saying said Mexico has benefited tremendously from the three-nation trade pact and is looking for a “win-win-win” solution. The Trump administration said Monday its top priority for the talks was to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. In an 18-page summary of objectives, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he would work to reduce the trade imbalance by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico. Gutiérrez said the overarching objective would not be simply U.S. trade deficit reduction -- the three governments are interested in creating more and better jobs. “We have to move away from talking about the macroeconomic impacts of NAFTA, and emphasize the local impact on people,” said Gutiérrez. “We must listen to what people have to say. I think there are people in America who feel left out from benefits of Nafta.” Gutiérrez noted that Mexico proposed an anticorruption addition to Nafta. The newly released U.S. objectives include renegotiating intellectual property rights, stricter labor laws, enhanced environmental laws and tougher rules on the origin of products. The U.S. also reportedly wants to get rid of a system under Nafta that prevents the U.S. from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexico and Canada. “It makes sense to have a dispute resolution mechanism,” said MacNaughton. “We have to find ways where President Trump can claim victory without it being a loss to Canada or Mexico.” The first round of talks will take place Aug.16 to Aug.20 in Washington, Lighthizer’s office said in a statement Wednesday. Officials from the three countries plan to hold seven round of talks at three-week intervals to finish the Nafta renegotiation rapidly. Lighthizer has said he hopes the negotiations could be wrapped up by the end of the year, which he called a “very, very quick” time frame, but added that “we’re not going to have a bad agreement to save time.” When Nafta was created in 1994, the U.S. ran a small trade surplus with Mexico and Canada. In 2016, the United States had a nearly $11 billion trade deficit in goods with Canada and a $64 billion gap with Mexico. Trump called the trade agreement “the worse trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere” and threatened to pull out if he can’t push the trilateral trade accord to the best interest of the U.S. “I think people don’t understand how close we were [to withdrawal from Nafta],” said Gutiérrez. “Every political actor in the United States who understands the importance of Nafta needs to be vocal about it.” ",What Mexico and Canada want from the Nafta renegotiation - MarketWatch,0.9938

The earnings seemed to offset comments from President Donald Trump on Tuesday that signaled a possible change of heart on a plan to impose additional tariffs and restrictions on cheap steel imports. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said “we don’t want to do it at this moment.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been working on a seldom-used Section 232 investigation to determine whether steel imports are harming U.S. national security. Ross had intended to complete the report by the end of June, but the effort was braked because of objections from trading partners and some of Trump’s aides. Trump told the paper the issue was still on the table, and reiterated his view that dumping is “a very unfair situation.” But he said a final decision may have to wait until other stalled initiatives, including health-care reform and tax reform and even infrastructure, are completed. Read the WSJ interview here. The comments sent other steel stocks into a downward spiral.

Under Burrit’s leadership, the company posted net income of $261 million for the second quarter, or $1.48 a share, after a loss of $180 million, or $1.03 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to $3.14 billion from $2.73 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 36 cents a share on revenue of $2.98 billion. U.S. Steel expects full-year earnings of $1.70 a share, while analysts estimate earnings of 84 cents a share. J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Gambardella said the beat was driven by flat rolled realized prices and costs. Flat steel products are used in the automotive, domestic appliance, shipbuilding and construction industries. “Costs were lower due to the benefits from the restart of the Keetac facility and typical seasonal improvements in the mining operations,” he wrote in a note ahead of the company’s earnings call. “Tubular posted a smaller than expected loss with higher shipments and average selling prices as well as lower costs.” Gambardella said he expected Section 232 to be a key topic on the Wednesday earnings call. CEO Burritt said he was confident the Trump administration ‘would come to the right conclusion.” “In order to have a strong U.S. manufacturing base, we must have a strong steel industry,” he told analysts. “ So goes our manufacturing base, so goes our country and we firmly believe that this administration understand the importance U.S. deal to this country.” U.S. Steel shares have fallen 39% in 2017, while the S&P 500

422,MarketWatch,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 26, 2017 6:45 p.m. ET By Foxconn, a global electronics manufacturer best known for building Apple’s iPhones, will open a new factory in southeastern Wisconsin that the company says will initially employ 3,000, a figure that could eventually grow to 13,000 jobs. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s office said the plant represents a $10 billion investment, “the largest new greenfield investment made by a foreign-based company in U.S. history.” Foxconn CEO Terry Gou announced plans for the new facility in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House attended by President Donald Trump, Wisconsin’s Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who represents the district in which the plant will be constructed, and Walker. “I would see Terry, and I would say ‘Terry, you have to give us one of these massive places you do great work with,’” Trump said, later telling Gou “the American worker will not let you down.” Employees at the new facility will manufacture state-of-the-art liquid crystal display screens which will be used in everything from self-driving cars to aircraft systems and in the fields of education, entertainment, health care, safety and surveillance, advanced manufacturing systems, and office automation, among others, Walker’s announcement said. “We are thrilled to build a state-of-the art display fabrication plant in America’s heartland, which will be the first of a series of facilities we are building in several U.S. states as part of a robust 8K+5G ecosystem in the United States,” Gou said. Gou said the U.S. does not currently have the capabilities “to produce a complete 8K system,” referring to the highest high definition television resolution. “We are going to change that and it starts today with this investment in Wisconsin,” Gou said. Foxconn first established operations in the United States in 1988 and has facilities and offices in Alabama, California, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. Their operations include manufacturing, assembly and R&D facilities, as well as offices which are involved in sourcing from U.S. supply chain partners, product servicing and manufacturing sales. The company, which has been the subject of protests in the past over working conditions at its facilities, also has operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America.

423,MarketWatch,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Analysis  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events Early Saturday morning, President Trump declared via tweet that “all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon.” It will come as little shock that many do not agree on this point, especially when it comes to the question of whether the president can pardon himself. In fact, a new wing of the Internet has been opened to debate this point. The pardon power is exceptionally broad It is true that the pardon power is, indeed, one of the strongest unilateral authorities of the presidency. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution says that the president “shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” That language carves out two quick exceptions to the notion of “complete” pardon power. Presidential pardons cannot derail or overrule the impeachment process. And they can be used only for federal crimes, not for crimes that violate state law. But those are relatively small limitations. Most presidential powers come with an asterisk of sorts. Appointees require Senate confirmation, for instance; vetoes can be overridden. The pardon power does not. Justice Stephen Field, writing for the Supreme Court in the 1866 case Ex parte Garland (not Merrick), held that the pardon power was, except as already noted, “unlimited. … It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission.” Thus pardons can indeed be issued even before someone is formally charged with an offense. And the pardon “cannot be fettered by any legislative restrictions.” Pardons can be individually merciful Field also called the power “the benign prerogative of mercy,” highlighting one of the reasons for its existence. Seen this way, the power is a check against judicial overreach, against a miscarriage of justice, available as an act of compassion. For instance, past presidents routinely commuted the sentences of elderly prisoners at death’s door (or said to be. William Howard Taft wrote in his memoir about two of his commutations along these lines: “One man died and kept his contract. The other recovered at once, and seems to be as healthy and active as anyone I know.”) Without the pardon option, Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 74, “justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.” Pardons can be granted in the public interest But as Jeffrey Crouch’s 2009 book about the pardon power notes, “mercy” is not the whole story: The other traditional rationale for including the power in the Constitution is as a tool to serve a broader public interest. Hamilton covered this, too, with the example of a “well-timed offer of pardon” to insurgents that “may restore the tranquillity of the commonwealth.” George Washington used the power in this manner when in 1795 he set aside the death sentences of two ringleaders of the Whiskey Rebellion. In a rather different application, Thomas Jefferson pardoned all those convicted under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Both Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson issued proclamations of amnesty relating to the Civil War. Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to more than 200,000 men charged with evading the Vietnam draft. And much more recently, in lieu of hoped-for legislation on criminal sentencing reform, Barack Obama used his clemency powers to shorten more than 1,700 prison terms he thought were harshly skewed by mandatory minimum sentences that punished nonviolent crimes. Sometimes, of course, presidents use the “public interest” rationale to pardon specific people rather than groups. In late 1921, for instance, Warren Harding commuted the prison sentence of Socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, who had been convicted of violating the Espionage Act by criticizing the U.S. government during World War I. And in September 1974, in what Crouch calls “the most notorious pardon in U.S. history,” Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, who had resigned the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Ford explained that “the tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost” by what could be a years-long prosecution of the former president. [What can Watergate teach us about the Trump White House?] Over time, many came to agree with Ford’s rationale. But the pardon had huge political consequences across several years. Ford’s approval rating rapidly dropped from above 70 percent to below 50 percent. His press secretary resigned in protest. The suspicion that he may have cut a deal with Nixon (with the latter agreeing to resign, if pardoned) prompted Ford to become the first sitting president in more than a century to travel to Capitol Hill to testify before a congressional committee. Republicans lost nearly 50 House seats in the 1974 midterm election and Ford lost his bid for election in 1976. And pardons can be very controversial Thus, although the word “amnesty” comes from the same root as “amnesia,” people don’t tend to forget even the perceived misuse of the pardon power — that is, applied for neither reasons of mercy nor public policy, but rather out of self-interest. A long sequence of presidents have discovered this — as political scientist P.S. Ruckman notes, “Every generation of Americans has seen its controversial pardon … or nine.” In recent administrations, George H.W. Bush’s lame-duck pardon of six officials caught up in the Iran-contra scandal prompted accusations that Bush was seeking to conceal his involvement in the matter. George W. Bush spared I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby a 30-month jail sentence after Libby was convicted of perjury charges related to the leak of a CIA officer’s identity. (Bush, however, declined to grant a full pardon, angering Libby’s immediate boss, Vice President Richard B. Cheney.) Bill Clinton granted clemency to 176 people just two hours before leaving office in 2001. Among them were his half brother, Roger Clinton, (for a 1985 drug conviction) and, most controversially, Marc Rich and Pincus Green, who had fled to Switzerland after a 1983 indictment for tax evasion. That decision was further tainted by the fact that Rich’s ex-wife had given close to half a million dollars to the Clinton presidential library fund (and more than $1 million to Democratic candidates since 1993.) If a president is ‘himself a party to the guilt, he can be impeached and prosecuted.’ The category of self-serving pardons brings us back to the present day. Objections to the pardon power at the constitutional convention centered on the fear that a president guilty of treason would use it to shield his accomplices from punishment. But, James Wilson assured his fellow delegates, if the president “be himself a party to the guilt he can be impeached and prosecuted.” Whether that implies the president cannot pardon himself, or simply that the framers could not conceive Americans electing a president who would need to, remains a question. As the links at the top of this post highlight, there is no consensus on the legality of such an act. By contrast, history suggests that the political implications are quite clear. Trump may find out that something can be both legal and, simultaneously, an impeachable offense. [So what exactly counts as an impeachable offense?] ",Here’s what you need to know about the presidential power to pardon - The Washington Post,0.8806
424,John Coumarianos,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 24, 2017 3:36 p.m. ET Investors in Russia deal with uncertainty and shadowy companies By Russia’s stock market sure looks cheap, trading at a CAPE ratio (price relative to its past decade’s worth of average real earnings) of 4.9. By contrast, U.S. stocks trade at a 30 CAPE. If you were investing strictly on the numbers, you’d certainly consider putting long-term money in Russian stocks right now. Of course, a moment’s reflection regarding Russia reveals why you might think twice about investing strictly on the numbers. Former hedge fund manager Bill Browder’s thriller of a memoir, “Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man’s Fight for Justice,” published in 2015, suggests why investors are so down on Russian stocks. It may also offer clues into the Trump-Russia saga. Browder, founder of Hermitage Capital Management, was among the first Western investors in Russia when communism fell. With the backing of influential financier Edmond Safra, he bought Russian stocks trading at ridiculously low prices. As Browder tells it, vouchers that the Russian government gave citizens as claims on businesses shifting from government-run to privately owned traded at prices that valued all of Russian industry at just $20 billion. Browder estimates that Gazprom

                                    which itself has a current market capitalization approaching $350 billion. After the turbulent transition from the Soviet Union to Boris Yeltsin’s Russia, and the suspicious acquisition by various oligarchs of large swaths of Russia’s industry, Browder viewed President Vladimir Putin favorably; perhaps Putin could clean up the corruption. It turned out that Putin did take on the original oligarchs, but, according to Browder, also seized large pieces of Russian industry for himself and his cronies. Putin led a group that, in Browder’s opinion, became the new oligarchs or kleptocrats. Browder did a kind of forensic accounting and ownership analysis of various Russian businesses, and surmised that government officials had stolen or re-titled 10% of Gazprom’s assets. Browder became an activist shareholder, was deemed a threat to Russian national security in 2006, and no longer permitted to enter the country. His attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, was charged with a $290 million tax fraud that he and Browder had originally uncovered on the part of others, and was imprisoned for almost a year. Magnitsky died during his pre-trial detention, likely from being denied medical treatment. With his hedge fund now closed, Browder spent the next few years lobbying Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act, prohibiting those responsible for Magnitsky’s death from entering the United States and gaining access to the U.S. banking system. The law was signed by former President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012. A reportedly infuriated Putin retaliated by banning the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens, and also by banning certain U.S. citizens from Russia, including former U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. President Trump fired Bharara soon after taking office. That’s why it’s plausible Russia sought to discuss both adoptions and the Magnitsky Act, at the June 2016 meeting between a Russian delegation and representatives of the Trump campaign, as the Washington Post’s Anne Applebaum has suggested. Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who attended the meeting, has advocated against the Magnitsky Act, including keeping Magnitsky’s name off the law. She also represented former vice governor of the Moscow region Pyotr Katsyv’s son, Denis, whom Bharara charged with laundering money in Manhattan real estate stolen from Browder’s fund. Against such a backdrop, investors, suspecting fraud and theft, have been wary of Russian stocks. Indeed, Russia’s market has traded at single-digit multiples for years. Russian companies pose more than the ordinary uncertainty investors face around future asset values and earnings. Investors should understand that when you buy Russian stocks, it’s hard to know what — or who — will support or derail your investment. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

                                   , and the European economy, was dire, with plenty of forecasters predicting it would soon be down to parity with the dollar. It hasn’t quite worked out like that. Instead, Europe looks more politically united than it has in the past decade, and the economy is witnessing a cyclical upswing which, with any luck, may turn into a durable recovery. In fact, the issue now is that the euro is too strong — not that it is too weak. But hold on. There is a problem with investors’ sudden love affair with the euro, and one they need to wake up to fast. They are reckoning without European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. In fact, a strengthening euro is absolutely the last things he needs as he kindles the fragile flames of an economic recovery. Can he send it back down again? Sure he can. And traders would be foolish to try and fight him. Over the last month, the euro has started to power ahead on the currency markets. At the start of this year, it was down to $1.04 against the dollar, and with difficult elections scheduled in France and the Netherlands it was not hard to see it going to parity or even below. And now? Over the last few months, it has steadily climbed to $1.16, and it is still going up. In the last three months alone, it has put on more than 6%. In the markets, bullish bets on the currency have hit their highest level in more than a year, according to an analysis by Rabobank.  A $1.20 rate looks like an easy target – and $1.30 may be possible by the autumn. It is not likely to hit the $1.59 it peaked at back in 2008, but there is no reason why it can’t keep climbing. It is not hard to understand why the euro is suddenly strong again. With the victory of President Emmanuel Macron in France, the continent looks a lot more stable. Not only does he have a huge mandate, but if he can push through reforms to the way the currency works, he can take the risk of a break-up splintering off the table. The ECB’s €2.2 trillion of quantitative easing has finally started to feed through into higher growth figures. Only this week, the International Monetary Fund upgraded its 2017 forecasts for most of the zone’s major economies — Germany by 0.1%, France by 0.2%, and Spain and Italy by 0.5%. Indeed, with a 3.1% expansion forecast for this year, Spain will have one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. At the same time, with Donald Trump’s presidency looking more and more chaotic, the dollar

                                   is far less attractive than it was. The euro is a far better home for spare cash than most of the major alternatives. The trouble is, a stronger currency is the last thing Europe needs right now. Exports are the foundation of most of the major European economies, and as the currency gets stronger they will inevitably get hit. In peripheral Europe, where exports are based on price more than anything else, and where the recovery is most needed, they will be hit especially hard. Indeed, stock markets across the continent have already started to suffer as investors figure out that the currency will hurt company profits and then jobs as well. The recovery needs to put down deep roots to repair the damage of the last decade — but a strong euro will stop that. So what could Draghi do to turn that around? True, managing the foreign-exchange markets is an impossible task. But that does not mean he is completely powerless to influence the direction of the currency. First, he could extend QE. With the economy recovering, and with the threat of outright deflation banished at least for now, there is lots of speculation that the ECB will start tapering its program of printing fresh money. In fact, that is one reason why the euro has been climbing. So far, Draghi himself has been fairly neutral on the issue, giving few clues one way or the other. But a strongly worded statement extending the scale and duration of QE would quickly have the trading desks unwinding all those bullish euro bets. Next, change the asset mix. One reason there has been so much speculation about tapering QE is because the ECB may soon run out of government bonds it is allowed to hold. So buy something else. A powerful move into buying equities directly, or even an experiment with — and send the currency hurtling back down again. Three, line up a dove as the next president. Draghi’s term does not end until 2019 but there is already jockeying to succeed him. The assumption is that a German will get the job next time. After all, it is their turn — and that means a stern Bundesbank hardliner. But making it clear it is likely to be a dove from peripheral Europe — Ireland’s Philip Lane is one possible candidate — would send a powerful signal the ECB is not going to change course. In his six years in the presidency, Draghi has proved himself a smart operator. When the history books are written, he may well go down as the man who saved the euro, and with it the European project. He surely knows, however, that a stronger euro is the one thing that could prevent his recovery lasting, especially in peripheral, Southern Europe where it is most needed. At some point, he will decide to bring the currency under control — and you won’t want to be on the other side of that trade when it happens. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

427, ,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Supported by By Stanley Reed When major oil producers met in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday, the talk was tough. Officials hoped to show they were following through on plans to cut production and, in turn, bolster prices. The oil minister of Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest exporter, even cut short his summer vacation to attend. The result? Meh. Markets appear to have shrugged off a raft of announcements meant to address concerns that production cuts agreed upon last year are failing to achieve their goal of soaking up excess oil supply and pushing prices higher. “Did Saudi pull a rabbit out of the hat?” wrote Helima Croft, an oil analyst at the investment bank RBC Capital Markets. “No.” The meeting on Monday brought together the 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and several other major producers, including Russia and Oman. In a statement after the meeting, the group seemed content with mildly tough talk, chastising (unidentified) countries for failing to follow through with promised cuts to output. “There is still room for improvement by some participating producing countries,” the group said. “All participating producing countries must promptly reach full conformity.” Those comments appeared to target, among other nations, Iraq, a major OPEC producer that is producing well above its quota. But it is not clear how easy it will be for the Saudis and others to bring the war-torn country, which desperately needs revenue to address an array of problems, in line. The meeting also did little to fix the problem of rapid production increases by Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from the cuts. Nigeria did agree to carry out some “adjustments,” but only once its sustained output reaches 1.8 million barrels a day. (It is currently well below that level.) Saudi Arabia said it would cut exports to 6.6 million barrels a day for August, about 700,000 barrels below the levels of a year ago. Analysts said that move represented yet another attempt to influence markets, especially in the United States, a highly visible destination for Saudi crude. Summer is when Saudi Arabia typically diverts oil from exports toward domestic use, to help generate electricity for air-conditioning during the Arabian Peninsula’s searing heat. Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s. Taken together, the various moves helped push crude prices up about 1 percent on Monday, to more than $48.50 a barrel. But the relative lack of an effect on oil prices suggested that the agreement was not working, and the tough talk has raised concerns that unity in the group is fraying. And if this maneuvering has few lasting effects, the whole output-cutting exercise could start looking like a mistake. “I think the meeting revealed that there are some tensions starting to grow within the group,” said Robert McNally, president of the Rapidan Group, a market research firm. The oil producers’ group acknowledged that while it wants to cut excess supplies, they remain elevated. If that situation continues into November, when OPEC is scheduled to meet, those tensions could mount and jeopardize the whole effort, Mr. McNally said.

Prices continued to climb in electronic trading late Tuesday, topping $48 a barrel, after data from an industry group reportedly showed a hefty drop in weekly supplies for U.S. crude. Early Wednesday, oil prices were extending those gains. On Monday, Saudi Arabia said at a meeting in Russia that it would cut August exports to 6.6 million barrels a day—a million barrels less than a year earlier. Separately, Nigeria, which isn’t part of the production-cut agreement led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, also promised to limit its daily production to 1.8 million barrels. Traders have taken these developments as bullish for prices, though many do point out that the Saudis normally lower exports at this time of year because of stronger domestic demand for oil, and Nigeria’s output would still have to rise from its current level of just over 1.6 million barrels a day before the West African nation would cap its output. Still, at the meeting Monday, which include some major non-OPEC nations such as Russia, oil producers were upbeat. “OPEC and non-OPEC members displayed optimism over the current production cut deal and seemed confident that the path they were treading would eventually rebalance the markets,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in an note Tuesday. Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Monday the coalition’s compliance with the production deal was strong, while OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the rebalancing of oil-market supply and demand is “bound to accelerate in the second half,” according to The Wall Street Journal. On Tuesday, United Arab Emirates followed Saudi Arabia’s lead, with its energy minister Mohamed al-Mazrouei announcing on Twitter that the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company will cut its crude exports by about 10% in September. Adding further support to oil prices, James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics, pointed to “Halliburton’s expectation of a flat rig count” as well as “Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s losses and plans to reduce exploration.” After posting a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss, oil-and-gas exploration and production company Anadarko Petroleum Corp.

Meanwhile, traders are also looking ahead to a weekly report that is expected to reveal a fourth-straight weekly decline in U.S. crude inventories. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect the Energy Information Administration to report on Wednesday a decline of 2.5 million barrels for crude stockpiles in the week ended July 21. “U.S. oil stocks, while still higher than we need, are down 45 million barrels from the end of March,” said Williams, citing EIA data.

429,Myra P. Saefong,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 26, 2017 8:31 a.m. ET NEW YORK, Jul 26, 2017 (PR Newswire Europe via COMTEX) -- NEW YORK, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mounting research from around the world suggests marijuana's potential to treat multiple medical conditions ranging from chronic pain to cancer, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, anxiety and more. Predicted to reach $55.8 billion by 20251, the global medical marijuana industry presents to investors a wide array of investment opportunities, driven by increasing demand for therapeutic applications of the drug. In turn, funds raised through the public market give marijuana companies the chance to raise capital to build stronger portfolios, increase their market reach and revenue, and offer cannabis-based alternatives to traditional medicine. Companies such as ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. , Medical Marijuana, Inc. , CV Sciences, Inc. , Terra Tech Corp. , and Marijuana Company of America, Inc. are operating in the medical marijuana scene and are steadily building a strong reputation as leading providers of cannabis-based health and wellness products and services. Created as a premier source of financial information for Chinese-speaking investors, ChineseInvestors.com [https://www.networknewswire.com/clients/chineseinvestors-com-ciix/?symbol=ciix ] (otcqb:CIIX) is carving for itself a hefty portion of the cannabis market through diversified entry points. Adding to its current operations, CIIX earlier this week announced (http://nnw.fm/3nlZM) its entry into China's skincare industry though the impending launch of a new line of cannabidiol-based skincare products. ""Although ancient Chinese recognized the medicinal properties of the cannabis plant, CBD extract appears to be largely unrecognized in China today for its benefits, including but not limited to, its potential benefits to the largest visible human organ, the skin. The effects of increased air pollution on the human body are a growing concern for many in China. With regard to our skin, toxins in air pollution promote the production of free radicals, causing premature aging including coarse wrinkles and dark spots. However, some dermatologists believe that the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in CBD can potentially have anti-aging effects on the skin,"" the company stated in the press release. The opportunity here is significant, as you look at the broader market. China is currently the second largest consumer of skincare products, generating annual retail sales of more than $29.6 billion2. Research from ReportLinker estimates that Chinese skincare product retail sales will reach $36.3 billion this year. The CBD Magic Hemp Series, to be launched by early September by CIIX's wholly-owned CBD Biotechnology Co. Ltd. subsidiary (http://nnw.fm/VC7oZ), will position CIIX as a first mover in this previously untapped sector of the Chinese skincare industry. CIIX has filed a record of the product line with the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, and the company anticipates capturing, ""100% of China's market share in this novel skin care products category,"" since, to its knowledge, other manufacturers have not yet entered the cannabis skincare product market in China. Again targeting an untapped niche of the marijuana market, CIIX operates the first Chinese-language online store selling cannabidiol (CBD) products. In December 2016, CIIX launched www.ChineseCBDoil.com [https://www.networknewswire.com/?s=ChineseCBDoil ] in Shanghai, catering to a growing audience of Chinese people interested in the benefits of CBD-based products for the treatment of various medical conditions such as stress, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and others. In conjunction with the launch of the website, CIIX introduced the first Yelp-style social media app in Chinese. The app, approved by the Apple store, is a platform for reviews and discussions about cannabis products and provides a comprehensive database of dispensaries and marijuana strains, all in the Chinese language. CIIX is also getting ready to open its first retail store, primarily targeting the Chinese community in San Gabriel, California. The store will sell the company's new OptHemp product line, launched by subsidiary ChineseHempOil.com, Inc., to treat pain and inflammation. In July, CIIX announced (http://nnw.fm/6ThNn) that www.ChineseHempOil.com [https://www.networknewswire.com/?s=ChineseHempOil ] will accept bitcoin payments for its health products, food and beverages. Another recognizable marijuana company focused on market firsts is Medical Marijuana, Inc. . MJNA was the first publicly-traded marijuana company in the United States; the first to make cannabidiol available domestically and abroad; and the first to establish a global CBD pipeline that made beneficial cannabinoid products available to people all over the world. In addition to establishing an international CBD pipeline, providing support services to the cannabis industry and working to develop new markets, MJNA is focusing on the development and distribution of CBD hemp oil health products such as HempMeds(R) and Kannaway(R), in addition to developing cannabis medication via subsidiaries AXIM Biotechnologies, Kannalife(TM) Sciences, and HempMeds(R). The companies are looking into different delivery methods for marijuana-based therapies and are targeting a wide range of conditions including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, chronic pain and more. Medical marijuana player CV Sciences (otcqb:CVSI) operates its corner of the market via two different business segments: pharmaceuticals and consumer products. Its pharmaceutical division is developing synthetic CBD-based medicines for various medical conditions, with approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its pipeline currently includes a CBD-based product designed to support cessation of tobacco addiction. The consumer products division manufactures and distributes plant-based CBD products designed to enhance quality of life. CVSI's flagship consumer products, PlusCBD Oil and Purified Liquids vaping blends, are already distributed nationwide via health care providers, health food stores and online. Terra Tech (otcqx:TRTC) is a vertically-integrated cannabis agriculture company that owns multiple subsidiaries in the medical marijuana space. One of these subsidiaries is Bluem(TM), a retail medical cannabis company that provides medical cannabis as an alternative treatment for patients with chronic conditions. Also offering cannabis to the adult-use market in Nevada, where the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes is legal, Bluem offers recreational and medicinal consumer products such as flowers and concentrates produced according to the highest standards of potency and purity. Terra Tech is committed to cultivating only high-quality medical marijuana and providing it to qualified and registered medical marijuana establishments throughout the United States. At the same time, the company is continuing research to cultivate and cross-breed medical marijuana strains for the treatment of many different medical conditions. As demand for medical marijuana grows, so does the need for grow space. Marijuana Company of America is primarily focused on the marketing and distribution of hemp via a diverse portfolio of companies, brands, joint ventures and investments such as hempSMART, Club Harmoneous, GateC Research, Bougainville and MoneyTrac Technology. The company earlier this month said it has received financing that it will use to develop a state-of-the-art 30,000-square-foot greenhouse grow facility in Oroville, Washington, with joint-venture partner Bougainville Ventures, Inc. At full capacity, the facility is expected to accommodate cannabis production and processing of its tenant, a Tier 3, I-502 licensed grower. MCOA said it plans to replicate this business model to build its real estate portfolio and increase revenues. These public companies, expanding their market reach and brand recognition in their respective niches of the medical marijuana market, provide ample opportunities for investors looking for an entrance into the booming medical marijuana market. Proponents of marijuana for medical purposes point to a growing number of studies that confirm the health benefits of cannabis, setting the industry on track to continue its strong performance and become a key industry and engine of economic growth.

430,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"(Reuters) - Mediware Information Systems Inc [MEDWI.UL], a healthcare technology company owned by private equity firm TPG Capital LP, has hired Bill Miller to lead the company as it looks to build out its presence in post-acute care and human services, the company said on Thursday. Miller was previously the chief executive officer of OptumInsight, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group Inc, the world’s largest healthcare services company. He will replace Kelly Mann, who has been CEO of Mediware since 2007. “I am excited about their strong position in the expanding markets they serve, and look forward to working with TPG and the Mediware team to build on the momentum that the company has achieved to-date,” Miller said in a statement. TPG Capital completed its acquisition of Mediware from buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. Mediware sells software programs that help with administration and costs savings to healthcare providers including blood banks, behavioral health providers, home healthcare providers and more. It is poised to grow significantly in the coming years, as healthcare providers aim to cut costs through the use of new technologies and increasingly rely on outpatient care centers rather than traditional hospitals. As chief executive of Mediware, Miller told Reuters he plans on pursuing a balanced growth strategy across its various areas of focus, ranging from human services to home health and more. He added that he Mediware will rely on a blend of organic growth and acquisitions. Earlier this year, Mediware acquired Kinnser Software, which provides software for home health and hospice providers. Thoma Bravo took Mediware private in 2012 for $195 million and built it out with acquisitions including Bowman Systems, which focuses on homeless management. TPG has previously invested in other healthcare technology companies including Evolent Health and IMS Health. ","

431,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed over the 22,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday, but investor fears about the sustainability of the gains took the shine off the round number milestone. The rally lost momentum during the day’s trading and despite the recent run up, helped by strong earnings from Apple Inc and Boeing Co, some technical indicators were flashing warning signs. “The market gain has been built on a narrow group of issues. That typically is not indicative of great health,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I would not be shocked ... if we saw a pullback.” And with the Dow industrials at a record high, Dow theory suggests that the Dow Transportation Average index should also hit a record in order to confirm the market’s march higher. But that index trails the Dow industrials’ year-to-date performance by almost 10 percentage points and is nearly 6 percent below its own July 14 record high. Also, overall market breadth, or the number of winning stocks relative to losers, is weakening even as the major U.S. indexes hover near record highs. That means the broad gains have been driven by advances in a declining number of companies, and market watchers fear they could be hard to sustain. The number of 52-week lows among NYSE- and Nasdaq-traded stocks is at its highest since late June while the number of 52-week highs has dropped sharply since mid-July. (For a graphic on 'U.S. stock market breadth' click reut.rs/2hnL4Ob) Apple, McDonald’s Corp and UnitedHealth Group Inc have each added more than 200 points to the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning names like Apple, with its $157 price tag, and Boeing, which closed Wednesday near $238 per share, will generally have more of an influence over the index than components like the roughly $25 per share General Electric Co. The lack of breadth as well as the underperformance by the Dow transports could be a signal that the market rally could be sputtering out, at least for now. Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS in New York, said the weakness of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday versus the strength of Apple shares showed an “underlying fatigue in the rally.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite traded flat on Wednesday, even as Apple jumped nearly 5 percent. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Dow milestone was “a remarkable thing for investors ... but at the same time, this could also be a trap if the momentum does not follow.” The more than eight-year-old bull market in U.S. stocks got a second wind after last year’s election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, on expectations that his business-friendly policies including tax cuts and deregulation would boost corporate gains and economic growth. But tax cuts and other parts of the Trump agenda have not materialized, leaving earnings growth as the real engine of the market. “Earnings growth allows the market to be patient about Washington. It allows the market to be patient about fiscal reform,” said Steven Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, who said they would “be buyers on any weakness.” Fundamentals remain strong. With 350 of 500 companies’ reports in, the S&P 500 index is on track to post back-to-back double-digit quarterly earnings growth for the first time in almost six years. Still, the market is expensive by historical standards. Investors are paying $18 for every $1 in expected S&P 500 earnings over the next 12 months, near the highest since 2004 and above the long-term price-to-earnings average multiple of 15. “The market isn’t without issues as it relates to valuations which are full if not somewhat expensive,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. He expects the Dow to go beyond 22,000, however. There is also summer seasonality to take into account. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital in London, said the Dow’s run up past 22,000 was “indicative of a bull market speeding to a top.” “August is usually not a great month for stocks, up five times in the last 20, so there is caution about how long this can be sustained beyond earnings season euphoria,” Wilson said.

432,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"With John McCain’s dramatic “no” vote, the Health Care Freedom Act (HFCA) died early last Friday morning and with it any hope of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for the foreseeable future. While conservatives might prefer to blame incompetent vote-whipping in the Senate, the ACA could prove resilient for the same reason Medicare and Social Security have: most voters prefer not to wonder if they will be able to eat when hungry or see a doctor when sick. Any program that gives more economic security to a broad, politically powerful group will be dangerous to meddle with, even in these polarized times. Conservative activists and pundits who don’t want to contend with that reality may point to the president they were dealt: Donald Trump knew essentially nothing about health care and he alternated between disengagement and crude bullying of wavering senators ahead of the vote. Blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is less convincing. McConnell is a masterful legislative strategist and it took his maneuvering to bring a bill supported by less than 30 percent of the public to within one vote of passing. Indeed, McConnell may only have come even that close because he skipped the normal committee hearing process, protecting the proposal from more public and media scrutiny. The real lesson here is that once major social programs are in place, it’s simply very hard to eliminate them. In his 1994 book “Dismantling the Welfare State?”, the political scientist Paul Pierson showed that major social welfare programs were very resilient, and conservative attempts to repeal them generally failed. This was true even in parliamentary systems with fewer choke points to stop repeal than the American system. In the United States, the clearest example is Social Security. Before becoming president, Ronald Reagan had repeatedly expressed a desire to make it a voluntary program, but he quickly abandoned any thoughts of radically restructuring the program after taking office. Instead he oversaw a bipartisan plan to protect the program’s solvency through a combination of regressive tax increases and benefit cuts. When the Republican controlled-Senate narrowly passed a one-year freeze to seniors’ annual cost-of-living adjustment freeze during Reagan’s second term, the president abandoned the unpopular proposal, letting it die in the House of Representatives. George W. Bush, after winning re-election in 2004, made Social Security privatization his signature domestic issue. Bush travelled the country, making the case for a system of voluntary private accounts to partially replace Social Security for young workers. But the idea was politically toxic, actually becoming less popular the more Bush discussed it. Congressional Democrats, who had collaborated with Republicans on major domestic legislation during Bush’s first term, came out against the proposal en masse. Republicans controlled both houses of Congress but they refused to take responsibility for highly unpopular changes to a cherished program. No Social Security privatization bill came close to a vote. Republicans have not actively pursued the goal since. Nor have Republicans had any success at attacking the Great Society’s cornerstone health policy, Medicare. Sometimes they actively go in the opposite direction. In George W. Bush’s first term, Bush worked with Republicans to pass a corporate-friendly expansion of Medicare to partially cover payments for prescription drugs. Tea Party activists consider this one of the Bush era’s major betrayals of small government conservatism. But even arch-conservatives like Rick Santorum voted for the law. The politics were irrefutable: senior citizens vote, mostly Republican, and they fill a lot of prescriptions. In 2011, now-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposed a plan to convert Medicare into a system in which seniors received vouchers (whose value would decrease over time) to purchase health insurance on private markets. The proposal was extremely unpopular and created a major backlash. Ryan has never officially abandoned some form of vouchers as a goal, but he has not put any Medicare restructuring on his legislative agenda since taking the Speaker’s gavel. The Ryan budget’s threat to Medicare, however, proves a reliably spooky specter for Democrats to invoke when sending fundraising emails or appealing to older swing voters. Social programs are often not fully appreciated by their beneficiaries until someone proposes getting rid of them. Facing an existential threat made the Affordable Care Act much more popular – as then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi predicted, support for it increased once people found out what was in it. The Republican proposals to replace the ACA, conversely, are staggeringly unpopular. As recently as last year, more Americans disapproved of the ACA than supported it, but its approval ratings are now over 50 percent, while the repeal bills started out unpopular and became more so. The majority support for the ACA wasn’t soft, either. Supporters of the ACA were far more motivated than its opponents during the repeal struggle, putting their time and sometimes their bodies on the line, such as when disabled people were ejected from the offices of members of Congress. This helps to explain why moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (not to mention Democratic senators representing states that Trump won in landslides such as West Virginia and Montana) were unwavering in their opposition. The weekend after the HCFA was voted down, Murkowsi was repeatedly greeted by supporters, some in tears, thanking her for her no vote, while Nevada Senator Dean Heller was rewarded for his “yes” vote by seeing his approval rating plummet to 22 percent. This doesn’t mean that supporters of the ACA should be complacent. Even when Republicans have failed to eliminate major social programs, they have been able to make them less generous in ways that caused real harm, Reagan’s Social Security adjustment included. Trump is signaling that he will damage the ACA administratively, and 19 states are still refusing the ACA’s generous Medicaid expansion. Moreover, the failure to eliminate major welfare programs is a tendency, not an iron law. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a welfare “reform” bill that led to more than 6 million mothers with children losing welfare benefits. That was possible partly because welfare, unlike Obamacare, only benefits the poor, who are politically disempowered. Still, Republicans just came closer to passing a partial repeal of the ACA than many would have thought possible. The battle over healthcare is far from over, but the repeated failures of the GOP efforts to repeal it prove the political durability of the social safety net.

433,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"(Reuters Health) - Being overweight or obese as a teenager may increase a person’s risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult, suggests a large Israeli study. Long-term follow-up of 1.79 million Israeli men and women examined for military service as teenagers showed that overweight and obese teens were over 50 percent more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer by middle age, compared to normal-weight peers. “The findings from the study show evidence that being overweight and obese in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancer in both men and woman,” said Dr. Avni Desai, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study “Obesity was also noted to have an association with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Other smaller studies have shown a possible association with obesity and adolescence and future risk of colorectal cancer, but this is the largest study to show the association,” Desai said, adding that in past research the association has been stronger for men. For the study, published in the journal Cancer, Dr. Zohar Levi, a researcher at Rabin Medical Center and Tel Aviv University and his team analyzed data from millions of Israeli adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service from 1967 to 2010. The young men and women were between the ages of 16 and 19 at the time of the examinations, and Levi’s team used a national cancer registry to track who was diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer through December 2012. The average follow-up was 23 years and the researchers identified almost 2,967 new cases of colorectal cancer in the study group. Among men, there were 1,403 cases of colon cancer and 574 cases of rectal cancer, and among women, 764 colon cancers and 226 rectal cancers. Being overweight or obese at the initial military examination was associated with 53 percent and 54 percent higher risks of colon cancer for men and women, respectively, compared to normal-weight peers. In men, obesity was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of rectal cancer, and in women, being obese more than doubled that risk. Levi did not respond to a request for comments. This study does have some limitations, said Desai. “It is looking at a specific group, Israeli Jewish men and women, the studied group included predominantly men.  As such it is unclear if the results would be similar in the general U.S. population,” she said. Additionally, the researchers didn’t have information about adult body weights, so it is unclear whether obese or overweight teens stayed heavy or slim teens gained weight in adulthood. “The study could not assess whether risk of colorectal cancer was related to adult obesity independent of adolescent obesity,” Desai said. “Also, other risk factors that may affect risk of colorectal cancer such as family history, level of physical activity, diet, and smoking were not reported in the study. Family history is a risk factor for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, especially at a young age.” Desai noted that although the participants were followed for at least 10 years, they were still fairly young at the end of the study. “The median age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study was 49.4 years, which is younger than the average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer,” she said, adding that 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50. The average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the United States is age 72, she added. “Again, it is hard to pinpoint the exact causes of colorectal cancer in young patients, what we do know is a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing cancer.  This includes regular exercise, and a healthy diet, low in fat, high in fiber, with less red meats and processed meats,” she said. SOURCE: bit.ly/2tDgJgk Cancer, online July 24, 2017. ","

434,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen’s cholera outbreak is so widespread that just drinking water can lead to death. Nearly 2,000 people have already succumbed to one of the worst recorded outbreaks of cholera in modern history, with over 400,000 having contracted the disease, according to the World Health Organization. Cholera, a diarrheal disease spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen’s devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. With stinking green watery filth mingled with trash being a common sight in the capital Sanaa, the government is struggling to control the spread of the disease. Pumps to sanitize the water supply sit idle for lack of fuel, while maintenance agencies tasked with chlorinating aquifers go without salaries and supplies. Since Yemen’s government took control of central bank funds, it no longer pays most civil servants in Houthi-held lands. This means that most of those working in and around Sanaa have not been paid for six months, ruining the lives of hospital and sanitation workers. Meanwhile, the parched and mountainous country is in danger of running out of water, leaving its 28 million mostly impoverished citizens facing another crisis. A dearth of clean water has forced many residents to queue up and fill jerry cans from water trucks. The United Nations estimates that in Yemen a child under the age of five dies every 10 minutes from preventable causes, two million people have fled fighting near their homes and only half of hospitals have staff and supplies to function normally.

435,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) By Mark Miller CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are hovering around retirement age today, you will be closing in on your eighties in the year 2030. With any luck, you will be healthy and mobile - but imagine for a moment that you are not. Let’s say a debilitating illness requires that you receive care in a nursing home. It is an unsettling future to imagine. But now ask yourself this - who will take care of you? The United States is headed toward a severe shortage of caregivers - paid and unpaid - in the decades ahead, according to human resources expert Paul Osterman. A professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, Osterman is the author of a new book, “Who Will Care for Us: Long-term Care and the Long-Term Workforce” (Russell Sage Foundation, 2017), which examines trends in the labor force market for caregivers. His conclusion? “It’s an absolute train wreck waiting to happen.” Our aging population will push up demand, although Osterman notes that roughly half of demand for care will come from younger, disabled people. He examines the projected rising demand for care in the coming decades, and then matches up the demand side with trends in the labor force for paid certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and home care workers, including the availability of unpaid family and friends - the most common source of care for many people. He finds that in 2030 there will be a national shortage of 151,000 paid direct care workers and 3.8 million unpaid family caregivers. By 2040, the shortfall will be much larger: 355,000 paid workers, and the family and friends shortfall will be a shocking 11 million. “These are conservative estimates,” Osterman said in an interview. “They assume no changes in immigration policies, and that family members will be willing to provide care at the same rate they do today - that’s not likely, due to smaller families and more geographic dispersion.” If family caregivers become more scarce, that can only put further pressure on demand for paid care. The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in the United States will only worsen the situation. In 2015, 18 percent of CNAs and 27 percent of home care aides were immigrants, Osterman estimated, citing Census data. Among immigrant home aides, 24 percent each come from Central America and Asia, 23 percent come from the Caribbean and 10 percent are from Africa. But he cautions that the impact of a shrinking immigrant labor pool will be uneven, due to the huge variation in immigration patterns among the states. “New York and California have very large immigrant populations, but it would probably have very little impact in a state like Ohio,” he said. The highest percentages of home care aides who are immigrants are found in New York (64 percent), New Jersey (47 percent) California (46 percent), Florida (38 percent) and Texas (22 percent). By contrast, just 8 percent of the home care aide workforce in Ohio are immigrants; in Georgia, the figure is 12 percent. Osterman also does not believe a crackdown on undocumented workers would affect the caregiving labor market much. Young men make up a very large part of the undocumented population and nationally, nearly 90 percent of direct care workers are female. “Undocumented workers as a group are unlikely to be a dominant source of labor for these jobs,” he said. Caregivers earn very low wages - median income for CNAs in 2015 was $20,000, and home care aides earned a median of $15,000, according to Census data. Normally, a labor shortage would resolve itself by putting upward pressure on wages - which would bring more workers into the field. But in this case, the impact on wages - and the caregiving shortage - will be uneven, Osterman said. Two-thirds of long-term care in the United States is funded by the federal Medicaid program, with the remainder paid through private commercial insurance or out of pocket. Medicaid payment policies vary widely among the states, but Osterman worries that in many states, care facilities funded by cash-strapped Medicaid programs will not be able to boost wages. “It’s difficult for wages to rise because they are set bureaucratically according to Medicaid reimbursement rates,” he said. Meanwhile, wages in the high-end private payer market will rise, with a corresponding impact on the cost of care and insurance. Osterman’s book is not completely doom and gloom. He holds out hope that we can attract more workers to caregiving by making the occupation more attractive. One needed change, he said, is attitudinal. Many key actors in the profession - doctors, hospitals, regulators, legislators and insurance companies - simply do not demonstrate respect for direct care workers, which is an obstacle to improving the job. The second challenge, he writes, is the complexity of our care delivery system and its financing mechanisms, both of which make reforms difficult to implement. Osterman also argues for restructuring the roles of caregivers. Currently, new caregiving workers receive only about two weeks of job training; expanding that could open the door to broader responsibilities. “In some states, a caregiver can’t administer eye drops, or help with wound care,” he said. He thinks caregiving workers could be trained to help with responsibilities like physical therapy, or coaching people with diabetes on eating and exercise. That could attract more workers, he thinks, and save money in the healthcare system by shifting tasks away from higher-paid workers such as nurses. “The point of my book is not to be nice,” he said. “It’s really a financial case for doing this, and an argument for an important social policy.” ","

436,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"Investors have been wondering about Siemens’ plans for Healthineers, valued at up to 40 billion euros ($47 billion), since Chief Executive Joe Kaeser announced last November he planned some kind of listing but gave no details. The delay, along with quarterly results that were dragged down by the group's energy-related businesses, sent Siemens shares down more than 3 percent to the bottom of the blue-chip DAX .GDAXI and an eight-month low on Thursday. Kaeser pronounced himself partially satisfied with the quarter, which was however overshadowed by a controversy about Siemens gas turbines that were transported from Russia to Crimea, the subject of energy-technology sanctions. “Everything is not perfect at Siemens,” Kaeser, who extended his contract until 2021, told reporters on a conference call. “The Crimea affair has cost us much time and effort. We have to ask ourselves what this means for our future business processes and relationships.” Siemens said last month it had credible evidence that all four gas turbines it delivered a year ago for a project in southern Russia had been illegally moved to Crimea, confirming a series of Reuters reports.. A review of Siemens business practices in Russia could cost 100-200 million euros in sales, Kaeser said. The Power and Gas business faced challenges from a global trend away from the large turbines in which Siemens specializes. It reported a 41 percent drop in orders and a worse-than-expected 23 percent fall in profit. Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas said competition in that business remained intense. “We have a tough year before us and also a very difficult 2018. Structural changes will be unavoidable,” he told reporters on a conference call. “Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy was responsible for 90 percent of the consensus miss regarding orders,” Baader wrote in a note, keeping its “buy” rating. “Furthermore, the order decline in Power and Gas was more pronounced than expected.” Thomas said Power and Gas was unlikely to hit its profit margin target range in the year to the end of September. Siemens’ overall industrial profit margin fell to 10.4 percent from 10.8 percent due to acquisition-related effects. The company wants to get closer to the profitability of rivals, as Kaeser moves the trains-to-turbines group gradually away from its conglomerate structure. Kaeser, a former Siemens finance chief who seized power in a boardroom coup in 2013, is popular with investors for eliminating the nasty surprises that used to plague the group and slimming down its portfolio. Alongside Healthineers, Siemens’ profits were supported by automation software unit Digital Factory and transportation unit Mobility, which beat expectations. Siemens’ overall profit from its industrial businesses was 2.25 billion euros, below a Reuters poll average of 2.41 billion. Orders fell 9 percent and sales rose 3 percent. The company confirmed its full-year forecasts, which include moderate sales growth, a book-to-bill ratio above 1 and an industrial profit margin of 11-12 percent. Siemens wants Healthineers to have its own currency for acquisitions and investments as the global healthcare market shifts focus from Siemens’ core business of imaging to molecular diagnosis and patient self-management. But Michael Sen, the board member with responsibility for Healthineers, said there was no list of M&A targets as such. “The equity story begins with a highly attractive portfolio, which we already have,” he told reporters. Sen highlighted the attractions of a listing in the United States rather than Germany. Siemens has so far left it open where it will list Healthineers. “Most peer group companies... are listed in the USA,” he told reporters. “One has to ask where will one get the best research and coverage... and sufficient market making capacity and liquidity.” ","

437,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United Nations urged Thailand on Tuesday to drop criminal cases against female activists who campaign for the rights of their communities, amid concerns they face increasing harassment. The call came after the wife of a prominent Thai land rights activist was jailed last week and a separate group of female activists who protested against a gold mining operation were indicted for breaching public assembly laws. The U.N. Human Rights Office for Southeast Asia expressed concern over the two cases and said the female activists must be allow to campaign “without fear or threat of lawsuits, harassment, violence or intimidation”. “The crucial work of women human rights defenders in Thailand should be enabled and protected, not prevented,” its acting deputy representative Katia Chirizzi said in a statement. Supap Kamlae, wife of missing rights campaigner Den Kamlae, was sentenced to six months in prison last Thursday for forest encroachment in a land dispute involving her community in northeast Thailand, the United Nations said. Before his disappearance in April 2016, Den had been fighting for his community to be awarded legal title to land they occupy in a wildlife sanctuary. Authorities have denied any knowledge of his whereabouts. In another case, seven women activists in the northeastern province of Loei face up to five and a half years in jail after they were indicted on July 25 for violating public assembly and criminal laws, according to the statement. The women had led local residents in opposing a gold mining operation which they fear might jeopardize their health and the environment. Thailand has a history of land rights activists disappearing or being killed. Rural women at the forefront of rights issues related to land, environment and natural resources have been at increasing risk of violence, threats and harassment since Thailand’s military seized power in a 2014 coup, according to a study last month by several rights groups.

439, ,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aviation authorities were ordered back to the drawing board on Friday to solve what a federal appeals judge called “The Case of the Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat.” Judge Patricia Millett told the Federal Aviation Administration to take another look at an advocacy group’s assertion that shrinking airline seats are imperiling passenger safety. The judge rejected the FAA’s argument that seat size was unimportant to getting off the plane in an emergency. “That makes no sense,” she wrote for the three-judge panel, likening the rationale to doing “a study on tooth decay that only recorded participants’ sugar consumption” but did not look at brushing and flossing. All three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed the FAA must conduct a new review of the request for regulations setting a minimum airline seat size, but Judge Judith Rogers dissented from part of the court’s rationale. Airline seats have steadily decreased in size over the last several decades. Economy-class seat pitch has decreased from an average of 35 inches (89 cm) in the 1970s to 31 inches (79 cm), and in some airplanes to 28 inches (71 cm). Average seat width has narrowed from about 18 inches (46 cm)to 16.5 inches (42 cm) over the last decade. Critics accuse the airlines of being more interested in profit than passenger health and safety. FAA spokesman Greg Martin wrote in an e-mail the agency “does consider seat pitch in testing and assessing the safe evacuation of commercial, passenger aircraft. We are studying the ruling carefully and any potential actions we may take to address the court’s findings.” An airline trade group declined to comment. Seat pitch is the distance from one seat to the same spot on the one in front or behind. The ruling was limited to the question of whether smaller seats and larger passengers could have an impact on emergency egress. It did not require the FAA to look at the impact on comfort and health. A U.S. House of Representatives bill under consideration would require the FAA to set minimum seat sizes on U.S. airlines and a minimum distance between rows to “protect the safety and health of airline passengers.” Last month American Airlines Group Inc said it would reduce leg room by one inch to 30 inches instead of two as originally planned on some seats in its Boeing 737 MAX jets. United Airlines President Scott Kirby told a congressional hearing in May the airline had yet to decide whether to cut pitch to 29 inches in some seats. Nearly all United seats have at least 31 inches of pitch. ","

441,Ylan Mui,8032017,CNBC,7272017,"Faced with deep divisions within the Republican party, the White House and some conservative groups are targeting red-state Democrats in hopes of winning support for a sweeping rewrite of the nation's tax code and salvaging their economic agenda. White House legislative director Marc Short told reporters Monday that he is making the case for tax reform to Democratic lawmakers in the Upper Midwest and from states with strong manufacturing industries, such as Pennsylvania. Americans For Prosperity President Tim Phillips said his group, a conservative advocacy shop funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, will pressure Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Its sister group, Freedom Partners, has called out West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin for previously supporting lower tax rates. The strategy is an acknowledgement that Republicans' fractious caucus has been unable to reach consensus on key issues—most notably the long-sought effort to repeal and replace Obamacare—but also the budget and raising the debt ceiling. In the House, Short said he has met with the centrist Blue Dog Democrats and the Problem Solvers Caucus, which is spearheading a bipartisan health care bill. Even in the Senate, where Republicans only need a simple majority to pass tax reform using special parliamentary rules, victory is far from guaranteed. Republicans hold a narrow control of just 52 seats, turning the backing of just one or two Democrats into a possible game-changer. ""We've learned how difficult it is to thread the needle with 52 senators,"" Short said at an tax reform event Monday sponsored by the Koch groups. Even the event's theme—""Unrig the Economy""—mirrored language that Democrats have been using as they roll out their platform for 2018. On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outlined the party's priorities in any rewrite of the tax code in a letter to the White House and GOP leadership that was signed by all but three Democratic senators, Donnelly, Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, all of whom hail from red states and are up for re-election next year. ""Senator Heitkamp is approaching tax reform with an open mind, and she wants work across the aisle to help make reforms that will grow the economy and support working families,"" a spokesperson said. An aide to Donnelly said he supports a bipartisan process for tax reform and is ""ready to exchange ideas with others in Congress and the Trump administration."" Manchin did not return a request for comment. Democrats were united in opposing the health care bill, which not only would have left millions without insurance but was also viewed as an attack on one of President Obama's signature achievements. Tax reform does not carry the same political symbolism, however. Holding the line could test the strength of Democratic leadership. Schumer's letter listed three requirements for cooperation on tax reform: preventing a tax hike on the middle-class, passing legislation through regular order rather than special rules known as reconciliation and ensuring that tax cuts do not add to the deficit. ""We are confident that, by working together, we could modernize our tax system to increase working families' wages, improve middle-class job growth, promote domestic investment, modernize our outdated business and international tax systems and put in place sound fiscal policy that raises the revenue needed to meet the needs of our country,"" the letter states. Jim Manley, a former top aide to Sen. Harry Reid, said the bar for winning over any members of the other party is high—even for the letter's holdouts. The chaos surrounding the Trump administration has chipped away at the president's leverage, he said, making it harder for Republicans to woo red-state Democrats. ""No one's afraid of the guy anymore. No one sees the need to try to cut deals with him,"" Manley said. ""No one's afraid of getting on the wrong side of a Trump tweet storm anymore.""

442,Jake Novak,8032017,CNBC,7272017,"An unwritten rule in politics is: If you can't get the public to like you, help them find someone they like even less. President Donald Trump may have done just that in the health-bill wars by shining a light on health insurance companies and members of Congress. He hit those two birds with one stone in this single tweet Monday morning: tweet President Trump is referring to the massive direct and indirect subsidies the health insurance companies have enjoyed thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the employer-provided funds members of Congress and their staffs receive to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. Let's start with the health-insurance companies. The bottom line is that the industry has been enriched significantly by Obamacare. The shares of Aetna, Anthem, Centene, Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealth have all outperformed the overall stock market, which has had a solid run, since 2010. But even before those new profits came pouring in, health insurers weren't exactly loved. Premiums were rising faster than income growth in America for years and those costs were increasingly becoming a middle class problem.  Doctors and medical staffs were becoming more and more frustrated with the way insurance companies were taking control of how patients were treated and basically how much everyone in the medical industry was paid. That frustration is still very much out there today. But during this Obamacare repeal and replacement process, the insurers have more than secured their financial position — they've assumed such a supreme level of undeserved importance in America that politicians on both sides of the partisan aisle act as if propping them up is of the greatest national importance. To be fair, health insurance can and should serve a role in providing healthy and relatively healthy people some kind of hedge against an unexpected major or emergency medical cost. But its usefulness as a middleman industry to cover costs for routine check-ups and procedures is dubious at best. In short, it's the wrong fit for customers, providers, and a road block for a natural free market price-reduction process. President Trump's decision to question special government payments to insurers will gain traction if he keeps it up. Remember, he's not bashing the doctors many Americans trust or the hospitals we rely on. He's going after an entity most of us never really see with employers most of us never meet. But even if you don't buy the idea that most Americans will get behind President Trump bashing or at least questioning the health insurers, it's much easier to see the wisdom of shining a light on and threatening any and all special perks members of Congress enjoy compared to the rest of us. Just to clarify things, President Obama's Office of Personnel Management made a controversial move in 2010 to direct members of Congress and their aides to buy insurance from a part of the District of Columbia exchange designed for small businesses. They pick from a selection of the most generous small group plans on sale in that exchange, but only pay about 25 percent of the premium themselves. The rest of the cost is covered by the House and Senate budget. It's a nice perk and really no change from the cushy health-care benefits Congress and congressional staffers enjoyed before Obamacare. By threatening that perk, President Trump has broken an unofficial agreement within the political class not to mess with professional courtesies. It's that agreement that guarantees automatic pay raises for members of Congress and other cases of special treatment. But it's a good bet a major section of the American people will join in his scrutiny of Congress, even if they don't also start to back the White House generally. And while the public may just want this debate to go away, leave Obamacare in place, and move on, there is no moving on from this issue. Because right now, insurers are demanding to know what kinds of subsidies and other government aid they'll be getting to remain in the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. And lots of members of Congress from both parties are as eager as ever to secure those subsidies and aid in all their crony capitalist glory. Now, President Trump has at least started to use a weapon that can not only reopen the Obamacare repeal process, but do so in a way that gives all members of the House and Senate a new sense of urgency. Let's see if Capitol Hill gets the message. ",Trump has a new winning message in Obamacare battle—commentary,0.9943

444,Catherine Clifford,8032017,CNBC,7272017,"Friday night, the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk appeared in front of a cheering and adoring audience, much like a rockstar appears on stage before performing a show, to unveil the new Model 3 Tesla. The event was to celebrate the first 30 customers (all Tesla employees) getting their Model 3's. Early production has been slow, but Musk expects to be able to produce 20,000 Model 3 Teslas per month by December. Ramping up production is going to be brutal, Musk warned. ""We're going to go through at least six months of manufacturing hell,"" the Tesla CEO told a group of journalists ahead of the Model 3 event. On stage, Musk echoed the sentiment. According to the Fremont, Calif., factory workers, Tesla is already putting its employees through a lot. ""One of the most serious issues concerns our health and safety,"" says a letter a group of factory workers from Tesla's main Fremont, Calif., facility submitted to the independent board members of Tesla on Monday, just three days after the Model 3 event and amid an ongoing effort to unionize. ""Accidents happen every day. Severe incidents frequently impact morale and cause delays in production. We are losing great workers who are valuable to both our production team and to their families while they spend time on medical leave, recovering from preventable injuries."" In May, California-based worker safety organization Worksafe published an extensive report after it analyzed the log of work-related injuries and illnesses at Tesla. It found that Tesla's ""total recordable incidence rate"" was 8.8 percent (8.8 injuries per 100 workers) in 2015, the last full-year that data is available for. That's 31 percent more than the 6.7 percent total recordable incidence rate for the automobile industry as a whole, the report found, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That 8.8 percent injury rate is higher than the similar injury rates of both sawmills and slaughterhouses, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sawmills have an injury rate of 7.3 percent and slaughterhouses have an injury rate of 5.1 to 7.3 percent, depending on the type of processing. The issue of worker safety at Tesla manufacturing facilities is not new. Tesla factory worker Jose Moran wrote a post on Medium in February detailing the conditions and proposing a union. ""We are working hard to build the world's #1 car  —  not just electric, but overall. Unfortunately, however, I often feel like I am working for a company of the future under working conditions of the past,"" Moran wrote. ""Just as CEO Elon Musk is a respected champion for green energy and innovation, I hope he can also become a champion for his employees."" The workers say they want access to information about the dangers of the jobs they are doing, and they want a voice in the conversation about how to fix the safety issues. Thank you to all our employees for your hard work making Model 3 a reality Beyond safety concerns, the group wants clear guidelines on what is required to be promoted at the company. ""Many of us have worked hard for years with the vague promise of a raise, to no end,"" the letter states. Pay at the Fremont production facility starts at $18 per hour, which is below both the national average for auto workers ($25.58), according to The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). ""We strongly believe that a defined understanding of success and reward will have an impact on product quality,"" the letter says. Additionally, the Tesla employees say they want to be free to express themselves without fear of retribution. Musk reportedly works to build a culture where employees are encouraged to speak up, specifically for safety reasons. Yet the Tesla employees request ""neutrality and non-retaliation agreements with workers, which protect workers' ability to speak freely. Such agreements help build positive relationships between management and frontline workers."" An email to Tesla seeking a response to the factory workers' letter had not been responded to by the time this story was published. However when the Los Angeles Times wrote about the safety numbers in May, Tesla acknowledged the problems and said it had made improvements to the factory conditions. ""We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future,"" a company spokesman told the Times. ""With the changes we've made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far."" Like this story?

448,Jeff Daniels,8032017,CNBC,7272017,"Big Tobacco is feeling the sting not only from federal action but also from California tripling cigarette taxes in April, with some retailers indicating cigarette purchases are down as much as 50 percent. On the federal front, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday indicated it plans to slash nicotine levels in cigarettes to bring them to non-addictive levels. The FDA news is causing a sell-off in shares of tobacco companies, including Altria Group, owner of Philip Morris USA and the leading U.S. cigarette brand — Marlboro. In California, tobacco also is facing challenges due to April's steep increase in cigarette excise taxes. Several independent retailers interviewed for this story say the decline in sales was steeper than they had expected. However, some report that coupons provided by the tobacco companies are helping to cushion the blow. ""We're down 50 percent,"" said Sam Mroky, store manager at Cigarette Depot in San Diego. ""Before the price went up, a lot of people stocked up on cigarettes. I'm the cheapest one in the town now and … still business is no good."" The falloff in sales is evident in a study released this month by the state Legislative Analyst's Office. It shows revenues from the state's cigarette excise taxes plunged 64 percent in May 2017 compared with the year earlier. An informal check of more than a dozen independent retailers statewide found more than half of them were experiencing a drop of 10 percent or more in cigarette purchases. Several others, though, indicated they had seen a recovery in June or July and estimated purchases were down in single digits. California voters passed a measure in November to boost the cigarette tax by $2 a pack, up from the earlier 87-cent tax. Big tobacco companies spent more than $70 million fighting the voter measure, according to MapLight. The higher taxes are designed to discourage people from smoking by raising the price of cigarettes. California already has one of the nation's lowest adult smoking rates. ""We went down around 12 percent after the tax,"" said Andy Musayelyan, manager of Hollywood Smokes in Los Angeles. On Thursday, Altria reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share that were short of Thomson Reuters consensus. The company said its smokeable segment's results were hurt by the cigarette excise tax increase in California. According to Altria CEO Martin Barrington, the company's flagship brand, Marlboro, has more than 50 percent share in the California market. The CEO called California ""a high-volume state,"" noting it previously accounted for about 7 percent of total U.S. cigarette industry volume but since the tax increase its volume contribution fell to 5 percent. As a result, he said total U.S. industry cigarette volumes were down around 4.5 percent in the June quarter. Altria and other big tobacco companies have been using coupons to make the California tax hike more palatable to consumers. ""The tobacco companies have been sending out a lot of coupons to our customers,"" said Dave Mesesan, store manager for Rod's Liquor in Orange, California. ""They're trying to deal with the tax increase the best they can."" A bill that would have prohibited the redemption of all coupons and promotional discounts for tobacco products failed to pass recently in the state legislature. The bill was proposed by Assemblyman Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento). ""Tobacco coupons are nothing more than a deadly promotional trick by the tobacco industry to keep Californians smoking, leading to illness and early death for our residents, with taxpayers footing the bill,"" McCarty said in a statement. The higher cigarette prices also have attracted theft rings. Three suspects are being sought for several recent thefts of cigarettes from Walgreens stores in the L.A. area, according to the Burbank Police Department. It said there have been eight reported incidents involving the same suspects, including in Burbank, and estimated losses were running into the thousands of dollars. Similarly, there have been big thefts of cigarettes reported in recent months in other areas of the state, including Redding, Riverside and Bakersfield.

449,"Constance Gustke, special to CNBC.com",8032017,CNBC,7272017,"After working with people with dementia for many years as a licensed nursing home administrator, Scott Tarde was fed up with the lack of affordable care options. So as the CEO of George G. Glenner Alzheimer's Family Centers, he decided to reimagine a new kind of day care: a faux mini-town with a 1950s and 1960s look designed for people with dementia. His concept is based on reminiscence therapy. His creation is Glenner Town Square, set to open in San Diego next spring. Reminiscence therapy, developed by psychologist Ellen Langer in 1979, involves the use of past activities, events and experiences with other people, usually with the aid of music and tangible, visual prompts from earlier years, such as photographs and familiar household items. Glenner Town Square bathes the senses in sights and smells to reflect a person's younger days. Its 9,000 square feet of space, designed by renowned architect Douglas Pancake, sits in an industrial building and will include a pet store with shelter puppies, department store with clothes and a movie theater with real popcorn. Everyplace is staffed with trained caregivers. Besides being fun, the retro town, outfitted with gas-lit streetlamps, also has real uses, like triggering positive past memories, say experts, and can help people with dementia feel calmer and need fewer drugs. The goal is to offer a safe location where residents have a structured day, as well as autonomy and independence — giving them a higher quality of life. ""We're taking people back to their strongest memories,"" says Tarde, noting it is a form of time-travel therapy. ""Long-term memories are more preserved than short-term ones."" Tarde, who has 20 years of experience working in the long-term care industry, has targeted a growing demographic in America. An estimated 5.4 million people in the United States suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a number that is expected to grow as baby boomers age. Even more suffer from a form of dementia. He got the idea for the village after visiting a junior-achievement mini-city in San Diego, where young people discover how the ""real world"" works by learning how to generate wealth and effectively manage it. More from Modern Medicine:A major step forward in fighting Alzheimer'sNew technology that can help with hearing loss Tarde has ambitious national plans, too. He wants to build 100 of these day care centers throughout the United States within 20 years. ""Families need reliable options and meaningful experiences,"" he says. As the projected number of dementia patients grows, he adds, society will need new, viable solutions. Glenner Town Square fits into a new type of community called dementia villages. They're attempting to bring fresh models of care, rather than just relying on drugs to take the sharp edges off the disease. The villages also provide safety and connection, which can increase well-being. Tarde's creation may be the United States' first dementia village, though. In 2009 the first kind of residential dementia village appeared in Hogewey, Holland, outside Amsterdam. Inhabitants walk freely among the walled town's parklike grounds and live in housing units arranged by theme. There are also grocery stores, hair salons and pubs, where the staff works and keeps an eye on the 152 residents The village is about the size of 10 football fields. Bringing more residential dementia villages to the United States may be a challenge. Hogewey is mainly funded by the Dutch government. Glenner Town Square, conversely, is privately funded by real estate developers Village Holdings, who have anted up $1 million in capital so far. The cost for day visitors, though, is affordable at $95 per day, says Tarde. Still, Tarde is optimistic about the power of day programs like Glenner Town Square to transform lives. He believes that medicine alone can't effectively treat people with Alzheimer's. ""Many people can also stay home if they have the right support,"" he says. There's such a tsunami of dementia care needed, agrees Donna Surges Tatum, board of directors of the National Certification Board for Alzheimer and Aging Care. In the United States an estimated 4 million to 5 million Americans currently have dementia. It remains the most expensive disease in America — a study funded by the National Institute on Aging  estimated that in 2010 it cost up to $215 billion a year to care for dementia patients, surpassing heart disease ($102 billion) and cancer ($77 billion). In addition, 5.5 million people are currently living with Alzheimer's. By 2050 that number is projected to reach 13.8 million, according to the Alzheimer's Association. ""It's expensive to create a whole village,"" she says. ""And we have such trouble getting care to anyone needs who it these days."" Reminiscence therapy, which taps into positive back memories, works well, though, she adds. These villages also emphasize personalized care and more engagement, too. ""People are currently sometimes drugged more than necessary,"" she adds. Jason Karlawish, a co-director at Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees. He advocates for spaces that tap into well-learned memories and comfort. ""They should be safe, social and engaged,"" he says. Social isolation can even lead to dementia, according to studies, he says. ""People with dementia need to feel like they're part of the human race,"" he adds. ""And so we need new approaches that aren't just biomedical."" For people used to growing up on farms, Prairie Elder Care in Kansas has a different solution. It's developing a dementia-care residence farm in Overland Park, Kansas, set to open next year. Called Prairie Farmstead, it has chicken coops and gardens. About 16 residents will always be supervised. But they can also plant tomatoes or roam in a sensory garden with butterflies. The cost is about $7,400 per month. ""Men with dementia can be difficult to engage,"" says Mandy Shoemaker, co-owner of Prairie Elder Care. ""They end up being on lots of medications for aggressive behaviors."" The goal, she says, is giving them back control over their lives. ""Control is slowly lost over the most basic decisions,"" she adds, explaining that with more engagement, they can be more calm and connected. There are no one-size-fits-all dementia villages, though, says Mario Garrett, professor of gerontology at San Diego State University. ""Your 1950s is completely different then my 1950s,"" he says. Yet every attempt is a good one, he adds, since people with dementia tend to be ignored. Even dementia village models will evolve into something better, he says. ""People need emotional support.""

The baby-boomer generation is a massive part of the American population, made up of nearly 80 million people. This group of people is a big part of our economy, and their retirement over the next decade or so could have major implications on programs like Social Security and Medicare. With that in mind, here are some interesting statistics about baby boomers and their impact on the U.S. economy -- past, present, and future. Baby boomers are defined as people born between 1946 and 1964 in the post-World War II era. About 77 million Americans were born in this time period, making it significantly larger than the generations immediately before and after. While the millennial generation is even larger, this is still a massive group of people. Image Source: Getty Images. In Maine, 36.8% of the population is made up of baby boomers, with New Hampshire coming in a close second. Montana and Vermont also have baby-boomer concentrations of greater than 35%. On the other hand, California, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, and Utah have the lowest concentrations of baby boomers. Two-thirds of Baby Boomers think preserving Social Security and Medicare for themselves and future generations is even more important than reducing the deficit, according to a Pew Research survey. Separately, in a survey by the National Academy of Social Insurance, the majority of baby boomers of all income levels and political affiliations say they would gladly pay higher Social Security taxes to fix the program's funding issues. According to a survey from the National Endowment for Financial Education, 59% of baby boomers who are parents are financially supporting their children ages 18-39. There are several potential reasons for this, such as record-high student-debt levels and a difficult job market for recent college graduates. Perhaps related to worries about Social Security and Medicare, as well as the abundance of financial support they give to adult children, 65% of baby boomers plan to work past age 65. However, a study by Voya Financial found that 60% of retired workers had to stop working before they planned, for reasons such as layoffs and health concerns, one of the top reasons people claim Social Security at age 62. Despite the common perception of the millennial ""start-up"" culture, baby boomers are twice as likely as millennials to start a new business. Furthermore, 45% of baby boomers consider themselves to be entrepreneurs. According to a recent survey, baby boomers are projected to have 70% of all U.S. disposable income over the next five years. Not only that, but baby boomers will inherit about $15 trillion in the next 20 years. Surprisingly, AARP finds that this group is targeted by just 5%-10% of all marketing efforts. The median 401(k) balance of someone in the 55-64 age group is $177,805, according to a report from Vanguard. Using the commonly used ""4% rule"" of retirement, this translates to sustainable income of just $7,112 per year in retirement. Even when combined with Social Security income, this isn't nearly enough for most retirees to sustain their quality of life. Worse yet, 45% of baby boomers report having no retirement savings whatsoever. ","
      
    9 Baby-Boomer Statistics That Will Blow You Away -- The Motley Fool

Most Americans are eligible for Medicare benefits beginning in the month of their 65th birthday. Although it is the most widely used health insurance plan in the United States, many pre-retirees don't understand it well. With that in mind, if you're getting close to turning 65, here's some basic information about Medicare that you need to know. There are four different types of Medicare insurance, known as ""parts,"" designated with letters A through D. Here's the difference between each one: Collectively, Medicare Parts A and B are known as ""original Medicare."" These are the parts that nearly all senior citizens have. Image Source: Getty Images. If you're already collecting Social Security benefits, you will automatically be enrolled in Medicare, starting on the first day of the month in which you turn 65. If you're not collecting Social Security benefits, you'll need to apply for Medicare. You can apply for Medicare only at the Social Security Administration's website, and your initial enrollment period runs for seven months, beginning three months before the month of your 65th birthday. Having said that, it's still a good idea to sign up for Medicare Part A at 65. It's free, so there's really no reason not to. On the other hand, Medicare Part B has a monthly premium you'll have to pay, so it can be smart to wait if you aren't required to sign up during your initial enrollment period. For most retirees, Medicare Part A is free, meaning you probably won't have to pay a premium for your hospital insurance. Medicare Part B, medical insurance, is another story. The standard Medicare Part B premium is $134 per month in 2017, although beneficiaries who pay their premiums directly through their Social Security benefits pay slightly less, because of cost-of-living adjustment rules. In addition, high-income retirees pay higher premiums. This is based on the beneficiary's income from two years ago, so 2015 income was considered for 2017 Medicare Part B premiums. Single taxpayers with adjusted gross income greater than $85,000 and married couples with combined incomes over $170,000 pay Part B premiums of $187.50 to $428.60 per month, depending on their specific income level. Finally, Medicare advantage and prescription-drug plans have costs that vary widely, depending on variables such as location and scope of coverage. As I mentioned, ""original Medicare"" refers to parts A and B. Since virtually all Americans over 65 will have original Medicare, it's important to know what it covers, and what you'll still be responsible for paying. First, of all, Medicare Part A covers hospital service, including meals, drugs, and other services while hospitalized. It also covers skilled nursing facilities for a limited amount of time, nursing home care that is deemed medically necessary, hospice care, and some home health services. In addition to doctors' office visits, Medicare Part B covers outpatient surgeries, as well as necessary medical supplies, such as wheelchairs and walkers. It also pays for preventative services such as lab tests, disease screenings, and disease-preventing services, such as an annual flu shot. However, there are some medical costs that Medicare doesn't cover, such as: In addition to this list, it's important to point out that you'll have some out-of-pocket costs for covered services as well. For starters, Medicare Part A has a $1,316 deductible per benefit period for inpatient hospital stays, and a coinsurance requirement of at least $329 per day for stays longer than 60 days. Skilled nursing facility stays are only fully covered for 20 days, and you'll pay a $164.50 daily coinsurance payment for longer stays, up to 100 days, at which point Medicare stops paying. Part B has a lower $183 annual deductible, but after this is met, Medicare generally covers 80% of covered services, leaving you responsible for the other 20%. These copays, deductibles, and coinsurance requirements are collectively referred to as ""Medigaps."" To limit your unexpected healthcare costs, a Medicare Supplemental Insurance Plan, or Medigap plan, can be purchased. There are 10 different types of Medigap plans, and price and availability depend on your location. You can read the features of all 10 plans at Medicare's website, but an important point is that Plan F is the most comprehensive, as well as the most popular. While it's a bit more expensive than other Medigap plans (average monthly cost of $159-$239 for a 65-year-old male), it covers virtually every copay, deductible, or coinsurance payment Medicare Parts A and B could ask you to pay. The bottom line is that by knowing the basics of Medicare, you'll know when and how to sign up, how much you'll pay for it, how much of your costs Medicare will cover, and how to protect yourself from uncertainty.

McCormick & Company Inc. (NYSE:MKC) recently announced it will acquire the food division of British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in a $4.2 billion deal that is expected to close later this year. Many products familiar to U.S. shoppers will join McCormick, including Frank's RedHot hot sauce, French's ketchup, French's mustard, and Cattleman's barbecue sauce. The deal will make McCormick the largest supplier of condiments in the United States. Image source: McCormick. Health, hygiene, and home products produced the lion's share of Reckitt Benckiser's more than $12 billion in 2016 revenue. Its food division was expected to provide $581 million in 2017 sales and the business has been growing in the mid-single digits, according to McCormick's management. The way McCormick CEO Lawrence Kurzius described it, Reckitt Benckiser's food division was a ""food asset trapped inside a nonfood company. ... For us, this is going to be a core business, and we're going to treat it accordingly."" McCormick believes it can give the acquired brands a friendlier base of operations as its $4.4 billion in 2016 revenue came entirely from food products. Management feels the company's expertise in the food business can result in increased sales due to more exposure to both the industrial segment of the market (which includes customers like restaurants), where McCormick sold 40% of its products,  and internationally, where McCormick sold 42% of its products in 2016. McCormick is a leader in spices and seasoning, with about 20% market share in the packaged retail spices and seasoning category of foods on a global basis. The key brand that drove McCormick to make the acquisition is Frank's RedHot Sauce, the product with the largest growth potential in the portfolio of brands that came with the acquisition. McCormick sees Frank's RedHot Sauce as a ""liquid spice"" that's very popular with millennials and has a runway for growth. ""... the hot sauce category and the Frank's RedHot brand, in particular, really drive the growth of the whole portfolio,"" said Kurzius. Management believes it can expand Frank's brand beyond the United States and Canada by increasing its presence in the Asian marketplace, where Western condiments have become quite popular, particularly for table-top usage in restaurants, not a distribution channel that current ownership has access to. McCormick management stated that their goal is to Make Frank's RedHot sauce the No. 1 global hot sauce brand. The company is also quite keen on French's mustard, the No. 1 brand in the U.S. and Canada. The price tag was $4.2 billion, which is over seven times the food division's estimated 2017 revenue of $581 million. The chart below shows McCormick's price to sales multiple over the past three years, which barely ever reached three. MKC PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts The price tag of $4.2 billion will be paid all in cash. McCormick will finance the deal in two ways. The company will work with lenders to borrow $3.7 billion. The other $500 million will come in the form of an equity offering of the company's stock. The company also announced, in light of the deal, it will suspend its share buyback program to conserve cash. Management reiterated that the company plans to continue issuing its quarterly dividend. The additional debt the company will take on will increase its borrowings from $804 million at the end of last quarter to a projected $4.5 billion when the deal closes. The company said it will update shareholders once the deal closes toward the end of this year. Until then, management will continue to focus on the current brands under the McCormick umbrella. The company sees French's products being its No. 2 brand and Frank's RedHot Sauce as its No. 3 brand, both of which will help McCormick move up from its current position as the No. 10 condiments supplier in the United States to No. 1 stateside and No. 3 on a global basis. This is a big investment for the company; the largest acquisition it has ever made. It is taking on a lot of debt to make the purchase. Time will tell if management is able to integrate the business, execute its plan, and reward shareholders with a higher stock price. ","

Watch!” he said. It won’t necessarily happen by itself. The Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, has been plagued by high-profile health insurer exits and rising premiums.

And the Congressional Budget Office said in March that the individual market would likely be stable in most areas under current law. There are a few ways Trump can help implosion occur. He’s most likely to do so through cost-sharing reduction payments, which pay back health insurers for the increased cost of certain plans on the ACA’s marketplaces. “If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn’t it hurt the insurance companies,” Trump said in a Monday tweet in which he appeared to allude to the cost-sharing payments. See our previous coverage of this issue: What Trump can do to undermine Obamacare, now that the GOP health bill has failed Trump threatened to withhold cost-sharing payments this past spring as a negotiating tactic with Congressional Democrats. Without them, health insurers might stop offering plans, causing consumers to lose health insurance, according to The Commonwealth Fund, a health-care foundation. That “could immediately destabilize the exchanges, perhaps fatally,” said Spencer Perlman, director of health-care research at Veda Partners, an investment advisor and consultancy. Trump could withhold the payments in August, said Height Securities analyst Stefanie Miller, “before Congress will be in a position to take that authority away from Trump legislatively.” (Congress has an extended recess coming up.) The Trump administration could either end an appeal of a lawsuit over the cost-sharing payments on Aug. 20 or just decide not to make the payments, which are scheduled for Aug. 21, Perlman said. Related:  Trump aims to squeeze Democrats into health-care negotiations There are also other ways to sabotage the health care law, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Tom Price. Enrollment in the ACA’s exchanges is one key measure of the health law’s success. But enrollment appears highly dependent on marketing and promotion of the exchanges, making it an easy target for the administration. Read more:  ‘Skinny’ repeal of Obamacare fails to pass in late-night Senate vote For example, enrollment for 2017 exchange plans looked like it was on track to surpass previous years until, under Trump’s administration, it dropped off. “The secretary certainly can undermine the functioning of the ACA by refusing to encourage enrollment,” Veda’s Perlman said. But it’ll be difficult for Price to change exchange plan requirements, since “Price’s ability to alter the ACA’s insurance rules via the regulatory process is actually quite limited.” But it’s likely that Congress will have to tackle market stabilization next, both Perlman and Miller said, probably when members return to work in September. Bipartisan cooperation will be necessary, though, and “we do not expect Republicans and Democrats to reach a compromise quickly, meaning that uncertainty is likely to continue to plague the exchanges over the coming weeks and months,” Perlman said. That also means Medicaid and Medicaid expansion are “safe for now,” he said, though hospitals — expected to be hit hard by ACA repeal — should keep facing challenges.

                                    UCO, +1.89% The research I provided to clients in June suggested that oil prices were not appropriately reflecting the fundamentals. But oil moves with so much momentum, we need to focus on price. When WTI rose above $47 per barrel, it broke above a resistance line that opened the door for an increase to just above $50 a barrel, which was tested Monday. Oil may keep rising Notwithstanding the fundamental observations, WTI will need to increase beyond Monday’s highs in order to break resistance, and so far it is failing to do that. With the fundamental observations in tow, my research suggests that the possibility of a continued increase is very high, as the market finally starts to appreciate the influence of OPEC. Although mathematically we could calculate the difference in domestic supply given the reduced shipments from Saudi Arabia about two months ago, traders in the oil space were so bearish that they did not care. Finally, those reduced shipments are starting to impact U.S. stockpiles. Shipments take about 1.5 months to reach the U.S. from Saudi Arabia, so the impact on U.S. stockpiles is not felt until an equivalent amount of time after shipments have stopped. There now has been ample time, and the impact is being felt, and that changes the sentiment of oil traders. OPEC’s influence Although the influence of OPEC has already significantly reduced global supplies, measuring stockpiles globally is much more difficult than measuring stockpiles in the United States. As those global stockpiles declined, the United States saw increases, which led traders to believe that OPEC was not influencing the global oil market. Quite to the contrary, OPEC is doing a big job of reducing global supply, and it will continue to do so. And, finally, given what Saudi Arabia has chosen to do, the impact of OPEC will also be measurable in U.S. stockpiles. This is a material difference between what we could mathematically anticipate when Saudi Arabian shipments changed months ago, because now it is tangible. This is not expected to change anytime soon, and Saudi Arabia is not shipping oil to the United States like it did last year, or in the past. That will continue to reduce U.S. stockpiles. As far as the fundamentals are concerned, traders can now measure the reduction in stockpiles much more tangibly than they were able to before. The data now point to materially lower stockpiles because Saudi Arabia has taken aim at U.S. supply after realizing that traders were laser-focused on that specific data. Thomas H.

Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, offered a colorful and presumably aggressive strategy during an MSNBC interview Wednesday: Carter said it was “perfectly fair” for President Donald Trump to have called out Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, by name as standing in the way of the repeal and/or replace effort, having voted no on the motion to proceed Tuesday, causing Vice President Mike Pence to step in with a tie-breaking vote. “This is extremely frustrating.” Carter said the American Health Care Act — on which, he said, the House’s health-care subcommittee had spent 27½ hours working — is a good bill that “needs to pass.” Though admittedly an exurban dictionary might be more handy in the matter, the Urban Dictionary defined the phrase “snatch a knot” thusly: ",How Congressman Buddy Carter got the whole country looking up the phrase ‘snatch a knot’ - MarketWatch,0.5279

                                   following of millions, but many shame their employees in other ways, including trash-talking the employee to their peers, telling an employee not to attend certain meetings any more, or moving them to a remote office, said Kenneth Siegel, the president of The Impact Group, a management consultancy based in Los Angeles. “All of those are versions of public shaming, under the guise of transparent feedback,” Siegel said. Some 27% of bosses have a current direct report they would like to see leave their company, according to a survey of about 2,000 employees from the jobs site CareerBuilder in 2013. Less than half, 42%, said they have given those employees a formal warning that their job is in danger. And the rest? Some 27% say they pointed out the employee’s’ shortcomings, 21% said they reduced the employee’s responsibilities and 12% said they hired someone else to replace the employee. If you fear you’re being edged out like Sessions, here are 5 things to do next: Figure out if your fears are legitimate A boss may show their dissatisfaction in passive-aggressive ways, including through negative facial expressions or not providing the resources employees need to do their jobs. If you experience those, it’s usually a good idea to set up a one-on-one meeting to find out the truth, said Marc Cenedella, the founder and CEO of Ladders, a career site. It’s the employee’s job to set up that meeting, he said. In fact, they should be asking for meetings like those regularly even before they’re worried about losing their job so they know where they stand. Before the meeting, take a moment to reflect on what information you need from your boss, Cenedella said. Try not to let your feelings about the situation overwhelm you. Don’t make accusations — ask questions “It’s totally OK to have emotions, but you need to think through what you want to do,” he said. Instead, clarify the situation with your boss. Don’t accuse your boss of bad behavior, he said, but ask, “What should I understand from your feedback?” Using “I” statements such as “I have noticed you have not responded to me as frequently” or “I feel I am being left out of meetings” can help, Siegel said. Ask the boss for three specific things to improve and whether or not, in their estimation, you have the ability to improve, Cenedella said. And, then, ask what “success” would look like if you’re able to complete them. Ask your boss if your job can be saved It’s difficult to do, but an employee should actually ask whether the boss sees a path to recovering the job, Siegel said. He suggested saying something along the lines of, “If I were to spend the time and energy to enhance my skill set, or learn this software program, or become a better designer, would that matter?” If the boss says it is possible, keep a written record of your goals and check in periodically to review them, Cenedella said. Start cutting back on your spending If you want to stay in your job, but you’re afraid of being fired, start preparing financially, Siegel said. Personal finance experts typically recommend having three to six months’ worth of expenses saved for such a situation, but many Americans don’t have enough money in the bank to weather a job loss. “Maybe you put off buying that high-end car, or piece of art, or don’t go on that family vacation if you’ve gotten some forewarning you’re likely to be unemployed,” Siegel said. Plan an exit strategy (just in case) This is also the right time to reconnect with people in your professional network who work outside your company, Cenedella said. Even for people who are not desperately seeking a new job, make a list of 10 ideal companies to work for. Then, they should make it a goal to reach out to at least one person who works at each company over the course of a year, for a lunch, breakfast, coffee or drinks. “Having that ‘in’ is so helpful,” he said. Of course, if you think your boss is edging you out for a discriminatory reason — such as age, race, gender or sexuality — you may want to seek legal advice, Cenedella said. Either way, Siegel said workers should approach the delicate situation of wondering if they’re being edged out with as little emotion and panic as possible, as difficult as that might seem. “All of this implies your boss has some level of decency,” he said.

460,Paul Brandus,8032017,MarketWatch,7272017,"Published: July 28, 2017 9:34 a.m. ET Mount Rushmore may not be destination for the nation’s 45th president By The Trump White House is mad at us (White House reporters) because we haven’t spent any time reporting on President Trump’s legislative accomplishments, to which I reply, “What legislative accomplishments?” Like healthcare? And they think we should cover his tax plans and infrastructure plans. To which I reply: “What plans?” Also read: Dropping border adjustment plan limits tax-reform push Here we are, more than six months in and Trump—who conned his believers into thinking everything would be a cakewalk—has no major legislative achievement he can point to. Nothing. Trumpsters think he’s busy, busy, busy they confuse activity and bluster with actual accomplishment. Here’s the reality: This president is a lazy old man who golfs, watches TV and tweets. That’s about all. He barely lifted a finger on healthcare. No town halls, no speeches, nothing. On taxes, Trump unveiled what he called his “tax plan” back in April. It took up less than a page and had a couple of bullet points. It was really just the equivalent of a few tweets. No substance, no detail. For example, on taxes, he hasn’t said what income thresholds will be for the brackets he wants (10%, 25% and 35%); he hasn’t specified what tax breaks should be kept and what shouldn’t; he hasn’t detailed what he would do tax-wise for businesses. Various people in the administration have spoken of various things, but again—no specific, formal proposals yet. As Trump likes to say: Sad! Also read: ‘Skinny’ repeal of Obamacare fails to pass in late-night Senate vote Same thing with infrastructure. Lots of talk, few specific details. These are giant issues and with Republicans dominating Congress, Trump should have racked up a win or two by now. Instead he appears focused on nonsense: immature rants on Twitter, wondering why the media hasn’t recognized his towering genius, hinting that his hand-picked Attorney General Jeff Sessions isn’t up the job, and making such a fool of himself at a Boy Scout jamboree that Scout officials actually issued an apology to parents. And that’s just this week. Speaking of Sessions, for those of you who are all in on Trump, who automatically believe everything he says, square this circle for me: He claims he fired FBI Director James Comey because Comey was mean to Hillary Clinton. But now he’s mad at Sessions for being too nice to Clinton, for not launching yet another investigation of her. Huh? Trump, of course, is also furious that Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. Translation: Sessions, the top law enforcement officer in the United States, is loyal to the Constitution, not the president—and this bugs Trump. Sessions is “weak,” Trump has said—about the worst thing you can be in Trumpworld—short of having bad hair, being badly dressed or fat (the junk food-scarfing, non-exercising president excluded, of course). That the president is picking fights with his own Attorney General—for doing his job—is mind blowing. Trump thinks that ethics, the rule of law, the Constitution itself—that stuff’s for suckers. Funny thing is I seem to recall that back on Jan. 20, Trump put his hand on a bible and swore to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution himself. Perhaps I was mistaken. So much has happened since then, it’s hard to remember. The president also said this week that he might wind up on Mount Rushmore with Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. That’s how great he thinks he is. Does he know why those four truly great presidents were selected for Rushmore? Sculptor Gutzon Borglum picked Washington because he was the father of our country and laid the foundation for American democracy; Trump has chiseled away at it with his attacks on our independent judiciary and free press. Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence; he wrote that “all men are created equal.” But Trump, to borrow from George Orwell, believes that some are more equal than others. Lincoln preserved the Union and abolished slavery; Trump has quietly rolled back enforcement of civil rights laws. Theodore Roosevelt was chosen for several things, including his focus on conservation and preserving America’s natural beauty; Trump installed a guy at the Environmental Protection Agency who has proceeded to weaken regulations that keep the air you breathe and water you drink safe. Trump says he’s doing great. Why, just a month ago he bragged that his favorite poll Rasmussen, had his approval rating at 50%. He has always said that Rasmussen is the best poll, the fairest poll, the most accurate poll. OK: that same poll now has his approval at 41%. In fact, since Inauguration day, it has been sliding steadily. January 20: 56%. April 20: 49%. Today: 41%. Again that’s the one poll Trump says is the best, fairest, most accurate. Even his buddies at Fox News have his approval at 41%. Fox and Rasmussen. What do you say, Trumpeters? So much winning! The problem for Trump is that presidents, usually, are never more popular than in the first year. You’ve got to get the big stuff done quickly before that power ebbs. Trump’s time—and political capital—is quickly running out. Mount Rushmore may have to wait. ",Trump’s time—and political capital—is quickly running out - MarketWatch,0.9721
461,Elliot Blair Smith,8032017,MarketWatch,7272017,"Published: Aug 2, 2017 11:39 a.m. ET By Once the Grenfell Tower landlord in London agreed to substitute cheaper construction materials to renovate the 120-apartment building, a death trap was set waiting to be sprung. In June, an uncontrollable inferno at the 24-story public housing complex took at least 80 lives. Two parallel investigations are now under way: a criminal probe by the Metropolitan Police, and a broader public inquiry by a retired judge. The true purpose of building-safety standards is not to inflate costs—not to impose barriers to getting work done, nor to keep people from being compensated fairly—but rather to protect people. The Grenfell Tower tragedy exposed woefully inadequate building and fire-safety codes in Britain, and much wider haste to cut corners. And that lesson is lost in most arguments about rolling back regulations broadly, in the United States and elsewhere. “The disaster at Grenfell Tower should never have happened,” said Sajid Javid, Britain’s secretary of state for communities and local government, before Parliament. “It is already clear to us all that there will need to be changes.” For years, residents of Grenfell Tower contended with cold, drafty winters, and stiflingly hot summers. Renovation to dress up the aging concrete building—including a new aluminum skin, and windows—would better insulate it from rain, cold, and the beating sun. So about $13.5 million was targeted to improve the “poor condition” of the apartment complex between 2014 and 2016, according to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the neighborhood authority in one of London’s wealthiest districts. The work was loud, and tensions emerged among tenants who’d complained first about substandard conditions, and then about allegedly being kept uninformed. But authorities conducted a “door knocking” poll in December 2015—close to project completion—and found most occupants happy with the improvements to the heating, hot water, and new windows. While there’s a shambling charm to a tenant-landlord relationship that resolves complaints with a “door knocking,” it reflects a civic casualness that contributed to the uncontained blaze that turned the tower into a flaming skewer. Police now believe “there are reasonable grounds to suspect” that the borough and the tenant management organization “may have committed the offense of corporate manslaughter,” the BBC and others reported last week. Three years earlier, plans for fire-resistant exterior cladding were quietly replaced with a less expensive product; and the fire-retardant core proposed for each two-sheet aluminum panel was swapped out with a cheaper combustible alternative, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Guardian newspaper reported. Final project costs came down by $2.1 million. In the balance, one might calculate the value of human life. Celia Caliskan, an assistant to the Kensington and Chelsea neighborhood authority’s housing director, referred my query to the borough’s press office, which didn’t respond. British authorities have now tested at least 181 aluminum-veneer high-rises. “So far, all the samples of cladding tested have failed—that is 181 out of 181,” Javid told Parliament, with about 400 more buildings to be tested. Yet British authorities, builders, and citizens can’t seem to agree—and probably don’t know—whether the Grenfell Tower renovation met national fire-safety standards. Even if each building product individually met code requirements, it’s not clear they did so in combination. What seems certain is the cladding was more combustible than anyone admitted, and became a chimney spreading flames, heat, and fumes faster than firefighters could chase them. Michele Gianeselli, senior fire engineer at Chemolli Fire, an Italian fire-safety consultant licensed to do business in the United Kingdom, told me that aluminum cladding with a plastic core—sometimes called sandwich board—combined with plastic-foam insulation between the building and veneer, is “very cheap” and “easy to use” but will “increase the fire risk.” Even a British cladding trade group that previously argued against imposing supposedly cost-prohibitive fire-safety standards now offers stricter guidance.

                                    supplied the Grenfell Tower veneer through a sub-contractor on the project, and announced after the fire that it no longer will sell the product for any other high-rise construction. The company was formerly known as Alcoa, which it spun off last year as a separate company. The Centre for Window and Cladding Technology updated its recommendations earlier this year—prior to the blaze, it told me—stating that the approved fire-safety classification for aluminum cladding as used at Grenfell Tower “is no longer appropriate for such materials.” This policy shift by an industry group that Alcoa long was a member of seems to challenge the appropriateness of the product all along. The trade group’s new position also puts it at odds with the ongoing certification of Arconic’s Reynobond PE product by the British Board of Agrément—a nonprofit testing, inspection, and ecertification service—which describes itself as the “Gold Standard of product or system approvals.” The BBA maintains its certification of Reynobond PE unconditionally, even after the company itself limited the product’s future sale. “We have been attempting to contact the certificate holder to clarify certain facts and we will review our position in light of that information,” the BBA said in a statement. I found other high-rise structures outfitted with Reynobond PE, including a popular oceanfront hotel in the Middle East. I asked hotel management, the builder, and architect if they planned any structural modifications for the benefit of hotel guests and employees. None responded. Arconic’s Reynobond PE veneer formed only the most visible layer of Grenfell Tower’s beautifying mask. Under it, were foam plastic panels produced by French manufacturer Saint-Gobain

                                   , also produced insulation that found its way into the project, though the company issued a statement expressing doubt that cladding with a polyethylene core and plastic insulation “would ever pass” appropriate fire-performance tests. By the time Arconic restricted sales of Reynobond PE 12 days after the fire, company shares had fallen 13%, and bottomed the next day—down 21%—before rebounding. Arconic offered “deepest condolences” and “full support to the authorities as they conduct their investigations,” along with blame-mitigating expressions common among other contractors and suppliers: it was “not involved in the installation” at Grenfell Tower, “other parts of the cladding system, including the insulation, were supplied by other parties” and “we sold our products with the expectation that they would be used in compliance with … local building codes and regulations” and “we don’t control the overall system or its compliance.” And yet Arconic marketing materials state: “When we designed Reynobond panels, we made sure they could take the heat.” Any consumer might understand that as attesting to product safety. It appears under the header, “Safety. One of our core values.” Apparently, that isn’t what the company meant. Not all Reynobond panels can take the heat—at least not in the sense of being fire-proof. “That’s why they are also available with a fire-resistant core that meets or exceeds international building code requirements,” the marketing materials explain. Arconic cladding is associated with other questionable “fire safety” language in marketing materials published by the European Aluminium Association. The association, of which Arconic is a member, states: “Industrial roofs and external walls are increasingly being made of thin aluminium cladding panels, intended to melt during a major fire, allowing heat and smoke to escape and thereby minimizing the damage.” This publication identifies Alcoa Architectural Products, now part of Arconic, as a sponsor, and credits it with contributing some of the images in the pamphlet. The language promoting product performance in a blaze is identified as “section 2.9. FIRE SAFETY.” Given anecdotal accounts that Grenfell Tower cladding served as a flue that contributed to the rapid spread of fire, heat, and fumes, I asked Aurelie Pattyn, a spokeswoman for the European Aluminium Association in Brussels, to explain the association’s statement that cladding allows “heat and smoke to escape … thereby minimizing the damage.” Pattyn responded: “The publication you refer to is indeed not specific on fire safety and focused on many different aspects of sustainability of buildings.” Even today, Arconic recommends a non-fire-resistant form of another walling product called curtain wall, which combines glass and aluminum, to customers who don’t want added fire safety in their high-rise hospitals, hotels, and residential towers around the world. I was told curtain wall is fundamentally different than cladding, with its own guidelines for installation and use. And I was told it would be inaccurate to conclude that guidance applicable to one high-rise product (cladding) extended to any other (curtain wall). Virendra Kumar Paul, head of the department of building engineering and management in the School of Planning and Architecture in New Delhi, told me it’s “very unlikely” that fire-resistant cladding is widely installed in India, where such veneers are “used quite extensively in high rises of all sorts.” “It is safe to infer,” he added, “the use and the installation is unprofessional, and safety not the consideration.” John Cowley, the managing director of a British building-products firm called CEP Architectural Facades, which custom-cut the aluminum panels for Grenfell Tower, says fires in 2010 and 2012 at two other aluminum-clad buildings with mineral-fiber rather than plastic insulation didn’t spread. Yet someone decided non-fire-resistant aluminum cladding—with a combustible plastic core and plastic-foam insulation—was good enough at Grenfell Tower. “Where are the arrests?” asks the British writer Andrew Chapman, who has written about the tragedy from an engineering standpoint. “The regulations were breached, there are several clear culprits, many died. …. It’s not that complicated, surely?” Meaningful standards and oversight should have been as important for the construction workers, building-products manufacturers, landlords, safety inspectors, police, and fire at Grenfell Tower as for the deceased victims.

465,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"But the results come amid uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare industry with Republican lawmakers seeking to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Republican President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off about $8 billion in subsidies that help control costs for low-income Americans under the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare. Tampa, Florida-based WellCare, which focuses on government-backed Medicare and Medicaid plans, said Medicaid memberships increased 16.6 percent to 2.83 million as of June 30, helped mainly by higher enrolments in Missouri. Memberships surged 46 percent in WellCare’s Medicare business and by 10.3 percent in its Medicare prescription drug plans business. The amount WellCare spent on medical claims out of the premiums it earned, a key measure of costs known as medical benefits ratio (MBR), rose in the Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The lower the ratio, the better for the insurer. WellCare said its MBR deteriorated to 86.8 percent in Medicaid and to 86.4 percent in Medicare. The company has been trying to bolster its Medicare Advantage business to offset any likely hit from a possible repeal and replace of Obamacare. It bought smaller rival Universal American Corp for $600 million in April. Piper Jaffray analysts said on Friday such investments position WellCare for a lower MBR and better profit margins over the long term. WellCare’s net income fell to $74.1 million, or $1.65 per share in the second quarter, from $90.8 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, WellCare earned $2.52 per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of $2.24, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 19.8 percent to $4.31 billion. Analysts had expected $4.2 billion. The company raised its 2017 earnings forecast to $6.75 to $6.95 per share from $6.55 to $6.80 per share. WellCare’s shares have climbed about 33 percent this year. (In paragraph 13, this story corrects revenue number to $4.31 billion from $4.1 billion; the error also appeared in an earlier version of the story) ","

466,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Fifteen aid groups on Wednesday called on warring parties in Yemen to reopen the country’s main airport, saying a year-long closure was hindering aid and preventing thousands of patients from flying abroad for life-saving treatment. Yemen has been torn apart by a civil war in which the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by a Saudi-led military coalition, is trying to push back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group. The Houthis control most of the north, including the capital Sanaa and its international airport while the Saudi-led coalition controls the airspace. Any reopening would need an agreement between the two sides, which blame each other for Yemen’s humanitarian disaster. “The official closure of Sanaa airport, one year ago today, effectively traps millions of Yemeni people and serves to prevent the free movement of commercial and humanitarian goods,” the statement signed by groups including the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council said. Yemen has had more than 400,000 suspected cases of cholera in the past three months in an epidemic that has killed 1,900 people, the World Health Organization said in late July. The aid groups said: “The current cholera outbreak and near-famine conditions in many parts of Yemen make the situation far worse. The importance of unhampered delivery of humanitarian aid cannot be overstated.” Yemen’s health ministry estimates that 10,000 Yemenis have died from critical health conditions for which they were seeking international medical treatment, the statement said, adding it was unable to verify the figure. It said this was roughly equivalent to the number of people that have died as a direct result of the fighting and represented the hidden victims of the conflict. Citing United Nations figures, the statement said an estimated 7,000 Yemenis had gone abroad from Sanaa each year for medical treatment before the conflict. Now the number needing life-saving healthcare was around 20,000 Yemenis over the past two years because of the violence, it said. “Yemenis awaiting critical medical treatment abroad now have to find alternative routes to leave the country, which include a 10-20 hour drive to other airports, often through areas where active fighting takes place,” the statement added.

467,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"With John McCain’s dramatic “no” vote, the Health Care Freedom Act (HFCA) died early last Friday morning and with it any hope of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for the foreseeable future. While conservatives might prefer to blame incompetent vote-whipping in the Senate, the ACA could prove resilient for the same reason Medicare and Social Security have: most voters prefer not to wonder if they will be able to eat when hungry or see a doctor when sick. Any program that gives more economic security to a broad, politically powerful group will be dangerous to meddle with, even in these polarized times. Conservative activists and pundits who don’t want to contend with that reality may point to the president they were dealt: Donald Trump knew essentially nothing about health care and he alternated between disengagement and crude bullying of wavering senators ahead of the vote. Blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is less convincing. McConnell is a masterful legislative strategist and it took his maneuvering to bring a bill supported by less than 30 percent of the public to within one vote of passing. Indeed, McConnell may only have come even that close because he skipped the normal committee hearing process, protecting the proposal from more public and media scrutiny. The real lesson here is that once major social programs are in place, it’s simply very hard to eliminate them. In his 1994 book “Dismantling the Welfare State?”, the political scientist Paul Pierson showed that major social welfare programs were very resilient, and conservative attempts to repeal them generally failed. This was true even in parliamentary systems with fewer choke points to stop repeal than the American system. In the United States, the clearest example is Social Security. Before becoming president, Ronald Reagan had repeatedly expressed a desire to make it a voluntary program, but he quickly abandoned any thoughts of radically restructuring the program after taking office. Instead he oversaw a bipartisan plan to protect the program’s solvency through a combination of regressive tax increases and benefit cuts. When the Republican controlled-Senate narrowly passed a one-year freeze to seniors’ annual cost-of-living adjustment freeze during Reagan’s second term, the president abandoned the unpopular proposal, letting it die in the House of Representatives. George W. Bush, after winning re-election in 2004, made Social Security privatization his signature domestic issue. Bush travelled the country, making the case for a system of voluntary private accounts to partially replace Social Security for young workers. But the idea was politically toxic, actually becoming less popular the more Bush discussed it. Congressional Democrats, who had collaborated with Republicans on major domestic legislation during Bush’s first term, came out against the proposal en masse. Republicans controlled both houses of Congress but they refused to take responsibility for highly unpopular changes to a cherished program. No Social Security privatization bill came close to a vote. Republicans have not actively pursued the goal since. Nor have Republicans had any success at attacking the Great Society’s cornerstone health policy, Medicare. Sometimes they actively go in the opposite direction. In George W. Bush’s first term, Bush worked with Republicans to pass a corporate-friendly expansion of Medicare to partially cover payments for prescription drugs. Tea Party activists consider this one of the Bush era’s major betrayals of small government conservatism. But even arch-conservatives like Rick Santorum voted for the law. The politics were irrefutable: senior citizens vote, mostly Republican, and they fill a lot of prescriptions. In 2011, now-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposed a plan to convert Medicare into a system in which seniors received vouchers (whose value would decrease over time) to purchase health insurance on private markets. The proposal was extremely unpopular and created a major backlash. Ryan has never officially abandoned some form of vouchers as a goal, but he has not put any Medicare restructuring on his legislative agenda since taking the Speaker’s gavel. The Ryan budget’s threat to Medicare, however, proves a reliably spooky specter for Democrats to invoke when sending fundraising emails or appealing to older swing voters. Social programs are often not fully appreciated by their beneficiaries until someone proposes getting rid of them. Facing an existential threat made the Affordable Care Act much more popular – as then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi predicted, support for it increased once people found out what was in it. The Republican proposals to replace the ACA, conversely, are staggeringly unpopular. As recently as last year, more Americans disapproved of the ACA than supported it, but its approval ratings are now over 50 percent, while the repeal bills started out unpopular and became more so. The majority support for the ACA wasn’t soft, either. Supporters of the ACA were far more motivated than its opponents during the repeal struggle, putting their time and sometimes their bodies on the line, such as when disabled people were ejected from the offices of members of Congress. This helps to explain why moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (not to mention Democratic senators representing states that Trump won in landslides such as West Virginia and Montana) were unwavering in their opposition. The weekend after the HCFA was voted down, Murkowsi was repeatedly greeted by supporters, some in tears, thanking her for her no vote, while Nevada Senator Dean Heller was rewarded for his “yes” vote by seeing his approval rating plummet to 22 percent. This doesn’t mean that supporters of the ACA should be complacent. Even when Republicans have failed to eliminate major social programs, they have been able to make them less generous in ways that caused real harm, Reagan’s Social Security adjustment included. Trump is signaling that he will damage the ACA administratively, and 19 states are still refusing the ACA’s generous Medicaid expansion. Moreover, the failure to eliminate major welfare programs is a tendency, not an iron law. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed a welfare “reform” bill that led to more than 6 million mothers with children losing welfare benefits. That was possible partly because welfare, unlike Obamacare, only benefits the poor, who are politically disempowered. Still, Republicans just came closer to passing a partial repeal of the ACA than many would have thought possible. The battle over healthcare is far from over, but the repeated failures of the GOP efforts to repeal it prove the political durability of the social safety net.

468,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A top United Nations official in Yemen said reported airstrikes in which at least 12 civilians were killed, including children, were an example of the “disregard” for civilians’ safety shown by all the combatants in Yemen’s civil war. The civilians were killed and 10 others wounded in Sa’ada province after attacks on a house and a private vehicle, the U.N.’s Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said, citing reports from fellow aid groups. Reuters reported on Friday that three women and six children from the same family were killed in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on their home in the area, according to a local health official. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to a request for a comment. Yemen has been torn apart by a civil war in which the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to push back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of the north, including the capital Sanaa. The new incidents were an example of the “brutality” of the conflict, McGoldrick said in the statement in which he expressed deep concern. “All parties to the conflict continue to show a disregard  for the protection of civilians and the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in the conduct of hostilities.” Saada, a stronghold of the Houthi group, has been repeatedly hit by air strikes since the coalition of Arab states joined the civil war in March 2015. They see the war as an attempt by Iran to expand its influence in Yemen. ","

In a statement drafted by Sweden, the 15-member council expressed “deep concern that ongoing conflicts and violence have devastating humanitarian consequences and hinder an effective humanitarian response in the short, medium and long term, and are therefore a major cause of famine” in these four countries. “The Security Council calls upon all parties in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeast Nigeria to urgently take steps that would enable a more effective humanitarian response,” the statement said. The United Nations appealed in February for $4.9 billion to combat what it calls the largest humanitarian crisis since the world body was formed more than 70 years ago, but U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said only 51 percent of that amount has been received. “These four contexts are very different but one thing is in common - they are all affected by conflict, they are manmade and also the humanitarian access is hampered by the ongoing conflict,” Sweden’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau told reporters. The statement also asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to brief the Security Council in October on impediments to responding to the risk of famine in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeastern Nigeria and make recommendations on how to overcome any obstacles. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said famine was an issue of peace and security. “The Security Council has finally acknowledged the clear link between conflict and famine,” she said in a statement. Yemen has been embroiled in conflict for several years with Iran-allied Houthi rebels fighting Yemeni government forces backed by a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition. South Sudan plunged into civil war in 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy Riek Machar, while in northeastern Nigeria, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram is targeting military and civilians. Somalia has been at war since 1991, when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. Al Qaeda-affiliated militant group al Shabaab has since gained a foothold in the country during the chaos. ","

471,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) By Mark Miller CHICAGO (Reuters) - If you are hovering around retirement age today, you will be closing in on your eighties in the year 2030. With any luck, you will be healthy and mobile - but imagine for a moment that you are not. Let’s say a debilitating illness requires that you receive care in a nursing home. It is an unsettling future to imagine. But now ask yourself this - who will take care of you? The United States is headed toward a severe shortage of caregivers - paid and unpaid - in the decades ahead, according to human resources expert Paul Osterman. A professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, Osterman is the author of a new book, “Who Will Care for Us: Long-term Care and the Long-Term Workforce” (Russell Sage Foundation, 2017), which examines trends in the labor force market for caregivers. His conclusion? “It’s an absolute train wreck waiting to happen.” Our aging population will push up demand, although Osterman notes that roughly half of demand for care will come from younger, disabled people. He examines the projected rising demand for care in the coming decades, and then matches up the demand side with trends in the labor force for paid certified nursing assistants (CNAs) and home care workers, including the availability of unpaid family and friends - the most common source of care for many people. He finds that in 2030 there will be a national shortage of 151,000 paid direct care workers and 3.8 million unpaid family caregivers. By 2040, the shortfall will be much larger: 355,000 paid workers, and the family and friends shortfall will be a shocking 11 million. “These are conservative estimates,” Osterman said in an interview. “They assume no changes in immigration policies, and that family members will be willing to provide care at the same rate they do today - that’s not likely, due to smaller families and more geographic dispersion.” If family caregivers become more scarce, that can only put further pressure on demand for paid care. The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in the United States will only worsen the situation. In 2015, 18 percent of CNAs and 27 percent of home care aides were immigrants, Osterman estimated, citing Census data. Among immigrant home aides, 24 percent each come from Central America and Asia, 23 percent come from the Caribbean and 10 percent are from Africa. But he cautions that the impact of a shrinking immigrant labor pool will be uneven, due to the huge variation in immigration patterns among the states. “New York and California have very large immigrant populations, but it would probably have very little impact in a state like Ohio,” he said. The highest percentages of home care aides who are immigrants are found in New York (64 percent), New Jersey (47 percent) California (46 percent), Florida (38 percent) and Texas (22 percent). By contrast, just 8 percent of the home care aide workforce in Ohio are immigrants; in Georgia, the figure is 12 percent. Osterman also does not believe a crackdown on undocumented workers would affect the caregiving labor market much. Young men make up a very large part of the undocumented population and nationally, nearly 90 percent of direct care workers are female. “Undocumented workers as a group are unlikely to be a dominant source of labor for these jobs,” he said. Caregivers earn very low wages - median income for CNAs in 2015 was $20,000, and home care aides earned a median of $15,000, according to Census data. Normally, a labor shortage would resolve itself by putting upward pressure on wages - which would bring more workers into the field. But in this case, the impact on wages - and the caregiving shortage - will be uneven, Osterman said. Two-thirds of long-term care in the United States is funded by the federal Medicaid program, with the remainder paid through private commercial insurance or out of pocket. Medicaid payment policies vary widely among the states, but Osterman worries that in many states, care facilities funded by cash-strapped Medicaid programs will not be able to boost wages. “It’s difficult for wages to rise because they are set bureaucratically according to Medicaid reimbursement rates,” he said. Meanwhile, wages in the high-end private payer market will rise, with a corresponding impact on the cost of care and insurance. Osterman’s book is not completely doom and gloom. He holds out hope that we can attract more workers to caregiving by making the occupation more attractive. One needed change, he said, is attitudinal. Many key actors in the profession - doctors, hospitals, regulators, legislators and insurance companies - simply do not demonstrate respect for direct care workers, which is an obstacle to improving the job. The second challenge, he writes, is the complexity of our care delivery system and its financing mechanisms, both of which make reforms difficult to implement. Osterman also argues for restructuring the roles of caregivers. Currently, new caregiving workers receive only about two weeks of job training; expanding that could open the door to broader responsibilities. “In some states, a caregiver can’t administer eye drops, or help with wound care,” he said. He thinks caregiving workers could be trained to help with responsibilities like physical therapy, or coaching people with diabetes on eating and exercise. That could attract more workers, he thinks, and save money in the healthcare system by shifting tasks away from higher-paid workers such as nurses. “The point of my book is not to be nice,” he said. “It’s really a financial case for doing this, and an argument for an important social policy.” ","

472,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Discount supermarket chain Aldi is withdrawing all eggs from sale at its more than 4,000 stores in Germany as a precaution, it said on Friday, as a scare over the possible contamination of eggs with insecticide spreads. Traces of insecticide fipronil were found in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands last month, which has led to the temporary shut-down of some poultry farms and to supermarkets halting the sale of eggs from the Netherlands. Fipronil is considered by the World Health Organization to be moderately toxic, with high doses leading to feelings of nausea and dizziness. Very large quantities can cause damage to the kidneys, liver and lymph glands. German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt said the likelihood of a health hazard was very unlikely, but German state authorities were working to examine all egg supplies and determine where they originated or were processed. “The situation is under control, but we cannot give the all-clear signal yet ... We are taking this very seriously,” Schmidt told the Straubinger Tagblatt/Landshuter Zeitung newspaper group. He urged consumers to check any already purchased eggs against lists of affected supplies that were available online. Investigators suspect the chemical may have gotten into eggs through a contaminated detergent against mites called Dega 16 that is used to clean barns, and criminal investigations have been launched in both Belgium and the Netherlands. The Netherlands is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter after the United States and sells around 5 billion eggs a year to Germany. The detergent was also supplied to farms in the northern German state of Lower Saxony, from where eggs were distributed across the country, Lower Saxony’s agriculture ministry said. Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said this week only a limited type of egg, recognizable by specific serial numbers, posed a risk. Nonetheless, around 180 poultry companies in the Netherlands have been temporarily closed, and some firms have culled their flock. A number of supermarket chains including Germany’s REWE and Penny have taken Dutch eggs off their shelves. Aldi is the first major retailer to halt all egg sales, regardless of origin. “This is merely a precaution, there is no reason to assume there are any health risks,” Aldi North and Aldi South, the two operators of Aldi stores, said in a joint statement on Friday. Aldi South’s 190 stores in Switzerland have stopped the sale of imported eggs, Aldi Suisse said in a separate statement. The Dutch organisation of food retailers CBL said on Friday all possibly contaminated eggs would be removed from the shelves of supermarkets in the Netherlands. Public prosecutors in Belgium and the Netherlands are investigating poultry service providers that are suspected of having added Dega 16 to their products, the European Commission said, without providing further details.

473,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemeni troops and armor have pushed al Qaeda militants out of main cities in Shabwa, residents said on Friday, regaining government control over the southern province for the first time in years. They said al Qaeda militants withdrew to the mountains without a fight as armored vehicles from the government army and a new force known as the Elite Shabwa Forces rolled into the provincial capital Ataq, and other towns and cities from Thursday morning. United Arab Emirates news agency WAM said on Thursday the advance had been backed by the United States and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) but it did not specify what support they had provided. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has taken advantage of the civil war pitting the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi against the Houthi movement to try to widen its control and influence in Yemen. In a separate incident in the parallel war, three women and six children from the same family were killed in an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on their home in northern Yemen on Friday, a health official said. The conflicts have killed more than 10,000 people,  displaced millions and created a humanitarian crisis, including a cholera epidemic and widespread famine. The Shabwa operation marked the first time in years that government-backed forces had controlled all districts in the province, where Yemen’s biggest gas project, a $4.5 billion Total-led plant, is based. The terminal stopped operating after foreign experts were evacuated in 2015 but the government says it plans to get the facility working again. Large-scale ground operations by regional troops have been rare since 2015, when al Qaeda was driven out of the mini-state it had established in the port city of Mukalla, capital of neighboring Hadramout province. But air strikes by U.S. drones and aircraft against the militant group are frequent. The U.S. military carried out an air strike in Shabwa in June that killed Abu Khattab al-Awlaqi, one of the emirs of AQAP, along with two other militants. Operations against the militants are complicated by the civil war, in which the Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthi fighters and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in a campaign to restore Hadi’s internationally recognized government, now based in the southern port city of Aden. The forces are largely stalemated. In Friday’s air strike in north Yemen, the head of the local health department, Dr Abdel-Ilah al-Azzi, said the attack on a home in Mahda district in the southwestern outskirts of Saada, killed three women and six children and wounded three people. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to a request for a comment. It was not clear if the house was hit by mistake, but the coalition says it does not target civilians. A relative, who declined to be identified, said the attack happened before dawn while the family slept. Pictures from the scene showed the house completely destroyed by the strike. Residents who rushed to the scene were afraid to start rescue work while aircraft hovered overhead. Saada, a Houthi stronghold , has been repeatedly hit by air strikes since the coalition of Arab states joined the civil war in March 2015. They see the war as an attempt by Iran to expand its influence in Yemen. At least 25 Yemenis were killed in June when coalition aircraft struck a market in Saada province. In March, a coalition air strike killed 22 people and wounded dozens in a market in western Yemen near the Red Sea fishing town of Khoukha. In December, the coalition acknowledged it had made “limited use” of British-made cluster bombs, but said it had stopped using them. ","

474, ,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"Supported by TOKYO — Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies. The factory’s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said. Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump’s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States. Mixing appeals, rebukes and state-sponsored enticements, Mr. Trump has pushed both American and foreign-owned companies to locate factories in the United States rather than in lower-wage countries. Even before Mr. Trump was sworn in, the heating and cooling giant Carrier agreed to cut the number of jobs it planned to move to Mexico from an Indiana plant after the state added $7 million in incentives. Last week, the Taiwanese electronics supplier Foxconn joined Mr. Trump at the White House to announce its plans to locate a new plant with 3,000 positions in Wisconsin, which lured the company with a staggering $3 billion in state tax credits. The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. “Toyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!” he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a “big border tax.” The alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology. In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts — especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars — many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world’s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development. “In the future, mobility won’t belong only to carmakers,” Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution. “Totally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,” Mr. Toyoda said. “We need to cooperate and compete with them.” Japan’s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew. Mitsubishi joined the Renault-Nissan alliance last year, after the French-Japanese group extended Mitsubishi a $2.2 billion lifeline to help it recover from a scandal over falsified fuel-economy ratings. Toyota has been extending its reach, as well. Last year, it took over its longtime minicar affiliate, Daihatsu. It has also been strengthening its links with Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, in which Toyota owns a 16.5 percent stake. And it has been discussing a new partnership with Suzuki. Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership. With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges — both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla. Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company’s products more flair. Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda’s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent. According to a Toyota fact sheet, the company has directly invested $23.4 billion in the United States, has 10 plants, and employs 136,000 people. Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion. “As Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi’s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,” said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers. Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. “Any manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,” Gov. Rick Snyder said. “We are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.” And a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: “Toyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas — just recently opening their new North American headquarters — and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.” An earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion. Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner.

475, ,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"* Plant to produce Toyota Corollas, new Mazda SUV crossover * To develop electric vehicle technologies * Trump says plan a “great investment in American manufacturing” * Toyota to take 5 pct stake in Mazda; Mazda 0.25 pct in Toyota (Adds details from press conference, Trump comment) By Naomi Tajitsu and Sam Nussey TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it planned to take a 5 percent share of smaller Japanese rival Mazda Motor Corp, as part of an alliance that will see the two build a $1.6 billion U.S. assembly plant and work together on electric vehicles. The plant was a surprise for investors at a time of cooling U.S. sales, but marked good news for U.S. President Donald Trump who came to office on the back of promises to bring back manufacturing and jobs for U.S. workers. He commented on Twitter that it was a “great investment in American manufacturing”. The plant, whose location is not yet public, will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles a year, with production divided between the two automakers, and employ about 4,000 people. It will start operating in 2021. Analysts said the plan was more than a political ploy. The alliance is also an attempt to catch up with rivals in the race for electric car technology, as tighter global emissions rules loom, along with the entry of new players into the market. “There will be new rivals appearing - Apple, Google - these are IT companies, we also need to compete with them, too,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the company’s founder, told a news conference in Tokyo. He was appointed last year to lead Toyota’s newly formed electric car division, flagging the group’s commitment to a technology it has been slow to embrace. “What’s different from the past is that there are no nautical charts for us to follow. It’s without precedent,” he said of the push into alternatives to the internal combustion engine. Other traditional automakers such as Daimler and BMW are also weighing how best to work on new, disruptive technology, from electric vehicles to autonomous driving, that require hefty investment and have turned firms like Google and Tesla into rivals. Toyota has set a goal for all of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. But until recently, it has said it favoured EVs for short-distance commuting, given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), while rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. As part of the agreement, as well as electric car technology, Toyota and Mazda will work together to develop in-car information technologies and automated driving functions. Toyota, Japan’s biggest auto company, has been forging alliances with smaller rivals for several years, effectively engineering a loose network at the heart of the Japanese auto sector. It already owns a 16.5 percent stake in sixth-ranked Subaru Corp with which it also has a development partnership. Toyota is also courting compact car maker Suzuki Motor Corp to cooperate on R&D and parts supply, as Toyota seeks to tap its smaller rival’s expertise in emerging Asian markets. As part of Friday’s plan, Toyota, the world’s second-largest automaker by vehicle sales last year, will take a 5 percent share of Mazda, and Mazda will take a 0.25 percent share of Toyota. Mazda said it could even expand the alliance, as long as it could stay in control of its own management. “We will study the possibility of expanding the capital alliance, but the basic premise is that autonomy is assured,” said Mazda Executive Vice President Akira Marumoto. A stake in Mazda may also prevent future incursions by tech companies, one analyst said. “For a technology company which lacks the expertise in making cars, Mazda could look like a very interesting acquisition. They’re very good, they’re not too expensive. Maybe Toyota realises this,” CLSA managing director Chris Richter said. “By buying a 5 percent stake, Toyota takes Mazda off the table rather than having it sit out there like a free agent which could someday be used against them.” Mazda, for its part, stands to gain from a deal that gives the small automaker a production foothold in the United States. At the moment, it ships all vehicles sold in the country, its biggest market, from its plants in Japan and Mexico. With an R&D budget of around 140 billion yen ($1.27 billion) this year, a fraction of Toyota’s 1 trillion yen, Mazda lacks the funds to develop electric cars on its own, a predicament shared by Subaru and Suzuki. “Mazda needs electrification technology. In the past, they’ve pooh-poohed EVs, they’ve felt they can make internal combustion engines more efficient, but the bottom line is that globally you need to have this technology,” said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities. The automakers plan to produce Toyota Corollas and a new Mazda SUV crossover at the new plant, and the companies said they could eventually build other cars including electric vehicles. Toyota initially had been planning to produce Corollas at its new $1 billion plant being built in Mexico, prompting Trump to threaten punitive tariffs. The company has since said it will instead produce its Tacoma truck model in Mexico. ","

476,,8102017,Investopedia,8032017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A bonus is any financial compensation, reward, or return over and above the normal expectations of the recipient. A bonus can be given to a company’s employees and executives, prospective employees, or shareholders. In workplace settings, a bonus is compensation given to an employee in addition to his/her normal wage. A bonus can be used as a reward for achieving specific goals set by the company, or for dedication to the company – or even to join the company. Examples of bonuses that are offered as an incentive include sign-on bonuses, referral bonuses, and retention bonuses. A sign-on bonus is a monetary offer to prospective employees who are perceived to be top talents. The bonus is meant to incentivize the potential hire to accept a company’s offer of employment over another firm’s offer. The initial payment is designed to entice the signing of an agreement that will cost the company more now for higher future benefits. Professional sport teams, for example, often offer bonuses to highly skilled players they're seeking to sign. A referral bonus is given to an employee whose recommendation of a person for an open position with the company leads to the hiring of that person. Companies offer referral bonuses to their top performers to refer people whom the employees can vouch for in terms of great work ethics, high skills, and positive attitudes. If the recommended individual ends up getting the job, the recommender will be given a bonus. Companies offer retention bonuses to key employees to encourage them to stay with the company, especially during stressful periods or during organizational changes. The financial incentive seeks to provide assurance management values their contributions with the company and would like to retain them. A bonus may also be offered to employees as a reward for some exceptional work that has been done and completed. A performance bonus is offered when a project, quarter, or year has successfully been completed; when a team or employee goes above and beyond the required job responsibilities; or when special recognition is to be given to an employee. The bonus can be given to an individual, a team, a department, or everyone in the company according to each entity’s contribution. A reward bonus may be a one-time offer or may be a periodic payment. Reward bonuses are not always cash. Sometimes they are paid out in kind in the form of stocks, gift cards, a day off, a holiday turkey, or simply just a verbal appreciation. Examples of bonuses given to an employee for a job well-done include the annual bonus scheme, spot bonus award, employee appreciation award, gain sharing bonus and milestone bonus. Some businesses have an annual bonus structure built into employees’ contracts. In the event that the firm makes a profit during its fiscal year of operation, the profit will be shared amongst the employees, with executives in the C-Suite getting a larger piece of the pie. The spot bonus award is a micro-bonus payment, typically valued at around $50, given to an employee or team that deserves special recognition. The employee appreciation bonus could also fall under the spot bonus scheme or it could be its own separate award plan given to an exceptional employee. Workers who reach a milestone with the firm, say 10 years of employment, may also be recognized with additional compensation in cash or kind. Not all bonuses are offered as an incentive or a reward. Some bonus payments made out to employees are not earned,and are given only because the individual is part of the company. Example of a just-because bonus is the holiday bonus, which ranges from payments in cash or kind to all employees to an extra month's salary in addition to the salary for 12 months already received. In general, people assume that workplace bonuses are issued to reward workers who have adequate and above-average performance levels, and whose work benefits the company and generates more profit. You'd think a manager who pays bonuses to certain individuals on a lackluster team would likely need to explain his actions both to his boss and to the team members who didn’t receive bonuses. However, recent studies indicate that close to 25% of all North American managers issue bonuses or some type of financial rewards to even the lower-performing employees. This includes those who fail to meet performance expectations. One study, conducted by Towers Watson Talent Management and Rewards Pulse Survey, also indicated that just short of 20% of these managers do not set any differences in target payouts based on employee performances. Research reveals that businesses that reward all staff, disregarding performance, generally tend to grow more slowly and in many cases end up generating less money. Lack of successful and effective management of employee performance typically causes companies to lose profits. However, the majority of businesses in the United States are still rewarding mediocre employees, and there are a number of reasons why. Performance-based bonus systems, particularly those that are extremely restrictive, cause substantial headaches, mainly in the shape of staffer complaints, lower morale and anger – taken out on management, colleagues and sometimes even on customers and clients. As a result, bonuses are often issued to even the poorest-performing workers, to avoid dealing with backlash: It's simply easier to pay bonuses to all employees. This allows management to avoid discussing inadequate performances with employees and explaining why they weren't given bonuses, or were given smaller bonuses than their better-performing co-workers. Even chief executive officers (CEOs) who have tried to implement strictly numbers-based reward-and-punishment bonus systems have found great difficulty in doing so. Then too, it is often difficult to judge the rate of performance, even when using ""objective"" measures. For example, judging an employee on his failure to meet a certain quota or deadline is not always a good indicator of how hard the employee is working or how valuable he is to the company: The worker may be struggling against unavoidable production delays or downward trends in the economy. Finally, some companies may try to use bonuses not as a reward for good work in the past year, but as an incentive for better work in the future – in effect, a bribe to boost workers' overall performances going forward. There's another reason every worker might receive, or at least be promised, a bonus. Within the past decade or so, companies have increasingly been replacing raises in salary partially or entirely with bonuses, a change affecting everyone from the senior executives to the secretaries and assistants. It's a cost-saving measure that, according to Aon Hewitt’s 2014 Salary Increase Survey, companies across the United States are now using in record numbers, much to the detriment of the employees. Employers keep wages and wage increases low by promising to fill the gap with bonuses; when bonus time comes, though – traditionally, at the end of the year – there’s no obligation to actually pay out. Because employers pay bonuses on a discretionary basis, they’re able to keep their fixed costs low by shifting heavily to a bonus system. Such variable pay can be adjusted to suit the economic health of the company and, in slow years, can be written off entirely. Compare this to a company that increases salaries every year and then tries to cut wages during a recession. It rarely happens. The increased control over wages has additional benefits aside from its flexibility. For starters, wage increases, once implemented, grow exponentially as each year’s increase is based off of the previous year’s salary. What’s more, Social Security, payroll taxes and pension contributions are all based on salary: Save on salary costs, save on benefit costs. It’s a win-win for any organization. Another unnerving statistic is the amount in bonuses that are actually given out, specifically to top-performing employees. According to recent studies, American companies have just over 85% of the money they previously earmarked to be available for bonuses for their employees. Since 2005, U.S. companies have only had 100% of bonus funds available to reward employees twice – in 2006 and in 2010. In addition to employees, shareholders may also receive a bonus as a return on their investment with the company. One type of shareholder bonus is dividends, which are paid to shareholders from funds created out of profits realized by the company. The board of directors has to approve dividend payments, and can also decide to stop the payments at its discretion. A company can also issue bonus shares to shareholders, thereby increasing the total number of shares issued and owned. A bonus issue is usually based on the number of shares already owned by the shareholder, and is very similar to a stock split, except that no splits occur with bonus shares and the figures in the Shareholders' Equity section of the balance sheet changes.

477,,8102017,Investopedia,8032017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A bonus is any financial compensation, reward, or return over and above the normal expectations of the recipient. A bonus can be given to a company’s employees and executives, prospective employees, or shareholders. In workplace settings, a bonus is compensation given to an employee in addition to his/her normal wage. A bonus can be used as a reward for achieving specific goals set by the company, or for dedication to the company – or even to join the company. Examples of bonuses that are offered as an incentive include sign-on bonuses, referral bonuses, and retention bonuses. A sign-on bonus is a monetary offer to prospective employees who are perceived to be top talents. The bonus is meant to incentivize the potential hire to accept a company’s offer of employment over another firm’s offer. The initial payment is designed to entice the signing of an agreement that will cost the company more now for higher future benefits. Professional sport teams, for example, often offer bonuses to highly skilled players they're seeking to sign. A referral bonus is given to an employee whose recommendation of a person for an open position with the company leads to the hiring of that person. Companies offer referral bonuses to their top performers to refer people whom the employees can vouch for in terms of great work ethics, high skills, and positive attitudes. If the recommended individual ends up getting the job, the recommender will be given a bonus. Companies offer retention bonuses to key employees to encourage them to stay with the company, especially during stressful periods or during organizational changes. The financial incentive seeks to provide assurance management values their contributions with the company and would like to retain them. A bonus may also be offered to employees as a reward for some exceptional work that has been done and completed. A performance bonus is offered when a project, quarter, or year has successfully been completed; when a team or employee goes above and beyond the required job responsibilities; or when special recognition is to be given to an employee. The bonus can be given to an individual, a team, a department, or everyone in the company according to each entity’s contribution. A reward bonus may be a one-time offer or may be a periodic payment. Reward bonuses are not always cash. Sometimes they are paid out in kind in the form of stocks, gift cards, a day off, a holiday turkey, or simply just a verbal appreciation. Examples of bonuses given to an employee for a job well-done include the annual bonus scheme, spot bonus award, employee appreciation award, gain sharing bonus and milestone bonus. Some businesses have an annual bonus structure built into employees’ contracts. In the event that the firm makes a profit during its fiscal year of operation, the profit will be shared amongst the employees, with executives in the C-Suite getting a larger piece of the pie. The spot bonus award is a micro-bonus payment, typically valued at around $50, given to an employee or team that deserves special recognition. The employee appreciation bonus could also fall under the spot bonus scheme or it could be its own separate award plan given to an exceptional employee. Workers who reach a milestone with the firm, say 10 years of employment, may also be recognized with additional compensation in cash or kind. Not all bonuses are offered as an incentive or a reward. Some bonus payments made out to employees are not earned,and are given only because the individual is part of the company. Example of a just-because bonus is the holiday bonus, which ranges from payments in cash or kind to all employees to an extra month's salary in addition to the salary for 12 months already received. In general, people assume that workplace bonuses are issued to reward workers who have adequate and above-average performance levels, and whose work benefits the company and generates more profit. You'd think a manager who pays bonuses to certain individuals on a lackluster team would likely need to explain his actions both to his boss and to the team members who didn’t receive bonuses. However, recent studies indicate that close to 25% of all North American managers issue bonuses or some type of financial rewards to even the lower-performing employees. This includes those who fail to meet performance expectations. One study, conducted by Towers Watson Talent Management and Rewards Pulse Survey, also indicated that just short of 20% of these managers do not set any differences in target payouts based on employee performances. Research reveals that businesses that reward all staff, disregarding performance, generally tend to grow more slowly and in many cases end up generating less money. Lack of successful and effective management of employee performance typically causes companies to lose profits. However, the majority of businesses in the United States are still rewarding mediocre employees, and there are a number of reasons why. Performance-based bonus systems, particularly those that are extremely restrictive, cause substantial headaches, mainly in the shape of staffer complaints, lower morale and anger – taken out on management, colleagues and sometimes even on customers and clients. As a result, bonuses are often issued to even the poorest-performing workers, to avoid dealing with backlash: It's simply easier to pay bonuses to all employees. This allows management to avoid discussing inadequate performances with employees and explaining why they weren't given bonuses, or were given smaller bonuses than their better-performing co-workers. Even chief executive officers (CEOs) who have tried to implement strictly numbers-based reward-and-punishment bonus systems have found great difficulty in doing so. Then too, it is often difficult to judge the rate of performance, even when using ""objective"" measures. For example, judging an employee on his failure to meet a certain quota or deadline is not always a good indicator of how hard the employee is working or how valuable he is to the company: The worker may be struggling against unavoidable production delays or downward trends in the economy. Finally, some companies may try to use bonuses not as a reward for good work in the past year, but as an incentive for better work in the future – in effect, a bribe to boost workers' overall performances going forward. There's another reason every worker might receive, or at least be promised, a bonus. Within the past decade or so, companies have increasingly been replacing raises in salary partially or entirely with bonuses, a change affecting everyone from the senior executives to the secretaries and assistants. It's a cost-saving measure that, according to Aon Hewitt’s 2014 Salary Increase Survey, companies across the United States are now using in record numbers, much to the detriment of the employees. Employers keep wages and wage increases low by promising to fill the gap with bonuses; when bonus time comes, though – traditionally, at the end of the year – there’s no obligation to actually pay out. Because employers pay bonuses on a discretionary basis, they’re able to keep their fixed costs low by shifting heavily to a bonus system. Such variable pay can be adjusted to suit the economic health of the company and, in slow years, can be written off entirely. Compare this to a company that increases salaries every year and then tries to cut wages during a recession. It rarely happens. The increased control over wages has additional benefits aside from its flexibility. For starters, wage increases, once implemented, grow exponentially as each year’s increase is based off of the previous year’s salary. What’s more, Social Security, payroll taxes and pension contributions are all based on salary: Save on salary costs, save on benefit costs. It’s a win-win for any organization. Another unnerving statistic is the amount in bonuses that are actually given out, specifically to top-performing employees. According to recent studies, American companies have just over 85% of the money they previously earmarked to be available for bonuses for their employees. Since 2005, U.S. companies have only had 100% of bonus funds available to reward employees twice – in 2006 and in 2010. In addition to employees, shareholders may also receive a bonus as a return on their investment with the company. One type of shareholder bonus is dividends, which are paid to shareholders from funds created out of profits realized by the company. The board of directors has to approve dividend payments, and can also decide to stop the payments at its discretion. A company can also issue bonus shares to shareholders, thereby increasing the total number of shares issued and owned. A bonus issue is usually based on the number of shares already owned by the shareholder, and is very similar to a stock split, except that no splits occur with bonus shares and the figures in the Shareholders' Equity section of the balance sheet changes. Bonus plans are not limited to office employees and shareholders. Other stakeholders in the company’s supply chain may receive additional compensation, such as sign-on bonuses, from a company in order to close a deal or obtain a contract. ",Bonus,0.9998
478,Bertha Coombs,8102017,CNBC,8032017,"It's easy to think the nation's entire health insurance market is paralyzed by the nasty debate over Obamacare in Washington. But, while Congress battled over health reform this spring, the nation's largest health insurers racked up strong profits in the second quarter thanks partly to less exposure to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.  Combined, the nation's top six health insurers reported $6 billion in adjusted profits for the second quarter. That's up more about 29 percent from the same quarter a year ago — far outpacing the overall S&P 500 health care sector's growth of 8.5 percent for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.  ""A lot of the companies have downsized their exposure to the public exchanges,"" said health care equity analyst A.J. Rice, a managing director at UBS. ""The core business, which is providing coverage to large and mid-sized employers... and the established government programs, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care, have all done well."" Aetna, Humana and Cigna all saw adjusted earnings rise more than 45 percent from the year ago quarter, despite the fact that they continue to experience losses on Obamacare individual plans. Centene and UnitedHealth Group's adjusted profits were up roughly 25 percent from a year ago; Anthem was the laggard, with its earnings up just 2 percent.  The strong earnings are driving share gains, with all six of the top insurers' stocks hitting all-time highs this summer. The S&P 500 Managed Care sector is up 25 percent year to date.  What's driving insurer profits? One major tailwind has been their ability to control medical costs. Most see costs rising in the mid-single digit range again this year. Cigna, the nation's fifth largest health insurer, said that much of that is being driven by the changes in plan design in the large employer market, which covers nearly 180 million Americans.  ""They're seeing the benefit of this lower medical cost trend for their respective portfolio based upon the actions we're driving and continuing to drive for them,"" said Cigna CEO David Cordani on the company's second-quarter conference call. Though, Cordani noted that even within the individual exchange business, medical costs growth is trending better than the company expected. Analysts say that increasing use of high deductible plans is helping rein in medical spending, in part by driving down the use of hospital emergency rooms. A number of the hospital providers reported lower volumes this quarter.  ""It's not so much that (insurers are) getting great concession from hospitals,"" explained Rice. ""Employees have much more upfront costs... and maybe they're taking a look at some utilization."" The Medicaid and Medicare markets are increasingly driving insurer topline growth, and that is where the plans are setting their sights on expansion. Aetna now derives more than half of its revenue from government plans, and after abandoning its merger deal with Humana, the insurer is focused on growing its Medicare Advantage market share on its own in 2018 and 2019.  ""The general trend is growing the portion of health care claims that are directly or indirectly paid by the federal government,"" said health care ratings analyst Deep Banerjee, a director at S&P Global Ratings.  Beyond the appeal of the growing number of baby boomers aging into Medicare, Banerjee says the government health programs represent mature, more predictable markets for the large insurers, than the three-year old Obamacare program.  ""If you look at Medicare Advantage, it's a public-private partnership,"" said Banerjee. ""Even with a single payer in a public-private partnership, insurance companies are very involved in managing the costs, and actually running the program for the state or the federal government.""  And as state and federal officials governments look to cut costs in programs like Medicaid, they are increasingly turning to the insurers. That's not to say that the big insurers are not worried about the Obamacare market. Centene and Anthem are the largest national insurers on the exchanges, and both are still planning to offer plans next year, as is Cigna.  With 2018 open enrollment slated to begin in less than three months, large and small insurers are sweating whether the Trump administration will continue to pay cost-reduction subsidies for low-income enrollees and whether the health insurance tax will be reinstated next year. They are also watching to see whether a proposed bipartisan short-term stabilization plan floated by Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander will gain support when Congress returns from its August recess.  Yet, even before the ACA, large insurers have had a tougher time with the individual market than regional players.  ""This is a market they've never been able to break into very well,"" explained Rice, of UBS. ""They've found it really tough to find the right model."" Centene is among the few large insurers that is starting to manage its exchanges plans profitably. Some Blue Cross insurers are also starting to see cost trends on the exchanges stabilize, after raising rates to account for the older, sicker risk pool in the last year.  The industry argues that with more permanent reinsurance funding to offset losses on the most expensive consumers, similar to the Medicare program, the individual exchanges could find their footing, and consumers could begin to see better pricing.  But, it is a work in progress,"" said Banerjee.  And for now, most large insurers are finding it pays to wait it out, when it comes to Obamacare.

480,Sarah O'Brien,8102017,CNBC,8032017,"Employees at big companies should be prepared to pay 5 percent more for their health care next year. New results from an industry organization's annual study shows that large employers expect the total average per-employee cost for health insurance benefits — which includes premiums and out-of-pocket costs for employees and dependents — to rise in 2018 to $14,156 from $13,482 this year. With employers covering about 70 percent of that cost, the average worker will  pay 30 percent of the tab, or about $4,200. ""I think you'll see [the 5 percent rise] in premium increases,"" said Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Business Group on Health, which released the study this week. ""Most people will probably see minimal changes to deductibles and co-pays unless they move to a [higher-deductible] plan."" This marks the fifth consecutive year that health care costs are expected to rise by 5 percent, according to the study. That outpaces the rate of inflation, which was 2.54 percent in 2016 and 2 percent for the first half of 2017. Workers' salaries also aren't rising as quickly as health care costs. The most recent data from the Federal Reserve shows that wages are growing by 3.2 percent annually. The National Business Group of Health's annual study surveyed 148 companies, 79 percent of which have 10,000 or more employees. It shows that employers rank the cost of ""specialty pharmaceuticals"" as the top driver of cost increases, which is unchanged from last year's survey results. Basically, new treatments for specific conditions ranging from diabetes and asthma to hemophilia and immune disorders can come with hefty price tags. ""There's a rich pipeline of specialty medicines,"" Marcotte said. ""They can be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per treatment."" Marcotte said that the cost can vary depending on where the treatment is administered (i.e., a hospital or doctor's office or even in the home). The survey shows that 44 percent of companies plan to combat pharma costs in part by better managing where patients receive those high-price medicines. Employers also increasingly have been offer high-deductible plans as a way to control costs. The study shows that by next year, 90 percent of large companies will offer this option. Under these plans — sometimes called consumer-driven health plans in industry lingo — employees can put away tax-deductible savings in a health savings account, or HSA. For 2017, contribution limits are $3,400 for individual coverage and $6,750 for family plans. An extra $1,000 is allowed for people age 55 or older. HSA balances can carry over from year to year, and withdrawals are tax-free as long as they go toward qualified medical expenses. The survey also says that without such various cost-cutting measures being implemented by employers, overall costs would increase by 6.6 percent next year instead of the anticipated 5 percent.

481, ,8102017,CNBC,8032017,"Discount supermarket chain Aldi is withdrawing all eggs from sale at its more than 4,000 stores in Germany as a precaution, it said on Friday, as a scare over the possible contamination of eggs with insecticide spreads. Traces of insecticide fipronil were found in eggs in Belgium and the Netherlands last month, which has led to the temporary shut-down of some poultry farms and to supermarkets halting the sale of eggs from the Netherlands. Fipronil is considered by the World Health Organization to be moderately toxic, with high doses leading to feelings of nausea and dizziness. Very large quantities can cause damage to the kidneys, liver and lymph glands. Investigators suspect the chemical may have gotten into eggs through a contaminated detergent against mites called Dega 16 that is used to clean barns, and criminal investigations have been launched in both Belgium and the Netherlands. The Netherlands is the world's second-largest agricultural exporter after the United States and sells around 5 billion eggs a year to Germany. The detergent was also supplied to farms in the northern German state of Lower Saxony, from where eggs were distributed across the country, Lower Saxony's agriculture ministry said. Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said this week only a limited type of egg, recognizable by specific serial numbers, posed a risk. Nonetheless, around 180 poultry companies in the Netherlands have been temporarily closed, and some firms have culled their flock. A number of supermarket chains including Germany's REWE and Penny have taken Dutch eggs off their shelves. Aldi is the first major retailer to stop the sale of eggs altogether, regardless of origin. ""This is merely a precaution, there is no reason to assume there are any health risks,"" Aldi North and Aldi South, the two operators of Aldi stores, said in a joint statement on Friday. Aldi South's 190 stores in Switzerland have stopped the sale of imported eggs, Aldi Suisse said in a separate statement. The Dutch organisation of food retailers CBL said on Friday all possibly contaminated eggs would be removed from the shelves of supermarkets in the Netherlands. Albert Heijn, the country's largest supermarket chain, said it had removed two thirds of the 38 different kind of eggs it normally sells. The company, part of Ahold Delhaize <AD.AS>, said it could not yet estimate the cost of the move. Public prosecutors in Belgium and the Netherlands are investigating poultry service providers that are suspected of having added Dega 16 to their products, the European Commission said, without providing further details.

Shares of defense companies like Lockheed Martin, L3 Communications and Raytheon have surged to record highs in the wake of remarks President Donald Trump made Tuesday about meeting North Korea with ""fire and fury"" if the nation were to threaten the United States. Investors likely flocked to buy up shares of the defense names with the thought that should the U.S. actually engage militarily with North Korea, defense contractors would benefit. Baird on Thursday raised its price target for Raytheon by 25 percent, implying about 18 percent upside from current levels. ""We are raising the price target of Raytheon … reflecting the significant programs wins both domestically and internationally for missile defense and missile systems that puts Raytheon in position for favorable organic growth in 2018 and beyond,"" analyst Peter Arment wrote in a note to clients.

484,Dan Mangan,8102017,CNBC,8032017,"A federal jury Friday found notorious ""Pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli guilty of three counts of securities fraud — but acquitted him of five other criminal counts related to hedge funds investors and a drug company he founded. The split verdict in Shkreli's trial came at about 2:37 p.m. on the fifth day of jury deliberations, after a more-than-month-long trial in Brooklyn, New York, federal court. At that trial, prosecutors claimed Shkreli had defrauded multiple investors in his two hedge funds out of millions of dollars, only to repay them with stock and cash that he looted from a the biotech company he created, Retrophin. While the seven-woman, five-man jury clearly accepted some of the prosecution's evidence, it rejected other parts of their argument. The mixed decision perplexed many in the courtroom, including the 34-year-old Shkreli, who first drew widespread public scorn in 2015 for raising the price of a lifesaving drug by more than 5,000 percent. He looked over quizzically at one of this lawyers, Marc Agnifilo, each of the three times that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto interrupted a set of ""not guilty"" announcements she was reading off of the jury's verdict sheet with a ""guilty"" one. A juror who was quoted anonymously by the New York Times, said  ""In some of the counts at least we couldn't find that he intentionally stole from them and the reasoning was to hurt them."" Matsumoto did not set a sentencing date. That will happen after prosecutors and defense lawyers argue how much, if any, money Shkreli should be ordered to forfeit, and after defense lawyers ask her to overturn the guilty verdicts. Shkreli, who remains free on $5 million bail, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But he is sure to receive a far-less-severe punishment than that, given his lack of a criminal record, and other factors. ""I think we are delighted in many ways,"" said Shkreli said outside of the courthouse. ""This was a witch hunt of epic proportions and maybe they found one or two broomsticks but at the end of the day we've been acquitted of the most important charges in this case."" He almost immediately afterward used his new Twitter account, @samthemanTP, to comment on the outcome of the case, and also started a livestream on YouTube from his apartment. Tweet Shkreli's lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told a group of journalists, ""I hope tomorrow's reports inform the public that Martin Shkreli went to trial and despite being Martin Shkreli he won more than he lost."" But acting United States Attorney Bridget Rohde, whose office prosecuted Shkreli, said, ""We're gratified as we stand here today at the jury's verdict."" ""Justice has been served,"" said Rohde, whose prosecution team next plans to try Shkreli's co-defendant and former business lawyer Evan Greebel this fall. Brafman said the amount of money Shkreli could be made to surrender would have been much higher if he had been found guilty of ripping off Retrophin, to repay swindled hedge-fund investors. But Shkreli was acquitted of that charge, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which Brafman referred to as ""the money count."" Brafman said that because the jury found that any loss suffered by Retrophin was either low, or non-existent, as the defense claims, the sentence recommended for Shkreli will be light. ""I think we would love to have a complete sweep but five out of eight counts, not guilty, is in our view a very good verdict especially since count seven, the main count that impacts on the loss in this case, that was the most important count in the case from our perspective,"" Brafman said. ""And for Martin to be found not guilty of that count is a very, very good result as far as we are concerned,"" Brafman said. He noted that Matsumoto will have ""enormous discretion"" in sentencing Shkreli, who has no criminal history. Brafman also said, ""I think this verdict is a reasonably good verdict under the circumstances ... we are 90 percent pleased."" The charges against Shkreli were unrelated to his decision, while CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, to raise the price of the drug Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill in 2015. The price increase came as he was being investigated for the case that led to his trial. Prosecutors said a mountain of testimony and evidence at that trial showed that Shkreli duped multiple investors into putting millions of dollars into two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by falsely claiming to have an excellent record of running such funds, and by falsely stating his investment strategy had a low level of risk. After getting their money, prosecutor said, Shkreli quickly lost much of it, and also used some of it to capitalize his infant company Retrophin even as he continued sending out financial statements to investors claiming positive returns. And when investors asked for their money to be redeemed to them in cash, Shkreli brushed them off for months or more, inventing excuses and suggesting alternative ways to pay them back, according to the prosecution's case. Two of the securities fraud counts for which Shkreli was convicted related to those hedge funds. Prosecutors said that he then improperly used Retrophin stock and cash from the young firm to pay off the the funds' investors. While Shkreli was acquitted of on Retrophin-related count, he was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with Retrophin.

On average, emergency-room bills for out-of-network care is 4.4 times higher than what Medicare allows for the same services, costing consumers more than $3 billion a year, according to a nationwide study by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. Put another way, emergency medicine physician charges came to about $4 billion versus $898 million in Medicare allowable amounts. Overall, the study found that emergency departments are charging anywhere from 1.0–12.6 times ($100–$12,600) more than what Medicare pays for services. The greatest disparities were for those who lack insurance or have to go to a facility that's not in their health plan's network.  The biggest overcharges were made to poor and minority patients, and the biggest gaps between charges for Medicare and uninsured patients were at for-profit hospitals, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest, the study said. The service with the highest median markup ratio? Wound closures, at 7.0, while interpreting head CT scans had the greatest within-hospital pricing variation, with markup ratios ranging between 1.6 and 27. General internal medicine physicians had a markup rate, compared to Medicare pricing, less than half what is billed by ER physicians. For a physician review of an electrocardiogram, the median Medicare allowable rate is $16, but emergency departments charged anywhere from $18 to $317, with a median charge of $95 (or a markup ratio of 6.0), the Johns Hopkins study found. General internal medicine doctors in hospitals charged an average of $62 for the same service. For the study, researchers analyzed the Medicare billing records for 12,337 emergency medicine physicians practicing in almost 300 hospitals in all 50 states in 2013 to determine how much emergency departments billed for services compared to the Medicare allowable amount (the sum of what Medicare pays, the deductible and coinsurance that patients pay, and the amount any third party such as the patient pays). More from Modern Medicine:The data that's fueling Joe Biden's cancer moonshot Google's role in an emerging war against killer mosquitoes Crisis in America: The organ transplant shortage ER care may be the one place in the health system where consumers ask the fewest questions and get exploited on price the most, says Martin Makary, a Hopkins surgeon and professor of public health policy who was the lead investigator for the study. ""This is consistent with outlier stories we've always heard about seeking care out of network,'' Makary said. ""Generally, these patients feeling like they're being treated as if they did something wrong. We can't expect people to live within a local network bubble and never leave."" The Johns Hopkins' data tracks a troubling pattern when it comes to ER billing. Health policy journal Health Affairs found in a 2016 study that 1 in 5 inpatient emergency-room cases result in surprise bills. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last year found that among insured, non-elderly adults struggling to pay medical bills, charges from out-of-network providers were a contributing factor one-third of the time. And 7 in 10 individuals with unaffordable out-of-network medical bills did found that the provider wasn't in their plan's network when they received care. The surprise bills are not going away. One reason: An investigation last month by the New York Times, including work done by Yale University researchers, found that some hospitals are outsourcing emergency-room services to out-of-network doctors groups and for-profit companies that aggressively hike prices. ""This is a huge problem,"" said Jenifer Bosco, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. ""Consumers are being overcharged, sometimes exorbitantly."" The real questions for consumers are: What can they do to prevent overcharges? How can they fight back? What rights do they have that they may not know about? The advice is slightly different for insured and uninsured patients, Bosco said. Families with incomes low enough to qualify for the Medicaid expansion or for Obamacare subsidies have rights that don't always apply to wealthier patients. Here are some key steps to protect yourself. 1. Get to a nonprofit hospital, if at all possible. Depending on the emergency, this may not be practical, experts concede. But a provision of the Affordable Care Act, which wasn't yet in force in 2013, requires nonprofit hospitals to have written financial assistance policies and to limit charges for those who qualify for financial assistance to no more than the rates generally paid by other insurers, usually the Medicare rate, said Marie Watteau, a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association. ""Hospital payments will vary because they reflect each individual hospital and the unique care needs of the patient population it serves,"" Watteau said in a statement. ""One community may have sicker patients with more chronic illness, while another may care for more uninsured patients. Drawing information that is meaningful from a uniform set of charges is challenging because hospital care is individually tailored to each patient's needs."" For single Americans making $48,284 or less, or families with incomes below $92,000, this provision can limit the amount emergency rooms can charge, making a painful accident or illness hurt your wallet less. But for-profit hospitals aren't covered by the provision, Bosco said. 2. Ask for financial counseling at the ER. Hospitals routinely have this service available, and it can be the key to learning your rights. On top of the Obamacare provision covering nonprofit hospitals, Medicaid-eligible patients are able to apply for coverage up to 10 days retroactively, Bosco said. That can cover nearly all of the unexpected bills for patients who make less than Medicaid cutoffs, about $33,900 for a family of four. (The cap varies by state.) In addition, a counselor can explain that the ACA requires that Obamacare plans cover out-of-network ER care without co-pays over and above what in-network ERs charge — it's one of the essential health benefits the law requires subsidy-eligible plans to have. Most employer-provided plans have a similar provision. 3. After you get the bill, go back to the hospital or doctor and negotiate. It's well known that providers give insurers, both private and public, big breaks on quoted rates. Uninsured or out-of-network patients initially get billed at so-called chargemaster rates. But Makary and Bosco agree that hospitals will rarely dig in to get the full price when challenged. If they do, they risk getting nothing for their services, so they are likely to cut the price and negotiate a payment plan. In addition, hospitals are getting better about prominently posting their financial-assistance policies in ERs, Bosco said. ""It's not a great solution,"" Bosco said. ""But patients with a low income can ask for the Medicare or Medicaid rate.''

486,Meg Tirrell,8102017,CNBC,8032017,"It's been less than a year since Jonathan Silverstein, a venture capitalist at health-care fund OrbiMed, received the diagnosis that changed everything. Parkinson's disease at age 49. A potentially more aggressive, inherited form, driven by a mutation in a gene called GBA. It affects up to 10 percent of Americans with Parkinson's, and — as for other forms of the neurodegenerative disease — there is no cure, or even treatments that slow its course. In recent months, Silverstein and his wife, Natalie, set up the Silverstein Foundation, raised $6 million from donors and gave $10 million of their own money to fund half a dozen promising projects and start a new company. ""I'm a venture capitalist, and what a venture capitalist is, is a problem-solver,"" Silverstein said from OrbiMed's New York offices. ""This was a problem that was not just impacting me, but another 100,000 people around the globe."" His nonprofit foundation has three main goals: first, find a way to halt progression of Parkinson's with GBA. Next, identify a regenerative approach to repair the damage it wreaks. And finally, find a way to prevent it altogether. Accomplishing even just the first would be to do something that's never been done. Despite years of effort and capital — from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research to funding from Google founder Sergey Brin — treatments for Parkinson's disease have remained as elusive as those for other devastating neurodegenerative conditions, like Alzheimer's. ""It has been extremely challenging, and many clinical trials have failed,"" said Dr. Dimitri Krainc, chairman of the department of neurology and director of the Center for Rare Neurological Diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""However, we have learned important lessons from these failures."" The disease was first described two centuries ago, in 1817, by British surgeon James Parkinson. In a document he called ""An Essay on the Shaking Palsy,"" Parkinson described a condition characterized by ""involuntary tremulous motion, with lessened muscular power."" We know now that Parkinson's results from loss of brain cells, including those that produce the chemical messenger dopamine, important for coordinating movement. Treatments have been developed to provide symptomatic relief, such as levodopa, which helps replenish the brain's supply of dopamine, but those have a set of problems of their own. Over time, people gradually need to increase the dose, and the medicines can lead to involuntary movement called dyskinesia. The bigger problem, though, is that levodopa and other approved agents aren't neuroprotective, said Krainc, ""meaning that they do not prevent neurons from degenerating."" Recent advancements in genetics provide some hope for better drug targets — including, according to Krainc, for the kind of Parkinson's that Silverstein has, driven by a mutation in GBA. The GBA gene is responsible for creating a protein known as GCase, or glucocerebrosidase, important for helping clear junk out of cells. And work is underway already: A clinical trial from Sanofi's Genzyme unit is ongoing, and, in January, drugmaker Allergan bought an exclusive option to acquire a company called Lysosomal Therapeutics, whose lead program also focuses on GBA-associated Parkinson's. Krainc is a co-founder of Lysosomal Therapeutics and chairs its scientific advisory board. ""There is a real need for disease-modifying treatment,"" Allergan CEO Brent Saunders told CNBC. Silverstein said he hopes the most advanced drugs will be able to help him, but he doesn't plan on depending on them. After his diagnosis, he sent out a massive call for any work in Parkinson's with GBA. ""We were just floored with the response,"" he said. Hundreds of ideas flowed in — ""some of them a little bit crazier than others"" — but about 80 he deemed worth looking at more closely. Since then, the Silverstein Foundation has made six funding grants to academic labs and private biotech companies, and received a $5 million donation from drugmaker Celgene. Being a patient as well as a venture capitalist has changed Silverstein's approach. ""As a venture capitalist, your first boss is your investors, so returns are the first thing that you have to be focused on,"" he said. That can lead to less risk-taking than might lead to bigger advances. ""But when you're a patient, you come at it from a completely different viewpoint,"" Silverstein said. ""You're not interested in incremental change. You're interested in cures."" Wednesday, along with OrbiMed and gene therapy biotech RegenXBio, the foundation announced the launch of a new company called Prevail Therapeutics. The founders of rare-disease drug giant Alexion, Leonard Bell and Stephen Squinto, are joining the board. Silverstein knows firsthand the odds, and the timelines of traditional drug development are stacked against him. It's estimated only 1 in 10 experimental compounds that enter human trials make it to market, and it takes years to get through the FDA approval process. But a piece of advice, he said, has remained with him: ""Be hopeful."" He's also determined. Julian Adams, a drug developer who met Silverstein two decades ago, recalled learning of his diagnosis and offering sympathies. ""I got this very rapid turnaround,"" Adams said of Silverstein's response: ""'I don't need your sympathies; I need your brains and I need a cure.'"" Adams joined the Silverstein Foundation's scientific advisory board, he said, ""10 seconds later."" ""He's so deeply respected in his field,"" Natalie Silverstein, Jonathan's wife of 17 years, said from their home in Manhattan. ""The rallying around him has been incredible."" One of his biggest successes, Silverstein recently recounted, is a drug called Strensiq, sold by Alexion for a rare, genetic bone disease called hypophosphatasia. He described seeing a baby, whose mother had been told she wouldn't live past a few more months, receive a dose of the medicine when she was just a few weeks old. She's now 9, said Silverstein, who's friends with her mom on Facebook. She's ""riding bikes and climbing trees and all those sorts of things."" ""I've seen miracles happen,"" Silverstein said. ""And … now I've got to create another miracle.""

487,"Constance Gustke, special to CNBC.com",8102017,CNBC,8032017,"After working with people with dementia for many years as a licensed nursing home administrator, Scott Tarde was fed up with the lack of affordable care options. So as the CEO of George G. Glenner Alzheimer's Family Centers, he decided to reimagine a new kind of day care: a faux mini-town with a 1950s and 1960s look designed for people with dementia. His concept is based on reminiscence therapy. His creation is Glenner Town Square, set to open in San Diego next spring. Reminiscence therapy, developed by psychologist Ellen Langer in 1979, involves the use of past activities, events and experiences with other people, usually with the aid of music and tangible, visual prompts from earlier years, such as photographs and familiar household items. Glenner Town Square bathes the senses in sights and smells to reflect a person's younger days. Its 9,000 square feet of space, designed by renowned architect Douglas Pancake, sits in an industrial building and will include a pet store with shelter puppies, department store with clothes and a movie theater with real popcorn. Everyplace is staffed with trained caregivers. Besides being fun, the retro town, outfitted with gas-lit streetlamps, also has real uses, like triggering positive past memories, say experts, and can help people with dementia feel calmer and need fewer drugs. The goal is to offer a safe location where residents have a structured day, as well as autonomy and independence — giving them a higher quality of life. ""We're taking people back to their strongest memories,"" says Tarde, noting it is a form of time-travel therapy. ""Long-term memories are more preserved than short-term ones."" Tarde, who has 20 years of experience working in the long-term care industry, has targeted a growing demographic in America. An estimated 5.4 million people in the United States suffer from Alzheimer's disease, a number that is expected to grow as baby boomers age. Even more suffer from a form of dementia. He got the idea for the village after visiting a junior-achievement mini-city in San Diego, where young people discover how the ""real world"" works by learning how to generate wealth and effectively manage it. More from Modern Medicine:A major step forward in fighting Alzheimer'sNew technology that can help with hearing loss Tarde has ambitious national plans, too. He wants to build 100 of these day care centers throughout the United States within 20 years. ""Families need reliable options and meaningful experiences,"" he says. As the projected number of dementia patients grows, he adds, society will need new, viable solutions. Glenner Town Square fits into a new type of community called dementia villages. They're attempting to bring fresh models of care, rather than just relying on drugs to take the sharp edges off the disease. The villages also provide safety and connection, which can increase well-being. Tarde's creation may be the United States' first dementia village, though. In 2009 the first kind of residential dementia village appeared in Hogewey, Holland, outside Amsterdam. Inhabitants walk freely among the walled town's parklike grounds and live in housing units arranged by theme. There are also grocery stores, hair salons and pubs, where the staff works and keeps an eye on the 152 residents The village is about the size of 10 football fields. Bringing more residential dementia villages to the United States may be a challenge. Hogewey is mainly funded by the Dutch government. Glenner Town Square, conversely, is privately funded by real estate developers Village Holdings, who have anted up $1 million in capital so far. The cost for day visitors, though, is affordable at $95 per day, says Tarde. Still, Tarde is optimistic about the power of day programs like Glenner Town Square to transform lives. He believes that medicine alone can't effectively treat people with Alzheimer's. ""Many people can also stay home if they have the right support,"" he says. There's such a tsunami of dementia care needed, agrees Donna Surges Tatum, board of directors of the National Certification Board for Alzheimer and Aging Care. In the United States an estimated 4 million to 5 million Americans currently have dementia. It remains the most expensive disease in America — a study funded by the National Institute on Aging  estimated that in 2010 it cost up to $215 billion a year to care for dementia patients, surpassing heart disease ($102 billion) and cancer ($77 billion). In addition, 5.5 million people are currently living with Alzheimer's. By 2050 that number is projected to reach 13.8 million, according to the Alzheimer's Association. ""It's expensive to create a whole village,"" she says. ""And we have such trouble getting care to anyone needs who it these days."" Reminiscence therapy, which taps into positive back memories, works well, though, she adds. These villages also emphasize personalized care and more engagement, too. ""People are currently sometimes drugged more than necessary,"" she adds. Jason Karlawish, a co-director at Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees. He advocates for spaces that tap into well-learned memories and comfort. ""They should be safe, social and engaged,"" he says. Social isolation can even lead to dementia, according to studies, he says. ""People with dementia need to feel like they're part of the human race,"" he adds. ""And so we need new approaches that aren't just biomedical."" For people used to growing up on farms, Prairie Elder Care in Kansas has a different solution. It's developing a dementia-care residence farm in Overland Park, Kansas, set to open next year. Called Prairie Farmstead, it has chicken coops and gardens. About 16 residents will always be supervised. But they can also plant tomatoes or roam in a sensory garden with butterflies. The cost is about $7,400 per month. ""Men with dementia can be difficult to engage,"" says Mandy Shoemaker, co-owner of Prairie Elder Care. ""They end up being on lots of medications for aggressive behaviors."" The goal, she says, is giving them back control over their lives. ""Control is slowly lost over the most basic decisions,"" she adds, explaining that with more engagement, they can be more calm and connected. There are no one-size-fits-all dementia villages, though, says Mario Garrett, professor of gerontology at San Diego State University. ""Your 1950s is completely different then my 1950s,"" he says. Yet every attempt is a good one, he adds, since people with dementia tend to be ignored. Even dementia village models will evolve into something better, he says. ""People need emotional support.""

If you've picked up a prescription from your local pharmacy recently, you probably don't need me to tell you that prescription drug prices have handily outpaced wage growth and the rate of inflation in the U.S. for some time now. According to Segal Consulting, prescription drugs are estimated to rise by 11.6% in 2017 for those under the age of 65, which follows an average price increase of 11.3% in 2016 for this same age group. Seniors don't have it much better, with projected increases in drug prices this year of 9.9%, following the 10.9% they rose in 2016. Image source: Getty Images. A separate report from AARP confirmed the pain seniors are dealing with when it comes to drug costs. Between the end of 2005 and the end of 2015, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Workers rose by an aggregate of 21.6%. This measurement suggests that a diverse basket of goods and services would be 21.6% more expensive after 10 years. However, prescription drug prices rose by 172.1% over the same period. The magnitude of prescription drug hikes is what's really eroded the purchasing power of Social Security benefits over the last decade. But when we're talking about drug inflation, nothing stands out more than cancer drugs, which often have six-digit annual costs. Last year, when I examined the approximate annual cost of 20 recently approved cancer drugs, 17 had annual costs in excess of $104,000. It's possible two of the remaining three did as well, but insufficient cost data existed at the time, because drugmakers, pharmacy-benefit management companies, and insurers, tend to be pretty secretive when it comes to wholesale list prices for prescription drugs. How on Earth can a $100,000-plus price tag be justified? Here are 10 reasons that describe why cancer drugs cost as much as they do. Image source: Getty Images. To begin with, cancer drugs are often specialized therapies. More and more these are drugs that aren't being administered as global chemotherapies designed to wipe out both cancerous and healthy cells. Instead, cancer drugs are being developed that target a specific mutation or biomarker within the body. Yes, this means certain cancer drugs are exclusionary and will only work for select patients of a particular cancer type. However, it often means a higher response rate, which can, in turn, lead to a partial or complete response and an improvement in the quality of life (and perhaps life expectancy). What patients are paying for is often this specialization and the fact that because it's targeted at a specific biomarker, a cancer drug's patient pool is narrower that previous-generation cancer drugs. Add to the previous point that cancer drugs, along with practically any drug that works its way through the drug development process in the U.S., has a lengthy patent protection period. From the time a biotech or pharmaceutical gets the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials, a 20-year clock begins to tick. This clock generally prevents generic drugs from entering the marketplace at substantial discounts in price to branded therapies. This usually leaves drugmakers with a decade or longer to market their pricey medicines without the fear of cheaper generic competition. Also, added protections are given to drugs that treat orphan diseases, which are defined as affecting 200,000 or fewer patients in the United States. If a cancer-drug maker focuses on an orphan type of cancer, then it would receive these extra protections from competition. Image source: Getty Images. The cost to develop a new drug is exceptionally expensive, with an analysis by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development pegging the total direct and indirect costs (i.e., time costs) combined as $2.56 billion.  Drug companies are looking to recoup these costs when they price their cancer drugs. Among the more than 30 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), just two don't have a universal health plan in place: the U.S. and Mexico. Because the U.S. lacks a universal health plan -- and make no mistake, the Affordable Care Act is not a universal health plan -- its lawmakers are unable to cap drug pricing. This isn't to say the government couldn't attempt to reform drug-pricing practices in the U.S., but it would be highly unlikely with Republican lawmakers generally favoring free-market economics, and therefore the ability of drugmakers to price their own products as they see fit. Image source: Getty Images. On top of not having a universal health plan, the U.S. is also filled with insurance companies that essentially have no backbone. There are thousands of approved medicines, but insurers often exclude just a few dozen from their approved formularies because of price. The reason? Insurers don't want to face the wrath of their members for excluding a popular or effective drug, which could lead to a drop in membership. Even though it's not a cancer product, Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni, which are both used to treat hepatitis C, are great examples. These drugs revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C by providing an effective cure, but their wholesale cost for a standard 12-week treatment are $84,000 and $94,500, respectively. Despite protests from the public and grumbling from Congress over these high costs, insurers were far too worried about excluding these drugs from their formularies and risking the loss of a lot of patients, so they kept them both on their approved-drug lists. A somewhat behind-the-scenes reason cancer drug prices are soaring is that the foundation of how certain late-stage cancer types are treated has changed. Cancer immunotherapies, which are drugs designed to stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, are becoming a mainstay in some advanced cancers. More specifically, cancer immunotherapies have been shown in some instances to work better with existing cancer drugs as a combination therapy, as opposed to a monotherapy. While this can increase the objective response rate and improve quality of life for patients whose tumors have specific biomarkers, it also means having to pay for two cancer drugs instead of one. That's an easy way to double your cancer drug costs overnight. Image source: Getty Images. Now for the obvious: Supply and demand always matter. When it comes to demand, no country has more of an appetite for pharmaceutical products than the U.S. -- and that includes all pharmaceuticals, not just cancer drugs. A 2014 analysis from PBS found that the U.S. spends more per capita on drugs than any other OECD country by a mile, and that it ranked first in the use of a number of medicine types.  For example, American demand is tops on the list for antipsychotics, drugs for dementia, respiratory problems, and rheumatoid arthritis. If demand for prescription medicines is high, including cancer drugs, list prices will follow that demand higher. Let's also not forget that drugmakers often have to spend quite a bit on legal matters. This can include lawsuits against the company from patients, as well as the protection of their intellectual property from competitors. Corporate legal proceedings can sometimes takes years to hash out, which can mean millions or billions in annual legal costs, depending on the size of the company, or the legal problem in question. For instance, a little more than a week ago, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), which has one of the leading cancer immunotherapies on the market with Opdivo, filed a lawsuit against Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) subsidiary Genentech that suggests its more recently approved cancer immunotherapy, Tecentriq, exploits treatment patterns used by Opdivo. Bristol-Myers is seeking as of now unspecified damages, but since Tecentriq is expected to be a blockbuster drug, we could be talking about billions in annual revenue. High cancer-drug prices fuel this IP defense. Image source: Getty Images. Compared with other countries, Americans are also paying a high price for substantially quicker access to new medicines. Once the FDA approves a new drug, be it a cancer drug or one to treat diabetes, it becomes immediately available for sale. The one exception would be drugs considered addictive or with the potential for abuse, which may have to wait for scheduling from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. On the other hand, countries with universal health plans don't work this way. In Europe, once the European Medicines Agency has given the thumbs-up to a cancer drug, the drugmaker must then negotiate on pricing and rebates with each and every EU country. It's a tedious process that can delay the launch of a drug by months, or years, relative to the United States. Finally, drugmakers believe they can get away with slapping six-digit price tags on cancer drugs in the U.S. because the standard of living is relatively high, especially when it comes to income. In 2011, the Pew Research Center took a look at how Americans stacked up next to the rest of the world on the basis of income. Whereas 15% of the global population was considered poor (living on $2 a day, or less), and 56% was low income (living on $2-$10 a day), just a combined 5% of the U.S. population fit this mold. Comparatively, a ""high-income individual"" is described as one living on $50 or more a day. Just 7% of the global population met this definition compared to 56% of Americans in 2011. Drugmakers view this wealth as all the reason they need to pass along high cancer drug prices. Cancer drug inflation shows little signs of slowing, which means you should be prepared for these costs by saving more, getting insured, and investing for your future. ","

After a complaint was filed in federal court alleging that Dunkin' Brands' (NASDAQ:DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts' steak sandwiches do not actually contain ""steak,"" a new suit makes similar charges about its blueberry bakery items. The lawsuit, which was filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, was filed by attorneys for Bartosz Grabowski ""and on behalf of all others similarly situated."" It seeks class action status. The plaintiff claims that the coffee chain's various blueberry-named bakery products, including Glazed Blueberry doughnuts, Blueberry Butternut doughnuts, and Blueberry Crumb Cake doughnuts, contain imitation blueberries ""that highly resemble actual blueberries due to their round shape and blue color."" Lawyers claim that if their client had known the products did not contain blueberries, he either would not have purchased them or would have paid significantly less for the products. They seek in excess of $5 million to remedy the situation. Dunkin' Donuts does not list blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry doughnuts. Image source: Getty Images. While Dunkin' Donuts lists blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry muffins, none of its blueberry doughnuts list the fruit as an ingredient. The company's various ""blueberry"" doughnut flavors appear to use a mix of non-fruit ingredients to simulate blueberries in the baked treats. The lawsuit charges that this is an attempt to deceive consumers. Through its manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the Blueberry Products, Defendant has represented that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. Defendant has named the Blueberry Products as ""Blueberry Butternut"", ""Blueberry Crumb Cake"", and ""Glazed Blueberry"", indicating that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. The lawsuit contends that blueberries have health benefits that consumers would be willing to pay more for. It also notes that when buying a doughnut in-store, consumers see the blueberry doughnuts displayed alongside other products, including various doughnuts and muffins, that contain the fruit they are named for. Food lawsuits have become common in recent years with Subway being sued over its sandwiches not being the size advertised while Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has been sued multiple times over whether it fills its drinks properly. While Starbucks has either won its cases or seen them dismissed, Subway did have to pay up to $525,000 in attorneys fees, and take steps to ensure its 12-inch sandwiches actually measure 12 inches. In the case of the Dunkin' suit, the case is a little different because it involves whether it's OK to call a product ""blueberry"" when it contains no blueberries. There is some precedent for this as certain beverage products marketed using fruit names do list how much (or how little) actual juice they contain. If this case proceeds, it's possible that Dunkin' may have to change its marketing for these products. Given the past history of lawsuits like this, it's somewhat unlikely the plaintiffs will receive a large cash payout. That's because while the lawsuit makes a case for the benefits of the fruit, noting that ""blueberries have the potential to limit the development and severity of certain cancers and vascular diseases,"" it's highly unlikely anyone specifically seeking those health benefits does so through doughnuts.

490,Sean Williams,8102017,Fool,8032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The more than 50-year war that's been waged by the U.S. against tobacco companies has been working. According to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 15.1% of U.S. adults (36.5 million) aged 18 and older were smoking cigarettes as of 2015. That's down from 20.9% of all U.S. adults back in 2005, and more than 40% of all adults back in the mid-1960s. Since smoking tobacco has unquestionably been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and cancer, this sizable decrease in adult smokers has undoubtedly saved lives and helped increase average life expectancies. Image source: Getty Images. However, there's a long way to go. Cigarette smoking still accounts for more than 480,000 deaths per year, or roughly 1 in every 5 annual deaths. Despite its ongoing educational campaign to curb smoking, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) want to do more to get smokers to put down their cigarettes for good. Late last week, the FDA unveiled its latest proposal, which could represent the first true nail in the coffin for the traditional tobacco industry. The FDA proposes cutting nicotine levels in cigarettes to levels it would deem as minimally addictive, or possibly even non-addictive. The FDA can't outright ban tobacco, but its regulatory proposals could certainly push down acceptable nicotine levels in cigarettes. Nicotine itself isn't a cancer-causing agent, but it's what's responsible for creating the addiction that keeps consumers coming back for more, and thereby smoking cigarettes that do have cancer- and disease-causing chemicals. By lowering nicotine content in cigarettes, the FDA presumes that it'll reduce the addictive quality of tobacco -- meaning consumers will smoke less, quit altogether, or move their habit to an alternative source, such as electronic cigarettes or a nicotine patch. All of these scenarios are potentially bad news for Big Tobacco. Image source: Getty Images. It should be noted that the FDA's proposal won't simply become a new regulation. Proposals of this sort allow for public commentary and input from multiple stakeholders before any measures are officially taken. In other words, it could be months, or longer, before we have a firm idea on what could happen with nicotine regulation. In recent years, Big Tobacco has been utilizing its exceptional pricing power to counteract a fairly steady drop in cigarette volume. Altria (NYSE:MO), which operates solely in the U.S., has been almost entirely reliant on higher cigarette prices and its share-buyback program -- which has reduced its share count by approximately 175 million shares over the past decade -- to push its earnings per share (EPS) higher. Overseas manufacturers, such as Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), have been a little luckier in that they have a broader geographic audience with, in some countries, far less regulatory oversight. Thus, countries like India and China continue to offer plenty of growth opportunity in the wake of the U.S.'s crackdown on Big Tobacco. Philip Morris doesn't operate in the United States, but has, instead, benefited from its global diversification. U.S. manufacturers like Altria and Reynolds American, which is now owned by British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), have seen the writing on the wall for years that tougher regulations could be headed their way. As such, they've been focused on alternative-delivery platforms. Unfortunately, these alternative platforms, like electronic cigarettes, represent a nascent operating segment that is growing fast, but is still a low-to-mid single-digit contributor. British American Tobacco is the largest vape company in the world, so among all its peers, it should be best fit to test the idea that alternative-product platforms can stem weakness in combustible products. Then again, it could be quite some time before Big Tobacco sees any sort of genuine offset from the growth in smokeless products compared to the loss in volume from combustible tobacco products. Image source: Getty Images. Though the transition toward smokeless products and alternative-delivery platforms is ongoing, perhaps the biggest surprise of the FDA's proposal was commentary from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb that electronic cigarettes may offer a solution to curb tobacco use. Said Gottlieb, ""While there's still much research to be done on these products and the risks that they may pose, they may also present benefits that we must consider."" As Reuters points out, this commentary is consist with his position this past April that electronic cigarettes may be useful in helping to wean smokers off combustible cigarettes. But what's truly notable here is that Gottlieb's statement goes against published studies that have shown e-cigs, as they're also known, can be quite harmful. A study by National Jewish Health in 2014 found that liquid vapor from electronic cigarettes damaged epithelial cells in users' airways within minutes, leaving them more susceptible to viral infections. The effect lasted for up to 48 hours after use. Another study from researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 2015 wound up analyzing 51 flavored liquids for the presence of three chemicals known to have an adverse impact on a person's lungs. The findings showed that 92% of the liquids contained at least one of these three chemicals. Image source: Getty Images. There have also been concerns that liquid-vapor marketing has been targeted at children, given flavors like cotton candy and bubble gum. This was supposed to be taken care of this past August when new FDA regulations were to go into effect requiring the disclosure of ingredients being used in nicotine-containing vaping liquid and the placement of warning labels on packaging. Unfortunately, these regulations were pushed back, giving electronic cigarette and liquid-vaping producers additional years to comply, or fail to adhere to, the coming regulations. It certainly appears that we're coming to a crossroads for the tobacco industry. At some point, consumers simply won't be able to absorb any more substantial price hikes. Further, reassurances are needed from the FDA that electronic cigarettes are ""safe,"" in the relative sense of the word, before this Fool believes e-cigs have a shot to replace even 5%-10% of the lost revenue from combustible tobacco products. I'd suggest avoiding those delectable tobacco dividends and finding other high-yield companies to invest in until the FDA issues its final word on the matter. ","

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has notched a nominal record close (2,480.91), eclipsing the former record by three points. Still, the index remains range-bound, capped by its absolute all-time high (2,484.04). This area is under siege early Tuesday, and the session close will likely add color. More broadly, the S&P’s orderly three-week range at record territory is technically constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has taken flight, notching nine straight record closes. To reiterate, near-term support is poorly-defined, though the 22,040 and 21,930 areas mark potential floors. The Dow’s first notable support matches its breakout point, the July peak of 21,682. Conversely, the Nasdaq Composite continues to digest the late-July plunge amid jagged price action. Still, the index has maintained its first significant support —the 6,342-to-6,344 area — matching the breakout point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq’s bearish key reversal — the late-July downdraft — has been stemmed by support matching the 6,342 breakout point. (The closing low rests at 6,340.) The absence of downside follow-through, seven sessions after the initial plunge, is technically constructive. In a textbook world, the seven sessions or so following a major market move conventionally constitute the “caution-zone” period. Looking elsewhere, the Dow industrials’ six-month chart above includes the Bollinger bands, also known as volatility bands. Illustrated in red, the bands encompass two standard deviations of the Dow’s trailing 20-day volatility. Consider that consecutive closes higher signal a tension between two time horizons. For the near-term, the Dow is overbought, and due to consolidate. An eventual reversion to the mean — or at least a pullback to the range — would be expected. More broadly, the Dow’s bullish momentum registers as statistically extreme, and improves the chances of longer-term follow-through. See the February closes atop the bands, subsequent pullback, and unseasonal summer follow-through. (The Dow’s prevailing five-session string concluded on Aug. 3.) Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is not taking flight, though it is acting well technically. To reiterate, the S&P’s prevailing bull flag — the tight three-week range — is a continuation pattern, positioning the index to extend the uptrend. Consider that the 50-day moving average, currently 2,446, is rising toward the 2,453 breakout point. Broadly speaking, the big three U.S. benchmarks have asserted a slight technical divergence. Perhaps most obviously, the Dow Jones industrial Average has taken flight, and is refusing to pull in. The blue-chip benchmark is vying for its eleventh straight daily gain, and tenth straight record close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 remains range-bound — though a breakout attempt is underway — while the Nasdaq Composite digests its late-July plunge. Despite the slight cross currents, the bigger-picture backdrop remains constructive.

Amid the cross currents, the S&P 500 has notched a nominal record close — by a narrow three-point margin — and a grinding-higher breakout attempt remains underway. Tactically, the S&P’s range top (2,484) is under siege early Tuesday. A near-term target, detailed previously, projects to the 2,500 mark on a breakout. Beyond the immediate breakout attempt, the S&P 500’s range-bound posture atop major support (2,453) — the prevailing bull flag — continues to support a bullish intermediate-term bias.

493,Rachel Koning Beals,8102017,MarketWatch,8032017,"Published: Aug 5, 2017 6:19 p.m. ET A Reuters/Ipsos survey found evidence of distrust of big airlines By Some profit-hunting airlines have sought to lure travelers into business and first class with comfy lounges, fancy cocktails and high-speed internet connections. Most travelers could care less; they’re watching their own bottom line. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll out this week showed that 83% of Americans put ticket prices chief among their considerations when booking personal tickets, topping travel perks and even an airline’s reputation. Don’t miss: Court orders FAA to address ‘the case of the incredible shrinking airline seat’ — this is how much they’ve actually shrunk Some 60% of those polled said they would not pay extra to avoid being assigned a middle seat. About 52% said they would not pay more to fly on their preferred airline. While more perks have been introduced to differentiate higher-priced ticket options, the airlines are not ignoring the other end of the spectrum.

494,Victor Reklaitis,8102017,MarketWatch,8032017,"Published: Aug 9, 2017 1:04 p.m. ET After North Korea’s saber-rattling, Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo stresses ‘Guam is American soil’ By Guam Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo on Wednesday reassured the U.S. territory’s residents and pushed back after North Korea’s latest saber-rattling. North Korea threatened a missile strike on a U.S. military base on Guam, with the bellicose message coming early Wednesday from that isolated Asian nation after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would respond with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if North Korea doesn’t halt its threats. Trump’s comments came after a Washington Post report said North Korea has built a miniaturized nuclear warhead. Calvo aimed to soothe at the start of a video message. “I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island or the Marianas,” the governor said. “My Homeland Security adviser, who is in communications with Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, notes there is no change in the threat level resulting from North Korea events.” He then said he had spoken with White House officials, who promised to protect the largest of the Marianas Islands. Calvo also suggested reporters aren’t giving the full picture when it comes to the U.S. territory in the western Pacific Ocean. “I also want to remind the national media that Guam is American soil, and we have 200,000 Americans in Guam and the Marianas. We are not just a military installation,” he said. Here is his full video message: Want news about Asia delivered to your inbox? Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Asia Daily newsletter. Sign up here.

While equities have been in an essentially uninterrupted uptrend all year—the S&P has advanced nearly 11% so far in 2017—recent moves have been slight in both directions. The S&P hasn’t had a daily move of at least 0.5% in 13 sessions, an abnormally long time. That is a sign that while investors aren’t broadly seeing the kind of risk that could lead to a correction, they’re also finding few reasons to keep pushing shares meaningfully higher from current levels. “We have a low-inflation environment, low interest rates, and corporate earnings have come in incredibly well. Those can all hold the market at these levels, but at the same time, you don’t have all sectors firing at once, and the calls for a correction could become a self-fulfilling prophesy,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. “I’m cautious about what I’m doing. I don’t need to chase the market, and nothing is exciting me enough to rush out and spend the cash I have on hand,” he said. “Why pay full price for a suit if I strongly suspect that it will go on sale in the next month or two?” Check out: Beneath the glow of stock-market records, darkly bearish trends are lurking See:  The stock market’s historically worst 2 months are dead ahead.

The e-cigarette vendors are introducing a variety of flavors which differs from menthol to the fusion of fruits and flavoring substances. These flavors are becoming a differentiator for vendors. The market for e-cigarettes in North America and Europe is projected to grow on account of increase in disposable incomes and smokers' population in these regions.

498,,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"Wichmann, 54, was widely viewed inside and outside of the company as Hemsley’s likely successor, although the timing of the change was sooner than some had expected. UnitedHealth’s shares fell 0.7 percent to $193.79 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Under 65-year-old Hemsley, UnitedHealth became one of the biggest sellers of insurance plans on the exchanges created as part of former President Barack Obama’s national healthcare law. However, mounting losses from the program prompted the company to largely exit from Obamacare plans in 2017. Current Chairman Richard Burke will become UnitedHealth’s lead independent chairman, UnitedHealth said. The changes are all effective Sept. 1. Wichmann has spent nearly 20 years with the company and was previously its chief financial officer. He has long been in charge of the insurer’s mergers and acquisitions. “Management is the single most important factor in our view of UnitedHealth - and with Hemsley staying in a very important operating/strategic role, we are very comfortable with this change,” Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick wrote in a research note. As founder, Burke also remains on the board. “The guardians of the UNH galaxy are firmly in place,” Skolnick said. The insurer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit last month, helped by its decision to abandon the Obamacare individual insurance market, amid uncertainty over the fate of the law under President Donald Trump’s administration. Hemsley said in July he was optimistic about the business next year, but that national and state healthcare policies would be a possible drag on profit in 2018. Shares of the company have risen nearly four-fold since Hemsley took over the helm. ","

499,,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"The move comes nearly two weeks after President Donald Trump took aim at insurers by threatening to cut the healthcare subsidy payments that make Obamacare plans affordable, after repeatedly failing in his efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. Insurers are facing an upheaval in their health insurance businesses due to uncertainty over the healthcare legislation as Republican lawmakers seek to follow through on their promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The insurers have asked the government to commit to making the $8 billion in subsidy payments for 2018, saying they may raise rates or leave the individual insurance marketplace if there is too much uncertainty. On Monday, Anthem said it would no longer offer Obamacare plans in Nevada’s state exchange and half of Georgia’s counties in 2018. The company said on Friday it will only offer off-exchange plans in Washington and Scott counties and the city of Bristol. Hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as health insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months. ","

500,,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"(Reuters) - Centene Corp, one of the largest players in the Obamacare individual insurance market, said it would offer Obamacare plans in Nevada in 2018. Nevada was left without insurance coverage after U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc said last week it would pare back its Obamacare offerings in the state exchange next year. Centene said its SilverSummit Healthplan would cover all 17 counties of Nevada, including the “bare counties” that were expected not to have coverage by any other health insurers in 2018. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty over the healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seek to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Centene is among the few large-cap health insurers that have not exited the individual insurance market despite Republican lawmakers’ persistent efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. In June, the company said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018.

501,,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"GENEVA (Reuters) - More than half a million people in Yemen have been infected with cholera since the epidemic began four months ago and 1,975 people have died, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday. Each day there are more than 5,000 new cases of the waterborne disease, which causes acute diarrhoea and dehydration, in the country where the health system has collapsed after more than two years of war, it said. “The total number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen this year hit the half a million mark on Sunday, and nearly 2,000 people have died since the outbreak began to spread rapidly at the end of April,” the WHO said in a statement on Monday. “The spread of cholera has slowed significantly in some areas compared to peak levels but the disease is still spreading fast in more recently affected districts, which are recording large numbers of cases,” it said, reporting a total of 503,484 cases. The disease, spread by ingestion of food or water tainted with human faeces, can kill within hours if untreated. It has been largely eradicated in developed countries equipped with sanitation systems and water treatment. But Yemen’s devastating civil war, pitting a Saudi-led military coalition against the Iran-backed armed Houthi group, and economic collapse has made it extremely difficult to deal with catastrophes such as cholera and mass hunger. Millions of Yemenis remain cut off from clean water and waste collection has ceased in major cities, the WHO added. Yemen’s 30,000 critical health workers have not been paid salaries in nearly a year and critical medicines are lacking, the WHO said. “These doctors and nurses are the backbone of the health response – without them we can do nothing in Yemen. They must be paid their wages so that they can continue to save lives,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. WHO and partners are working around the clock to set up cholera treatment clinics, rehabilitate health facilities, deliver medical supplies and support the national effort, the United Nations agency said. More than 99 percent of patients who reach health facilities survive but children and the elderly are most vulnerable. “The response is working in some places. We can tell you that surveillance confirms a decline in suspected cases over the past four weeks in some of the most affected governorates,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing last Friday. “Most notably Sanaa city, Hajja and Amran are consistent with his decline. But in many other districts, cases and deaths persist and are on the rise.” ","

502, ,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"DEADLY AGENT: A sarin attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta killed hundreds of men, women and children in August, 2013. Despite international condemnation, attacks with chemicals continue. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Nearly four years after President Bashar al-Assadâs government promised to get rid of its stockpile of chemical weapons, gas attacks are still commonplace. What went wrong? By  Anthony Deutsch Filed Aug. 17, 2017, 10 a.m. GMT THE HAGUE â In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit. When they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals. âLook, there is nothing to see,â said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door. So why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building. The incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syriaâs weapons of mass destruction. Related content Slideshow: An invisible enemy Video: Anthony Deutsch on how he uncovered the problems facing weapons inspectors in Syria Video: Interview with Angela Kane, former UN high representative for disarmament Timeline: U.N.-OPCW investigations Â into Syrian chemical weapons Syria investigator del Ponte quits, blaming U.N. Security Council A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. They suspect that President Bashar al-Assadâs regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled. There have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone. âThe cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and thatâs a polite way of describing it,â Angela Kane, who was the United Nationâs high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. âWere they happily collaborating? No.â âWhat has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,â she added. That frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. âI have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,â she said. âWe are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.â The extent of Syriaâs reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectorsâ relationship with Assadâs administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters: - Syriaâs declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors.Â Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin. - Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not âscientifically credible.â Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said. âWhy, my God, three-and-a-half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that, I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people.â - At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syriaâs military. - In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, threeÂ sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syriaâs chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syriaâs disclosures. ""There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,"" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters. But he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job âto ensure the full complianceâ of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame. Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the countryâs cooperation with international inspectors. âI assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,â he told Reuters in an interview. Sharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse. SARIN ATTACK On Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assadâs forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil.â In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assadâs government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to openÂ its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme â after previously denying it had any chemical weapons. Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States. But there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used. And in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syriaâs foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy. Reuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters. The OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said. The second problem was a switch of tactics by Assadâs forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assadâs forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine. Â Although less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorineâs use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United NationsÂ to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids. A source involved in monitoring Syriaâs chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as âa weapon of terrorâ to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014. âThe base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. Thatâs why they started using chlorine,â said the source. A senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.

The Syrian armed forces denied using chemical weapons. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syriaâs chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syriaâs declaredÂ stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said. OPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. ItÂ concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. Uzumcu said the teamâs conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban. Kane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the governmentâs Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programmeâs headquarters. âWhy, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,â Kane said. Uzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of aÂ separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,â Uzumcu said. He said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence. Uzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syriaâs membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation. Uzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syriaâs chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities. POLITICAL DEADLOCK The Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council. In 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacksÂ but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan. The United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks. Western governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change. Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment. SARIN FOUND Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said. A key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives âTo my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombsâ payload,â said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was âa real, high-level, command structure behind this.â Syrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs. The team is also examining the deaths Â of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, said in the interview Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem. Sellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. âIs there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?â he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well. The attack means either âthat someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,â Sellstrom said. 2013U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reach an agreement on the elimination of Syriaâs chemical weapons. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon establishes United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. Headed by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom and comprised of experts from the World Health Organization and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), it is tasked with looking into possible use of chemical weapons following reports of an attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal. It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds. 2014OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syriaâs declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can ânot fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.â OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, âto establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.â The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. It is not tasked with assigning blame. 2015United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria is established to identify individuals or entities behind chemical weapons attacks. 2016Joint Investigative Mechanism concludes that Syrian government forces used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three cases and that Islamic State militants used sulphur mustard. OPCW executive council adopts decision condemning Syrian government and Islamic State for chemical weapons use after a vote that split the body and signaled an end to U.S.-Russia cooperation. 2017OPCW Fact Finding Mission concludes that sarin was used in an April 4 attack in the Khan Sheikhoun area of northern Syria, the most deadly use of the nerve agent in three years. It does not assign blame.

503, ,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"“We are looking for partners ... a series of partners. It’s not to fund the whole pipeline, just some projects in it. A small part of it,” Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told Reuters in an email on Wednesday. Israel’s Teva needs extra financial firepower to develop new drugs and has few options left other than striking alliances with big pharma players, sources familiar with the company said. “Teva will avoid injecting any extra funding in new drugs,” one of the sources said. “They will partner with other big pharmas and share the proceeds.” Earlier this month the world’s largest generics drugmaker, which is facing price erosion in the United States, reported a steeper than expected drop in second-quarter earnings, slashed its dividend by 75 percent and cut its 2017 forecast. A loss of confidence in the company’s management have led to a nearly 50 percent drop in Teva’s shares since Aug. 3, while losses are about 75 percent since the start of 2016. Investors say Teva paid too much for Actavis, prompting Chief Executive Erz Vigodman’s resignation in February and his temporary replacement by Chairman Yitzhak Peterburg, while Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of June, again with only an interim stand-in. “People have lost faith in Teva not for what happened, but we don’t see where its going,” Eldad Tamir, head of the Tamir Fishman Investment House, said. In addition to seeking partners, Teva is responding by speeding up plans to divest non-core assets, the sources said, with long-term decisions including a possible break-up into two companies, generics and specialty drugs, only likely to be discussed after it fills its leadership vacuum. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have been asked to find buyers for Teva’s women’s health business and European oncology and pain unit, respectively. A source familiar with the divestments said that India’s Intas, which last year bought the generics business of Actavis in the UK and Ireland from Teva, is now bidding for specific assets within the women’s health unit, adding Teva is open to a break-up to speed up the sale. This means the business could be sold in two or three chunks with its U.S. and international operations being chopped and some products like contraceptive drugs Plan B and Paragard being carved out and sold separately, the sources said. The oncology business could also be broken up as industry players are mainly interested in pure cancer drugs while pain treatment medicine, which is being offered as part of the same deal, is seen as less attractive, the sources said. The prospect of a piecemeal deal has drawn interest from private equity funds including Advent and TPG, the sources said. Fresenius, Mylan and Advent declined to comment while Intas Advent and TPG were not immediately available for comment. Teva is also considering options for its respiratory treatments business as part of a review of its entire portfolio, the sources said. It recently decided to part ways with Iceland-based Medis, a supplier of development work to third-party drugmakers, which one source said could fetch about $500 million. Some shareholders have called on Teva to either split into two or sell off its generics business completely. “Teva should get out of generics. It means splitting the company of course, selling the generics in pieces and focusing on specialty drugs,” Benny Landa, an entrepreneur who in 2014 led an investor bid to shake up Teva’s board, said. Teva should become more like research-focused Novartis NOVM.S and its generics unit Sandoz, which are run as two separate firms, he added. But such changes could be slowed by Teva’s articles of association. These were designed to prevent a hostile takeover and include provisions that limit the number of board members to be replaced per year to a third of all seats. Teva’s problems also stem in large part from its specialty business. Its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone had contributed much of Teva’s revenue and profit, but its patent has run out and now is facing generic competition.

504, ,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"BUSIA, Uganda (Reuters) - The number of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda hit one million on Thursday, the United Nations said, as hundreds of desperate families pour across the border every day seeking a haven from the civil war. The conflict in South Sudan has created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and U.N. agencies are receiving a fraction of the cash they need to provide food and shelter. But the crowds keep flowing across rickety wooden bridges near the northwestern Ugandan border town of Busia, staggering under the weight of babies and a few pots or bundles of clothing balanced on their heads. Women and children make up more than 85 percent of the arrivals. “Two weeks ago my husband’s uncle was killed,” said Stella Taji, as she trudged barefoot over the bridge, a toddler clinging to her hand. “Since then we’ve been hiding in the bush. We have nothing.” Oil-rich South Sudan became the world’s youngest nation in 2011, upon its independence from neighboring Sudan, but the elation soon evaporated amid corruption and ethnic divisions. Troops loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, and forces under former vice president Riek Machar, from the Nuer ethnic group, have battled each other since late 2013, killing tens of thousands and forcing nearly a third of the population of 12 million to flee their homes. The trickle of refugees into Uganda swelled into a river last year after a shaky Western-backed peace deal between Kiir and Machar collapsed within months. The conflict has further fragmented since, breeding a patchwork of militias and briefly plunging parts of the country into famine this year. No one knows how many have died, but an August report by South Africa-based South Sudan Human Rights Observatory said 987 civilians were killed in violence across South Sudan between May and July, mostly by government forces. “They are slaughtering people with knives,” said Samuel Amule, who trekked for two days to the border to escape government attacks. “They say, ‘If you are staying here, you are a rebel.’” The U.N. says homes have been burned with families locked inside, gang rapes are common and boys are often kidnapped to be child soldiers. Gunmen, including South Sudanese rebels, rob those trying to escape. In Uganda, South Sudanese refugees receive hot meals, vaccinations, and plots of land. All can enter and they are free to travel and work in Uganda, policies that have drawn praise from aid groups. “The government response to accepting the South Sudanese refugees has been overwhelmingly positive, progressive, and welcoming,” said Sacha Manov, deputy director in Uganda for the International Rescue Committee, which provides health and protection services for refugees. But refugee agency UNHCR said Uganda was struggling to provide food and shelter. Donor nations have not given enough, with the U.N. agency having received just about 21 percent of the $674 million needed for South Sudanese refugees in Uganda in 2017, its spokesman, Charlie Yaxley, said. “That’s leaving significant gaps in the abilities of the humanitarian response to deliver lifesaving assistance and also key basic services,” he added. In Amugo camp, new arrivals sleep under loose white tarpaulins as they lack the tools to build proper shelters. Latrines are unfinished, forcing refugees to use nearby forests as toilets. In May, a cash crunch forced the U.N. to slash food rations in half, to 6 kg (13 lb) of maize. They have since been restored but funding remains tenuous. There is no end in sight to the conflict; international peacemaking efforts have stalled, said South Sudan analyst Alan Boswell. The United States, which played a key role previous negotiations, has not yet appointed a top official for Africa. “It’s been two years since the last serious political process,” said Boswell. “There is none on the horizon.” ","

505, ,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - South Korea lifted a ban on imports of U.S. poultry and eggs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday, allowing American farmers to resume sales to the Asian country that suffered an egg shortage caused by its worst-ever bird flu outbreak. South Korea was importing more U.S. eggs earlier this year as it fought its own outbreak of bird flu. But in March, the country limited U.S. poultry imports after the first U.S. case of bird flu of the year was detected on a commercial chicken farm in Tennessee. Prior to that, Americans “were putting table eggs in there like they were going out of style,” said Jim Sumner, president of the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, a trade group. “They are in desperate need still,” he said. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, was hit hard by the deadly H5N8 bird flu strain after the first case was confirmed in November, leading to a record culling of more than 37 million farm birds, more than a fifth of its total poultry population. Last month, South Korea’s government downgraded its bird flu alert by one notch from the highest level, after more than a month passed without new cases. South Korea bans U.S. poultry imports when the United States detects any cases of bird flu. The USDA is now working to convince South Korean officials to limit future restrictions on shipments to the geographic regions in which the virus is detected. “Korea’s lifting of its most recent ban is an important move for our poultry and egg industries, but it is still just the first step,” USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. In 2014, the last full year without any bird flu-related U.S. trade restrictions in place, South Korea purchased $122 million in U.S. poultry products, including eggs, making it the United States’ tenth-largest market, according to the USDA. Last year, South Korea’s imports from all countries exceeded $350 million in 2016, but only $39 million came from the United States. ","

506, ,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of people uprooted by violence in Central African Republic are taking refuge in a hospital after armed groups looted and burned a camp for the displaced, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Thursday. At least 10,000 people are staying on the grounds of the hospital in the town of Batangafo - 400 kilometres (250 miles) north of the capital Bangui - nearly two weeks after fighting broke out between rival groups, according to the charity. The camp for the displaced was attacked and several aid groups were looted during two waves of violence which left 24 people dead and 17 injured as of the start of August, MSF said. “The people taking refuge in the hospital ... are still unable to rebuild their shelters in the camp,” MSF project coordinator Carlos Francisco said in a statement. The medical charity said it was providing basic water and sanitation services for the displaced, and that health services were running as normal after being disrupted by the fighting. “Much of the general population is in a state of complete helplessness,” Francisco added. “Imagine what the situation must be like when people think that the only safe option left to them is a hospital ... knowing that not even hospitals are safe.” Hospitals in the southeastern towns of Bangassou and Zemio have been targeted by militant groups in recent months - with armed men abducting two patients who were later found dead, and shooting and killing a baby being held by its mother, MSF said. Six Red Cross volunteers were killed last week in an attack on a health centre in southeastern Gambo, the aid group said, adding that civilians and health workers may have also died. Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans - nearly 1 million - have fled their homes in an ethnic and religious conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian militias. Militia violence has intensified across Central African Republic this year as splinter groups clash over control of land and resources, sparking fears of a return to the large-scale chaos that gripped the country at the peak of a 2013 civil war. United Nations aid chief Stephen O’Brien on Monday told a U.N. briefing that the “warning signs of genocide are there”. O’Brien last month told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the country has “the worst level of humanitarian needs per capita’, as about one in two people - 2.2 million - need aid. ","

507, ,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"DANDONG, China (Reuters) - Undeterred by escalating tensions between Pyongyang and Washington rattling nerves globally, a steady stream of tourists from China each morning passes through the immigration checkpoint at the border trading hub of Dandong. Greeting them on the North Korean side are dozens of tour buses, collecting them for itineraries ranging from a day in neighbouring Sinijiu to a week visiting North Korea’s main cities, including the capital Pyongyang. “We’re curious. We want to see how they live,” Xu Juan said on Thursday before crossing the Yalu River, which marks the border between the two countries. Xu was travelling with friends and family from Hangzhou, in eastern China. “I just want the sense of nostalgia, to see a country that is poor, like (China was) when I was young,” said a man in his early 50s, from Jilin province, declining to give his name. Few expressed concern over the North’s persistent missile tests in recent months, which led the United Nations Security Council on Saturday to impose tough new sanctions against Pyongyang. North Korea dismissed on Thursday warnings by U.S. President Donald Trump that it would face “fire and fury” if it threatened the United States as a “load of nonsense”, and outlined plans for a missile strike near the Pacific territory of Guam. But tour operators said their industry remains robust. Traffic, especially on lower-end group tours, has grown steadily to one of the world’s most isolated states over the past few years, despite North Korea’s persistent nuclear and missile tests, which have drawn ever-tightening U.N. sanctions. A flyer for the one-day tour to Sinijiu tout a trip to the city’s central plaza, where you can pay respects to a bronze statue of North Korea’s founding president Kim il-Sung, as well as visits to a cosmetics factory, a revolutionary history museum, art history museum and a cultural park. “You can feast on the North Korean speciality food by warm and hospitable North Koreans,” it says. China’s tourism authority has not published a breakdown of the total number of Chinese visitors to North Korea since 2012, when it said 237,000 made the trip. But the number travelling just from Dandong spiked to 580,000 in the second half of 2016 alone, according to the state-run China News Service. The report said 85 percent of Chinese tourist visits to North Korea originated from Dandong. That’s still only a fraction of the 8 million Chinese who visited South Korea in 2016. Tourists can take ferries or charter speedboats down the Yalu for an up-close peek at North Korean villages and patrolling border guards. One tour operator targeting wealthier, more adventurous travellers said it was receiving more inquiries in recent weeks over whether it was safe to travel. “But those that inquire often already have their heart set on going,” the operator, who declined to be named, told Reuters. “The idea of a bit of danger adds to the thrill and mystery of North Korea.” Another tour guide, Teng Yi, said that while some may be deterred by tensions on the Korean peninsula, it was prompting others to get to North Korea while they still can. “There have been quite a few tourists in my groups who say they want to see North Korea in its reclusive state while they can,” he said. “It won’t be the same if the regime collapses.” ","

The employee remains on the payroll but is neither permitted to go to work nor to commence any other employment whilst on gardening leave. Gardening leave is a term most commonly used in the UK. Because gardening leave often prevents the employee from involvement in any work for their current employer, and typically restricts them from either taking on another job or working for themselves, an employee is likely to spend their time pursuing hobbies such as gardening. Gardening leave is sometimes considered to be a euphemism for being suspended, and can be perceived to have negative connotations, such as the employee being unfit for anything other than tending their garden. Following the resignation or dismissal of an employee, an employer may decide to place the employee on gardening leave. The primary reason for doing so is to safe-guard against possible detrimental actions or behavior that the employee might indulge in during his or her notice period. The employer may fear that the employee could be uncooperative, or that they may negatively influence the working environment and other employees. The employer may also prefer that the employee limit contact with clients for fear that the employee may persuade the clients to follow the employee to his or her new employer. Another reason for implementing a gardening leave is that the employee may have access to up-to-date information which could be beneficial to the employer’s competitors. Placing an employee on gardening leave could help to ensure that by the time the employee is contractually free, he or she would have been out of the loop long enough to reduce this threat.

511,Dan Mangan,8172017,CNBC,8102017,"The Trump administration refused Monday to commit to partnering with outside groups to promote enrollment in Obamacare health plans, potentially reversing four years of those cooperative efforts. The administration's stance, coupled with its similar refusal to commit to key Obamacare subsidies to insurers through next year, could result in fewer people signing up for health coverage in the individual insurance plans for 2018 after open enrollment starts in November. And if those subsidies, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, are ended, insurers could end up charging individual plan customers much higher premiums next year. For the past four years each fall, the Obama administration had coordinated its open-enrollment promotion efforts with a wide array of churches, advocacy groups and private companies. Those efforts seemed to be at risk with the election of avowed Obamacare opponent Donald Trump as president last November. Trump was inaugurated shortly before the end of open enrollment in individual health plans for 2017. The federal Health and Human Services Department, which had been Obamacare's biggest booster, immediately began reversing enrollment promotion efforts for the little time that remained in the sign-up season. That pullback may have contributed to the first-ever drop in enrollment in Obamacare plans. On Monday, a story on the news site Talking Points Memo reported there was no sign that the Trump administration would work with outside groups this fall to encourage people to sign up for health insurance for 2018. That's despite the fact the Affordable Care Act requires nearly all Americans to have some form of health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Amanda Hooper, the National Women's Law Center's director of engagement and mobilization, told CNBC that ""we have no indication from them that there will be reach out,"" as the Obama administration did with that organization every year since 2013. ""It is the silence that is speaking volumes,"" said Hooper, noting that the Obama administration would start reaching out to the law center and other groups in the summer to prepare for the fall enrollment season. ""We are very interested in hearing what their plans are,"" Hooper said of the Trump administration. CNBC reached out to HHS and asked whether the Trump administration would end the long-standing partnership, and, if so, why. In response, HHS spokeswoman Alleigh Marrè said, ""As Obamacare continues to collapse, the administration is considering its options on how to address the challenges Americans are facing by cancelled plans, higher costs, and failing markets."" Hooper said that even if the Trump administration doesn't want help from the National Women's Law Center in boosting Obamacare enrollment, the group will continue outreach efforts on its own to potential insurance customers. ""We will be sure to get the message to clarify for people that [Obamacare] is still here, and you should still sign up ... we will let people know when to sign up,"" Hooper said. ""Obamacare is the law of the land."" She said that in past years her group, which received no federal funding for its Obamacare promotion efforts, worked in tandem with other advocacy groups to encourage sign-ups. One example of that was a Facebook Live event in December hosted by the NWLC, with participation from the Center for American Progress, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and Raising Women's Voices, as well as two members of the Obama administration. ""The video reached 168,000 people and has been viewed 16,000 times,"" Hooper said. In addition to being coy about its open-enrollment promotion strategy, the Trump administration has refused to say whether the cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments will continue being made to insurers through 2018. Those CSR payments, worth billions of dollars, compensate insurers for discounts in out-of-pocket health-care charges offered to low- and middle-income Obamacare customers. Trump has threatened to end the CSR payments. But if the payments end, insurers would still be legally responsible for giving the discounts to qualified customers, cutting into the insurers' bottom lines. That, in turn, would lead insurers to seek higher premiums from customers to cover their operating costs. Late last week, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Obamacare, gave insurers almost three extra weeks to submit their proposed prices for individual 2018 plans because of the lack of certainty about the CSRs. The new deadline for proposed Obamacare premiums is now Sept. 5. Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release a report Tuesday that will outline the risks of terminating the CSR payments. The analysis, which is being done in conjunction with the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, will look at the impact on the federal budget, health insurance coverage, market stability and premiums. The Cleveland Plain Dealer on Saturday reported that insurers in Ohio have begun filing new, much-higher premium rate increase requests with state regulators in case Trump ends the CSR payments. The newspaper noted that insurers already were asking for price hikes averaging 20 percent or more for next year. But the state insurance department asked for new requests that assume an end to CSR payments, as well as other factors. One insurer, Molina Healthcare of Ohio, said last week that it wants to add an extra 21.4 percent average price increase on top of its existing request of a 24 percent increase, according to the Plain Dealer. Paramount Insurance filed an average rate hike of 35.9 percent assuming an end to the CSRs, and Summa said it would need to raise prices of its most popular individual plans by an average of 41.1 percent, the newspaper said.

512,Patti Domm,8172017,CNBC,8102017,"Talks that could set the tone for every other trade deal during the Trump administration start Wednesday, when Mexican and Canadian officials sit down in Washington to discuss the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement that President Donald Trump had one time vowed to tear up. Analysts say the odds are good the three sides will successfully update NAFTA by next year. Just resolving the technology issues alone will be a huge undertaking, since the agreement was written when cellphones were close to the size of a brick and there was no digital economy. At the crux of the talks, initiated by the U.S., is Trump's concern that the U.S. has not been fairly treated under NAFTA, and China has been able to use the agreement as a backdoor to slip its goods into North America. One sore point for Trump has been that Mexico is running a more than $60 billion trade surplus with the U.S. ""For Mexico and Canada, a lot of their trade really is dependent on the U.S. Canada is the U.S. top trading partner, and after that it would be China. There's a lot at stake here. We've seen how the Trump administration negotiates. They kind of present the stick first and the carrot later,"" said Dana Peterson, U.S. and Canada economist at Citigroup. The U.S. had a $12.5 billion surplus with Canada in 2016, and it traded $628 billion in goods and services with the U.S. last year, compared with Mexico's $580 billion. The negotiations are also a major test for the Trump administration, which has failed so far to win a legislative victory at home. ""I think as the administration struggle to put points on the political scoreboard, there's going to be a lot of focus on the renegotiation of NAFTA as a key indicator to move their agenda forward,"" said Jonathan Lieber, head of Eurasia Group's U.S. practice. Lieber said the problem for the Trump administration is it will be hard to look like a winner on a new NAFTA deal. ""If they put barriers on Mexican exports, they're going to have members of Congress condemning what they've done. It's going to be hard for them to spin it into a political victory,"" he said. Analysts say the U.S. wish list for NAFTA looks a lot like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was a trade agreement that Trump opposed as a candidate and then threw out once he became president. The 12-nation deal included countries in the Western Hemisphere but also partners in Asia like Japan and Singapore. ""I think the likely outcome based on the body language so far is they get a minor rewrite of NAFTA to include some of the TPP-like rules,"" said Lieber. The sectors that benefited the most from NAFTA are the automotive, agricultural and energy industries and they stand to lose the most of it falls apart. The automotive industry supply chain spans the three countries, with Mexico now a huge producer of both cars and parts. Peterson said the best case is that the negotiations wind up in six to eight sessions by December, and then be fast tracked so that it would be adopted before both the U.S. and Mexican elections next year. ""The worst-case scenario, which we assign a 10 percent probability, is someone exits, or the U.S. backs out,"" Peterson said. Timing is also critical since the Mexican election next year could result in a different party in control that might decide to scuttle the talks, and there's also congressional elections in the U.S. ""For Mexico, the main objective is to continue guaranteeing that Mexico has market access to the United States,"" said Juan Carlos Hartasanchez, senior director at Albright Stonebridge. He said Mexico wants to protect what is now in place in terms of no tarrifs, quotas or managed trade. There are a few potential hurdles to a deal. One is a U.S. demand to change the way disputes are resolved. Instead of going to a panel made up of representatives of the three countries, U.S. negotiators are seeking to change the rule and open the door for resolution elsewhere, including U.S. courts. Canada and Mexico disagree. ""The Trump administration wants to have all options to protect U.S. trade,"" said Peterson. If the rule is changed, countries might then slap tariffs on offenders even before the cases are resolved. The U.S. would also like to raise the level of duty-free import limits for e-commerce to the U.S. level of $800. Current threshold for Mexico is $50 and for Canada, just $20. Canadian retailers worry that e-commerce vendors will offer cheaper prices, and Mexicans are concerned such a move would open the door for cheap imports from Asia. This would be favorable for eBay and Amazon if adopted. Another concern for Mexico and Canada is the U.S. push to put America first, and buy American. ""[Canada] wants greater access to government procurement contracts while the U.S. wants to restrict it and focus more on producing goods and services within the U.S. with people in the U.S.,"" Peterson said. Canada also opposes U.S. efforts to limit the free flow of workers across borders, and the U.S. is complicating its relationship with Mexico by moving ahead with efforts to build a wall on the border, to help bar immigrants from entering. The U.S. would also like to refocus the country of origin rules, which now require 40 percent content to be made in the country. ""If you look at the U.S. objections in detail, they discuss rules of origin by stating that the new rules of origin should be reviewed to guarantee U.S. and North American products. They focus first on the U.S. which would be first thing for bilateral but you're trying to strengthen the region. If they push toward U.S. rules of origin that might complicate the negotiations,"" said Hartasanchez. ""If the conversation from the U.S. focuses on trying to reduce that trade deficit, through limiting, or high and unrealistic rules of origination, then we could be in a pretty bad situation. Mexico will have no other alternative than to walk away from the negotiations altogether,"" Hartasanchez said. As part of the TPP, Mexico had agreed to environmental and labor changes that could put it more on par with the U.S., and Lieber said this could be a positive opening. In Mexico, ""The infrastructure has improved but the wages haven't so you still have employees in Michigan making $30 an hour with health-care benefits competing against someone making $5 in Mexico without health care,"" Lieber said. ""If you can upscale some of the environmental rules you have in Canada and the United States, in Mexico, then suddenly you have a more level playing field for workers in the three countries."" There is also friction between the U.S. and Canada over dairy products and soft lumber, which the U.S. is now taxing at the border. ""The U.S. objects to Canada having subsidies for dairy. Canada's argument has been the amount of U.S. exports to Canada are five times what Canada is shipping to the U.S.,"" Peterson said. ",NAFTA talks are a major trade test for Trump,0.9962

Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they are leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside and I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. Reporter: Why did you wait so long to put that last statement out? Trump: I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. Reporter: It was at least 48 hours. Trump: I wanted to make sure — unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct. Not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts, and it's a very, very important process to me, and it's a very important statement, so I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to — I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. As I said — remember this, Saturday — we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America, and then I went on from there. Now, here's the thing. Excuse me, excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here's the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet, as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts, so I don't want to rush into a statement. So, making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman — and it was on NBC — her mother wrote me and said — through I guess Twitter, social media — the nicest things, and I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine, really actually an incredible young woman. But her mother on Twitter thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you and unlike — excuse me — unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement I like to know the facts. Trump: They don't. They don't. Trump: Listen, how about- how about a couple of infrastructure questions? Reporter: Was that terrorism, that event? Was that terrorism? Trump: Say it. What? Reporter: The CEO of Wal-Mart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you? Trump: Not at all. I think the country — look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I'm president. The country is booming, the stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. We're doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So, the head of Wal-Mart, whom I know, who is a very nice guy, was making a political statement. I mean, I do it the same way. You know why? Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement that the statement is correct, and there was no way — there was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters — unlike a lot of reporters. I know, David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts, and the facts as they started coming out were very well-stated. In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good. I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts. It was very important — excuse me, excuse me. It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly, because if I would have made a fast statement — and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made with knowledge, with great knowledge. There's still things — excuse me, there's still things that people don't know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts. Okay. Reporter: Two questions. Was this terrorism and can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Trump: Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and this country, and that is ... you can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That's what I'd call it. Because there is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? And then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer and what he did was a horrible, horrible inexcusable thing. Reporter: Can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that? Trump: Go ahead. Reporter: I would echo Maggie's question. Steve Bannon has- Trump: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it. Reporter: Can you tell us broadly — do you still have confidence in Steve? Trump: Well, we'll see. Look, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late — you know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person, he actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly. Reporter: Do you have confidence in him? Another reporter: John McCain has called on you to defend your national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Trump: I have already done it. I did it the last time. Reporter: And he called on you again to — Trump: Senator McCain? You mean the one who voted against Obamacare? Reporter: And he said- Trump: Who is senator- You mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care? Reporter: Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville. Trump: Well, I don't know. I can't tell you. I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he's talking about. But when you say the alt-right...uh, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead. Trump: No, define it for me. Come on, let's go. Reporter: Senator McCain defined them as the same groups. Trump: OK. What about the alt-left that came charging at- Trump: Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right. Do they have any semblance of guilt? Trump: Let me ask you this. What about the fact they came charging — that they came charging, with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. So, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day- Trump: Wait a minute. I'm not finished. I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day. Reporter: Is it the same level as neo-Nazis? Trump: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it, and you have- You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group, you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent. Trump: Go ahead. Reporter: Do you think what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis? Trump: Those people, all of those people- excuse me. I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. Reporter: Well, white nationalists- Trump: Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee. So … Excuse me. And you take a look at some of the groups and you see and you'd know it if you were honest reporters — which in many cases you're not. But many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So, this week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself where does it stop? But they were there to protest- excuse me. you take a look the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of the Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead. Reporter: Should statues of Robert E. Lee stay up? Trump: I would say that's up to a local town, community, or the federal government depending on where it is located. Reporter: Are you against the Confederacy? Another reporter: How concerned are you about race relations in America and do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office? Trump: I think they have gotten better- or the same- I- look. They've been frayed for a long time, and you can ask President Obama about that because he'd make speeches about it. But, I believe that the fact that I brought in, it will be soon, millions of jobs — you see where companies are moving back into our country — I think that's going to have a tremendous positive impact on race relations. We have companies coming back into our country, we have two car companies that just announced, we have FoxConn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I say pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It's jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay and, when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I'll tell you, we're spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We're fixing the inner cities. We're doing far more than anybody's done with respect to the inner cities. It's a priority for me, and it's very important. Reporter: Mr. President, are you putting what you're calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? Trump: I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I'm saying is this: You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch, but there is another side. There was a group on this side — you can call them the left, you've just called them the left — that came violently attacking the other group, so you can say what you want but that's the way it is. Reporter: Mr. President, your words- Another reporter: You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides. Are there- Trump: Well, I do think there's blame- Yes. I do think there's blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it either and- and- and- and if you reported it accurately, you would say it. Reporter: Neo-Nazis started this in Charlottesville. They showed up at Charlottesville, they- Trump: Excuse me. Reporter: To protest the removal of that- Trump: [Inaudible.] You have some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group — excuse me, excuse me — I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. Reporter: Do you support white nationalists, then? Trump: Well, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So, will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down- Excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Reporter: I do love Thomas Jefferson- Trump: OK, good. Well, are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue? So, you know what? It's fine. You're changing history. You're changing culture and you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned, totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You got a lot of bad people in the other group, too. Reporter: Who was treated unfairly? Sir, I'm sorry I don't understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? I just don't understand what you were saying. Trump: No. No. There were people in that rally — and I looked the night before. If you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people: neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest — and very legally protest, because you know- I don't know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit. So, I only tell you this. There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final- does anybody- you have an infrastructure question. Reporter: What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn't get health care. You're- Trump: Well, you know, I'll tell you. We came very close with health care, unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You'll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to health care. We will end up getting health care. But we'll get the infrastructure and actually, infrastructure is something that I think we'll have bipartisan support on. I actually think- I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure. Reporter: Mr. President, have you spoken to the family- have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack? Trump: No, I'll be reaching out. I'll be reaching out. Reporter: When will you be reaching out? Trump: I was very — I thought that the statement put out, the mother's statement, I thought was a beautiful statement. I must tell you, I was- it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific, and really under the- under the kind of stress that she's under and the heartache that she's under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won't forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Reporter 1: What about the nazis who support you? Reporter 2: Do you plan on going to Charlottesville, Mr. President? Reporter 3: Do you think you're helping to heal the nation? Trump: I own a house in Charlottesville. Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville? Reporter: Where is it? Trump: Oh, boy, it's going to be- it's in Charlottesville, you'll see. Reporter: Is it in the winery or something? Trump: It's a- it is the winery. Trump: I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a great place that's been very badly hurt over the last couple of days. I own- I own actually one of the largest wineries in the United States that's in Charlottesville. Reporter: What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country? Trump: Well I really think jobs can have a big impact. I think if we continue to create jobs — over a million, substantially more than a million — and you can see just the other day, the car companies coming in with fox- you know, FoxConn. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm- that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendous impact, positive impact on race relations. Reporter: And what you said today, how do you think that will impact the racial- Trump: Because people are going to be working, they're going to be making a lot of money, much more money than they ever thought possible. Reporter: -your remarks today. Trump: And the other thing, very important, I believe wages will start going up. They haven't gone up for a long time. I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up. I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. Thank you. ",Read the transcript of Donald Trump's jaw-dropping press conference,0.9851
515,"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com",8172017,CNBC,8102017,"No matter how advanced medical technology gets, for many patients modern health care begins in a hospital emergency room and ends with an unexpectedly huge bill. On average, emergency-room bills for out-of-network care is 4.4 times higher than what Medicare allows for the same services, costing consumers more than $3 billion a year, according to a nationwide study by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine. Put another way, emergency medicine physician charges came to about $4 billion versus $898 million in Medicare allowable amounts. Overall, the study found that emergency departments are charging anywhere from 1.0–12.6 times ($100–$12,600) more than what Medicare pays for services. The greatest disparities were for those who lack insurance or have to go to a facility that's not in their health plan's network.  The biggest overcharges were made to poor and minority patients, and the biggest gaps between charges for Medicare and uninsured patients were at for-profit hospitals, mostly in the Southeast and Midwest, the study said. The service with the highest median markup ratio? Wound closures, at 7.0, while interpreting head CT scans had the greatest within-hospital pricing variation, with markup ratios ranging between 1.6 and 27. General internal medicine physicians had a markup rate, compared to Medicare pricing, less than half what is billed by ER physicians. For a physician review of an electrocardiogram, the median Medicare allowable rate is $16, but emergency departments charged anywhere from $18 to $317, with a median charge of $95 (or a markup ratio of 6.0), the Johns Hopkins study found. General internal medicine doctors in hospitals charged an average of $62 for the same service. For the study, researchers analyzed the Medicare billing records for 12,337 emergency medicine physicians practicing in almost 300 hospitals in all 50 states in 2013 to determine how much emergency departments billed for services compared to the Medicare allowable amount (the sum of what Medicare pays, the deductible and coinsurance that patients pay, and the amount any third party such as the patient pays). More from Modern Medicine:The data that's fueling Joe Biden's cancer moonshot Google's role in an emerging war against killer mosquitoes Crisis in America: The organ transplant shortage ER care may be the one place in the health system where consumers ask the fewest questions and get exploited on price the most, says Martin Makary, a Hopkins surgeon and professor of public health policy who was the lead investigator for the study. ""This is consistent with outlier stories we've always heard about seeking care out of network,'' Makary said. ""Generally, these patients feeling like they're being treated as if they did something wrong. We can't expect people to live within a local network bubble and never leave."" The Johns Hopkins' data tracks a troubling pattern when it comes to ER billing. Health policy journal Health Affairs found in a 2016 study that 1 in 5 inpatient emergency-room cases result in surprise bills. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey last year found that among insured, non-elderly adults struggling to pay medical bills, charges from out-of-network providers were a contributing factor one-third of the time. And 7 in 10 individuals with unaffordable out-of-network medical bills did found that the provider wasn't in their plan's network when they received care. The surprise bills are not going away. One reason: An investigation last month by the New York Times, including work done by Yale University researchers, found that some hospitals are outsourcing emergency-room services to out-of-network doctors groups and for-profit companies that aggressively hike prices. ""This is a huge problem,"" said Jenifer Bosco, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. ""Consumers are being overcharged, sometimes exorbitantly."" The real questions for consumers are: What can they do to prevent overcharges? How can they fight back? What rights do they have that they may not know about? The advice is slightly different for insured and uninsured patients, Bosco said. Families with incomes low enough to qualify for the Medicaid expansion or for Obamacare subsidies have rights that don't always apply to wealthier patients. Here are some key steps to protect yourself. 1. Get to a nonprofit hospital, if at all possible. Depending on the emergency, this may not be practical, experts concede. But a provision of the Affordable Care Act, which wasn't yet in force in 2013, requires nonprofit hospitals to have written financial assistance policies and to limit charges for those who qualify for financial assistance to no more than the rates generally paid by other insurers, usually the Medicare rate, said Marie Watteau, a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association. ""Hospital payments will vary because they reflect each individual hospital and the unique care needs of the patient population it serves,"" Watteau said in a statement. ""One community may have sicker patients with more chronic illness, while another may care for more uninsured patients. Drawing information that is meaningful from a uniform set of charges is challenging because hospital care is individually tailored to each patient's needs."" For single Americans making $48,284 or less, or families with incomes below $92,000, this provision can limit the amount emergency rooms can charge, making a painful accident or illness hurt your wallet less. But for-profit hospitals aren't covered by the provision, Bosco said. 2. Ask for financial counseling at the ER. Hospitals routinely have this service available, and it can be the key to learning your rights. On top of the Obamacare provision covering nonprofit hospitals, Medicaid-eligible patients are able to apply for coverage up to 10 days retroactively, Bosco said. That can cover nearly all of the unexpected bills for patients who make less than Medicaid cutoffs, about $33,900 for a family of four. (The cap varies by state.) In addition, a counselor can explain that the ACA requires that Obamacare plans cover out-of-network ER care without co-pays over and above what in-network ERs charge — it's one of the essential health benefits the law requires subsidy-eligible plans to have. Most employer-provided plans have a similar provision. 3. After you get the bill, go back to the hospital or doctor and negotiate. It's well known that providers give insurers, both private and public, big breaks on quoted rates. Uninsured or out-of-network patients initially get billed at so-called chargemaster rates. But Makary and Bosco agree that hospitals will rarely dig in to get the full price when challenged. If they do, they risk getting nothing for their services, so they are likely to cut the price and negotiate a payment plan. In addition, hospitals are getting better about prominently posting their financial-assistance policies in ERs, Bosco said. ""It's not a great solution,"" Bosco said. ""But patients with a low income can ask for the Medicare or Medicaid rate.''

516,"Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com",8172017,CNBC,8102017,"There is an emerging biotech movement that promises to transform medical science and radically overhaul the arduous process of bringing new drugs, foods and cosmetics to market. Teams of academic and government researchers and a handful of start-ups have created human organs-on-chips — miniaturized versions of livers, lungs, kidneys, intestines and other vital innards. The nascent science, now being evaluated by the FDA, offers a less time-consuming and costly way to test drugs, foods, cosmetics and dietary supplements for efficacy and toxicity, with the goal of vastly improving upon traditional cell culture and animal-based methods. It sounds futuristic, but it's not sci-fi. Each organ-on-a-chip, roughly the size of a AA battery, is made from a flexible, translucent polymer. Inside are tiny tubes, each less than a millimeter in diameter, lined with living human cells extracted from a particular organ. When nutrients, air, blood and test compounds, such as experimental drugs or cosmetic ingredients, are pumped through the tubes, the cells replicate some of the key functions of that organ, just as they do in the body. More from Modern Medicine:The cost of America's most expensive prescription drugs
Huge ER bills leave patients in shockScientists treat diabetes, obesity with genetically altered skin grafts Data published by FDAReview.org, a project of the nonpartisan Independent Institute, indicates that only about 1 in 10 drugs that enter clinical trials ultimately win Food and Drug Administration approval. According to the California Biomedical Research Association, it takes an average of 12 years for a drug to travel from preclinical research to the patient, at an average cost of $359 million. Do the math on the 90 percent of those drugs that don't make it and you can see the need for a revolutionary new approach. ""The current tools don't always give us the complete picture,"" said Geraldine Hamilton, president and chief scientific officer at Boston-based Emulate, a three-year-old private spin-off of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, a pioneer of organs-on-chips that has a multiyear R&D agreement with the FDA. ""When you put cells in a [petri] dish, they're in a static environment and don't interact with each other in the same way as they do in the body,"" she said, referring to a common preclinical first step. Tests on animal systems, Hamilton added, often do not accurately translate to those in humans, because of dissimilarities in our respective biologies. Emulate has combined design, engineering and biology to recreate a dynamic microenvironment housed within its organ chips. ""Think of the chip like a home away from home for an organ,"" Hamilton explained. ""We can control the way cells interact with each other by applying relevant mechanical forces."" For example, Emulate's lung chip can simulate breathing in and out. Blood and airflow are reproduced in the chip's tiny channels. Besides increasing the speed and accuracy of drug testing, organs-on-chips present a range of game-changing potentials. They can be embedded with a particular disease, such as cancer or asthma, and provide researchers with a cost-effective mini laboratory for introducing immune cells or drugs and observing reactions in real time. It's also possible to grow separate chips of a human gut, a cow gut and an insect gut and then compare how each species' intestines react to a pesticide, an implausible experiment using those actual animals. Further down the road are you-on-a-chip models containing stem cells, a key component in so-called personalized medicine, and an entire human-on-a-chip, linking every organ together to study holistic interactions between cells and tissues. Although Emulate is the first commercial organs-on-chips venture, this audacious biotech dates back to the late 1990s, when Michael Shuler, a professor at Cornell University's Department of Biomedical Engineering, coined the term ""animal-on-a-chip"" as part of his research to define the multidisciplinary field, which spans nano science, computational modeling, biomedical engineering, physiology, cell biology and surface chemistry. Shuler is now also president and CEO of Hesperos, an organ-chip start-up in Orlando, Florida. The company has developed separate cardiac and muscle chip systems and is partnering with clients to customize multi-organ chips. In 2010, Harvard's Wyss Institute, led by Donald Ingber, produced the first successful chip, a lung model. Two years later Ingber's lab was included in a public-private collaboration tasked with creating 10 different human organs-on-chips. The five-year program was backed by a $37 million grant from the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. In July 2014 and still at Harvard, Ingber founded Emulate, which raised $12 million in Series A funding from private investors. Last year Hamilton and 17 others left their Ivy League confines and set up shop in downtown Boston. The company has since raised an additional $45 million in a Series B round. NIH kicked in a $2 million grant this year, bringing Emulate's total funding to $57 million. Along with a lung chip, the company has developed liver and intestine models, Hamilton reported, and is working on the next generation, including brain, kidney and skin chips. Emulate is also creating a Human Emulation System, incorporating organ chips, testing instrumentation and software to collect and analyze data. ""That will allow this technology to be democratized,"" she said, ""so it can be used by researchers across industries — pharma, food, chemical, cosmetics — government agencies and academia. This is a lab-ready system that enables automation of our product platform."" Emulate plans to make the Human Emulation System available this year but in the meantime is actively partnering with several entities to further develop the basic technology platform capabilities and applications. They're working with Johnson & Johnson on a thrombosis chip to use in developing and testing drugs to treat or prevent blood clots that cause many life-threatening diseases, the Michael J. Fox Foundation to study safety of drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease and with Merck to model asthma and viral infection in the lung. ""We initially focused on the lung-on-a-chip platform,"" said Stephen Alves, director of Merck's immunology discovery group, ""to better evaluate the communication between the various cell types and disease processes of asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. We then expanded that to include the gut-on-a-chip to evaluate gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease."" The research is still in the exploratory mode, Alves noted, ""but we have demonstrated that you can pharmacologically manipulate aspects of disease. We hope we can move from the organ to a disease model on a chip."" Among Emulate's competitors is TissUse, a German spinoff of an organs-on-chips research program at the Technical University of Berlin's Institute of Biotechnology. Unlike Emulate's single organ chips, though, TissUse is producing ones with two or four organs on each. ""We focus on how to combine different organ models so they are able to interact with each other in a systemic manner,"" said Reyk Horland, vice president of business development at the company, which is jointly funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research and private investors. TissUse currently has custom-designed products on the market for preclinical R&D, with customers free to choose which organs to put on chips. ""We want to have the first fully functional human-on-a-chip prototype combining more than 10 organ models available next year,"" Horland disclosed. While this technology is extremely promising, using organ chips in human clinical trials is still a decade or so away. Ironically, a breakthrough that should accelerate the drug-approval process is subject to the rigorous regulatory system. In fact, even before the FDA considers okaying organ chips for clinical trials on new drugs, the agency recently signed a multiyear R&D agreement with Emulate to validate its organs-on-chips technology for possible use in testing ingredients in food, cosmetics and dietary supplements. The project will begin with a liver chip. ""The liver is particularly susceptible to organ toxicity, as it is the site of toxin filtration and metabolic breakdown, so we thought that the liver chip would be an appropriate place to start,"" said Robert Sprando, director of the Division of Toxicology in the Office of Applied Research and Safety Assessment at FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, referring to liver damage. The first step, however, is to verify the technology behind organ chips, he said. ""Initially, we have to do an evaluation of the technology, because one of the questions is, how can this be used in a regulatory environment?"" Different from academic research, regulatory research has to address public health standards. The FDA's meticulous approach to organs-on-chips is emblematic of the way science moves forward from the laboratory to the marketplace — and how this new technology might quicken the pace. Indeed, Sprando's colleague, senior advisor for toxicology Suzanne Fitzpatrick, summed it up in her FDA blog post written the day the agreement with Emulate was announced: ""In some ways, science is like a recipe, in that both can go through a number of incarnations before they work. There's a lot of experimenting and tweaking, collaborating and comparing. And that's what we'll be doing at FDA with the organs-on-chips research. We're excited to be at the forefront of this groundbreaking research, which may one day be routinely used to safeguard public health.""

519,Andrew Ross Sorkin,8172017,CNBC,8102017,"At what point do the C.E.O.s of the largest companies in the United States tell President Trump that enough is enough? Not yet, apparently. On Monday morning, President Trump went on a tirade on against Kenneth C. Frazier, chief executive of Merck, the pharmaceuticals giant. Mr. Frazier, one of the nation's most prominent African-American chief executives, had announced through his company's Twitter account that he was resigning from the president's American Manufacturing Council in response to Mr. Trump's refusal over the weekend to immediately and directly condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis carrying swastika flags in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Trump had blamed the bigotry and violence — which left one anti-bigotry protester dead — ""on all sides."" More from New York Times:Is China outsmarting America in A.I.?  Uncle Sam wants your deep neural networks'Machines of loving grace,' by John Markoff ""America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,"" Mr. Frazier said. @merck Within minutes on Monday, Mr. Trump, in far less time that it took him to react to the violence in Charlottesville, was on Twitter criticizing Mr. Frazier. @realDonaldTrump: Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! The silence from the larger C.E.O. community about Mr. Trump's reaction to the situation in Charlottesville has been remarkably conspicuous, even as one of their own has now been attacked online by the president. A few big-name corporate leaders released innocuous statements over the weekend condemning the violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. But with the exception of Mr. Frazier, none appear to have directly condemned the president's choice of words, which have been a lightning rod for Americans from many quarters, even among many Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters. (The president said at a news conference on Monday, after a barrage of blistering criticism, that ""racism is evil."") The closest thing to a critique of Mr. Trump's language from a United States C.E.O. came from Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who tweeted on Monday morning: @lloydblankfein: Lincoln: ""A house divided against itself cannot stand."" Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together. (Mr. Blankfein is not on any of the president's councils, which may make it easier for him to be critical.) But how can so many other American business leaders and senior executives remain quiet about the president's reaction? Where is the moral courage to stand up? After all, most companies these days spend countless hours talking about their culture and values. Just last week, Google publicly fired one of its engineers within days of his writing a memo that questioned whether ""personality differences"" between men and women led to there being fewer women engineers in the technology industry. How can people like  Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a lead director of Goldman Sachs and an infrastructure investor, remain a member of Mr. Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum — a role highlighted on Mr. Ogunlesi's company biography? How could Mr. Ogunlesi, an immigrant from Nigeria who was a clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court, not say anything? As Justice Marshall himself famously said, ""Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy."" Mr. Ogunlesi declined to comment, through a representative. What about Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo? She is a member the president's business council and has long been a vocal advocate for minorities. The company said this year that it ""does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form."" When I contacted her about Mr. Trump's remarks over the weekend, a spokesman directed me to a tweet that clearly didn't mention the president: @IndraNooyi: Heartbroken by the violence in #
Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans. Some people who have less at stake are going on record to support Mr. Frazier's stance against the president. Tom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, wrote on Twitter on Monday: ""Ken has stood up for true American values. I call on all other members of Trump's image-burnishing committees to do the same."" Privately, many chief executives say they are fuming, outraged by the president. (This after many of them campaigned to get on Mr. Trump's committees.) But many are too scared to say anything publicly that could make them or their company a target of Mr. Trump's wrath. Indeed, Mr. Trump's vitriol against Mr. Frazier and Merck — a company that depends on the government as a buyer for many of its drugs — will perhaps have an even greater chilling effect on other C.E.O.s who may consider speaking out. (The potential for economic retribution against Merck also demonstrates just how brave Mr. Frazier was in taking a stand.) When I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: ""Just look at what he did to Ken. I'm not sticking my head up."" Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name. The same trepidation may explain why people like Mr. Ogunlesi don't say anything. He runs an infrastructure fund that will most likely have to do business with the federal government. And Ms. Nooyi's PepsiCo, for example, was briefly boycotted by Trump supporters when she made some comments that were construed as critical of him. Other C.E.O.s, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, have contended that they consider it part of their patriotic duty to remain on the president's business council, even when they disagree with things Mr. Trump says or does. ""It is very hard if you say, I'm going to go off an advisory group or not do a,b,c, because you disagree on one issue,"" Mr. Dimon said in early June after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, a move that Mr. Dimon was against. Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert Iger of Disney resigned from the council in protest. ""Honestly, no one is going to agree with every president or prime minister on every issue, so I don't want to overreact to it,"" Mr. Dimon said. Lawrence Summers, who has served as Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard University, said in response to Mr. Dimon's rationale at the time to Bloomberg News: ""At what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country rather to your president? I've always thought of my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country."" A fair critique of the president is that he didn't immediately and directly condemn the bigoted actions over the weekend and call them out for what they were — remarks that tacitly helped normalize such hate. While C.E.O.s may call out the hate, will they have the fortitude to call out the president? ",Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier left White House. What about the other CEOs,-0.9886

Insurance stocks can be an excellent investment for both growth and income. While there are many dividend-paying stocks in the insurance industry, here are three -- a health insurer, a life insurer, and a specialty insurer -- that could be excellent long-term investments in your portfolio. Company Stock Symbol Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Aetna AET $155.70 1.3% MetLife MET $48.12 3.3% Aflac AFL $81.32 2.1% Data source: TD Ameritrade. Stock prices and yields as of 8/9/17. Aetna (NYSE:AET) is a leader in the health insurance business, offering HMO, POS, and PPO products, as well as Medicare Advantage, Part D prescription drug coverage, and Medicare Supplemental plans. The company has done a fantastic job of growing, with revenue up by 84% since 2010. Image source: Getty Images. As far as Aetna's dividend goes, you'll notice that it's the smallest yield on the list, by a wide margin. For starters, the current dividend represents a payout ratio of just 21% of 2017's expected earnings, which leaves plenty of room for growth. In addition, Aetna has a $4 billion buyback authorization in effect, which represents nearly 8% of the company's outstanding shares. And finally, in addition to providing a steady stream of income, Aetna has been a phenomenal total return investment. Since 2000, Aetna has returned a staggering 2,370%, which translates to a 20% annualized return over the past 17.5 years. MetLife (NYSE:MET) recently completed its spinoff of Brighthouse Financial, which should allow the company to focus on its core businesses of group life insurance, employee benefits, international operations, and asset management. Between these categories, MetLife serves about 100 million customers and has operations in almost 50 countries around the world. MetLife is the largest U.S. life insurer, and it has one of the strongest brand names in the entire insurance industry. Furthermore, the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from job and wage growth in the United States, as this could generate rising group life insurance sales. One potential caveat -- although MetLife pays the most generous dividend yield of the three stocks discussed here, there could be a dividend reduction in store for MetLife, but not for a bad reason. 21% of last year's profits came from Brighthouse, and this may need to be compensated for now that the spinoff is complete. I'm not necessarily saying it will happen, but I wouldn't be surprised. With a dividend yield of 2.1%, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) isn't exactly a ""high dividend"" stock, but there are other reasons to love this specialized insurance company. For starters, Aflac is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its payout annually for more than 30 years, and with a payout ratio of just 26% of TTM earnings, there's no reason to believe the streak will end anytime soon. Aflac is a unique insurer, providing coverage for situations that most traditional insurance plans don't cover. Major products include accident insurance, short-term disability insurance, and critical illness insurance. In addition, it often surprises people not too familiar with the company to learn that the majority of Aflac's revenue comes from Japan. In a nutshell, an aging population in both of its major markets and the ongoing potential for healthcare reform in the U.S. should give Aflac opportunities to provide innovative insurance solutions going forward.

521,Motley Fool Staff,8172017,Fool,8102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The marijuana industry is quite large in the U.S. today, and it might be on track to grow at an exponential rate -- but the key word there is ""might."" Marijuana producers and dispensaries face an incredible amount of risk from multiple angles. A full transcript follows the video. Kristine Harjes: Our first stock is not about the Gold Rush, but rather what I have heard referred to as the Green Rush, and this is the expansion of the marijuana industry. Todd Campbell: Green gold, if you will. As you know, Kristine, I write a little bit on the subject, with some of the other Fool authors, trying to help people steer in the right direction. One of the things that invariably comes up when I'm talking to investors is the question, how big could this market really be? Everyone wants to think, what is the size of this opportunity? And the answer that I always give is big, but we don't know how big, because there's so much that's going to go into determining how much money can be made in producing and marketing and selling recreational or medical marijuana. By estimates -- and those are the only things we can use at this point -- we're talking about a market that could throw to $25 billion by 2021. And that's a huge jump from where we are today. Harjes: Right. This is an industry that is growing at an incredible clip. Legal weed sales grew by 34% in North America to almost $7 billion in 2016. As you mentioned, they're on track to continue growing at this kind of double-digit rate. The cannabis research firm ArcView predicts that weed sales will grow at a compound annual rate of 26% through 2021, which gets you to that $22 billion in five years. I also saw that investment firm Cowen & Co (NASDAQ:COWN) called for $50 billion in legal cannabis sales in the United States by 2026. As you mentioned, it's pretty tough to put such a precise number on this, given that there's so much regulatory uncertainty. But as of right now, 29 states have legalized medical cannabis, and residents in another eight states have said yes to having recreational weed also be legal. So, right now, you have a humongous black market in both these legal states and also all the states where it's not legal, and it's very difficult to put numbers on how much of that a legal market would eventually be able to take. But any way you slice it, this is a gigantic opportunity. Campbell: Right. I think one of the biggest drivers of growth over the course of the next few years is going to be the passage of recreational marijuana laws last November in California, which is already the hugest market for medical marijuana, with its Emerald Triangle being one of the largest producing regions in the world of marijuana. There are already a thousand medical marijuana dispensaries operating in California, and theoretically, depending on how quickly the switch gets flipped to recreational, those could be up and running relatively quickly and providing a fairly quick ramp up for market sales. You mentioned the Cowen & Company prediction, which is just an eye-popping number, $50 billion by 2026. But, that comes with a huge caveat, and that caveat is, if recreational is legalized nationally on the federal level. Because, I think one of the things that a lot of people fail to understand is, yes, individual states are going ahead and legalizing either medical or recreational marijuana, but marijuana still remains illegal on a federal level. Harjes: Right, and that raises some interesting challenges for the businesses that are operating in this space. Marijuana stocks have been on an absolute tear because of the hype around this industry. You hear these projections and it's hard to not get excited about, ""OK, let me get in on the ground quickly, and I'm going to make millions in this."" But if you actually look at the businesses themselves, they face some inherent disadvantages. For example, because marijuana is illegal at the federal level, these businesses can't take your normal corporate income tax deductions. Meanwhile, they also have pretty limited access to basic banking services like a checking account, because a lot of the financial services don't want to have this association to businesses that are technically not doing legal business at the federal level. Campbell: Yeah. You create all sorts of risks there in the banking systems, as far as transferring money across state lines and all sorts of things. So, yes, you're talking about kind of a wild wild west rush, green rush, that we're seeing here. You have the regulatory concern. And not only is it still illegal on a federal level -- I think this is the other thing that's important for investors to recognize -- but, under President Obama, the decision was made not to get mixed up at the state level. The state said it was OK, they weren't going to enforce federally in those states. That could change under President Trump, because his attorney general is a guy named Jeff Sessions, who's been a pretty big vocal opponent to the legalization of marijuana. So, there's a lot of legislative risk and enforcement risk for these stocks. It's also still a Schedule I drug. Marijuana is still a Schedule I drug. That creates some additional risks and concerns that could limit the use of it medically, or its expansion into other states. Then, from an individual stock-picking level, there's this whole other component of, what stock do I pick? Because most of these stocks are fly by-night companies. They're started, and their shares go out on the over-the-counter market or the pink sheets. They're very high risk companies that aren't held to the same level of scrutiny for listing requirements as, say, the larger companies that are on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. So, if you go out and you're buying these stocks, you're theoretically exposing yourself not only to the risk of picking the wrong stock, but of picking the wrong stock and having it be a fraudulent company.

Chinese companies present a potentially huge opportunity for investors, but the market in China carries unique risks and challenges that bear consideration. Here is how to invest in shares of Chinese companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available for trading in the U.S. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in China can be a real trick as companies there carry various share classes that may or may not be accessible to the average investor outside China. For example, A shares are shares of a Chinese company that are only available to investors in mainland China. H shares, on the other hand, are shares of those companies that trade in Hong Kong and are available to anyone -- assuming your broker allows you to trade on the Hong Kong exchange. The easiest way to invest in Chinese companies, though, is to buy shares that list on an exchange here in the United States. Here is a list of the largest Chinese companies available with market capitalizations over $10 billion: Company Market Cap TTM Price-to-Earnings What the Company Does Alibaba $389 billion 61.5 China's largest e-commerce network PetroChina $205 billion 29.9 An integrated oil and energy company China Life Insurance $106 billion 29.9 A life, health, and accident insurance company operating in mainland China China Petroleum & Chemical $94 billion 11.0 An integrated oil and energy company Baidu $77 billion 48.9 China's largest internet search engine JD.com $61 billion (154.1) A leading Chinese e-commerce platform NetEase $41 billion 21.3 A leading online multimedia and services provider China Telecom $36 billion 19.1 Wireline and mobile telecom services provider Ctrip.com $27 billion 760.6 Travel and accommodation booking website Weibo $19 billion 130.5 A Chinese social network and video gaming platform Huaneng Power $12 billion 15.0 A leading utility company Yum China Holdings $14 billion 27.2 KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell in China and the largest restaurant chain New Oriental Education & Technology $13 billion 49.6 A private education services provider China Eastern Airlines $13 billion 11.0 Airline and transportation services Aluminum Corporation of China $12 billion 98.2 Chinese manufacturer of aluminum products China Southern Airlines $11 billion 12.7 Airline and transportation services ZTO Express $10 billion 29.9 Delivery and logistics provider in China Data sources: Yahoo! Finance. TTM = trailing 12 months. In addition, some companies, such as China's largest social network owner, Tencent Holdings, are available on over-the-counter markets. In all, some 300 Chinese companies can be traded in some way stateside. The work in filtering through those can be difficult, but an easier option also exists. There are dozens of Chinese ETFs that have popped up over the years, covering everything from debt to specific industries operating in mainland China. If you're looking for broad exposure to the Chinese stock market, though, here is the list you should start with: Fund Fund Total Net Assets Expense Ratio Fund Composition iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) $2.58 billion 0.61% The fund holds shares of Chinese companies that are available to all international investors. PowerShares Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ) $186 million 0.70% The fund is composed of Chinese companies whose shares are listed on a U.S. exchange. DB X-Trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (NYSEMKT:ASHR) $487 million 0.65% The fund holds A shares of the largest 300 Chinese companies that only trade on a Chinese exchange. Data sources: iShares, PowerShares, and Deutsche Bank. When investing in Chinese stock ETFs, investors have three basic choices: stocks listed on Chinese stock exchanges, international investor shares, and companies specifically listed on U.S. exchanges. The DB X-Trackers fund, which holds Chinese exchange-listed companies, has had the wildest performance due to the bubble-and-bust China market of 2015. Because of the extra risk involved, owning shares in China's fast-developing and changing mainland economy may not be the best route to take for the faint of heart. Data by YCharts. Of the two funds that own shares of companies listed outside of the Chinese stock exchanges -- iShares MSCI China ETF and PowerShares Golden Dragon China ETF -- PowerShares Golden Dragon and the companies it owns listed in the U.S. have fared better. Some, but not all, of that has to do with the extra risk with fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Listing on major U.S. exchanges has also helped moderate the roller-coaster movements that investing in an emerging economy can present. For investors who want to bet on the future of the Chinese economy, there are plenty of options. There are more individual companies than ever available for trading for those of you who don't mind the homework, and a myriad of ETFs can help you get broad exposure to the whole market. Whichever option you go with, be prepared for a roller-coaster ride as China's economy continues to modernize. ","

After a complaint was filed in federal court alleging that Dunkin' Brands' (NASDAQ:DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts' steak sandwiches do not actually contain ""steak,"" a new suit makes similar charges about its blueberry bakery items. The lawsuit, which was filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, was filed by attorneys for Bartosz Grabowski ""and on behalf of all others similarly situated."" It seeks class action status. The plaintiff claims that the coffee chain's various blueberry-named bakery products, including Glazed Blueberry doughnuts, Blueberry Butternut doughnuts, and Blueberry Crumb Cake doughnuts, contain imitation blueberries ""that highly resemble actual blueberries due to their round shape and blue color."" Lawyers claim that if their client had known the products did not contain blueberries, he either would not have purchased them or would have paid significantly less for the products. They seek in excess of $5 million to remedy the situation. Dunkin' Donuts does not list blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry doughnuts. Image source: Getty Images. While Dunkin' Donuts lists blueberries as an ingredient in its blueberry muffins, none of its blueberry doughnuts list the fruit as an ingredient. The company's various ""blueberry"" doughnut flavors appear to use a mix of non-fruit ingredients to simulate blueberries in the baked treats. The lawsuit charges that this is an attempt to deceive consumers. Through its manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the Blueberry Products, Defendant has represented that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. Defendant has named the Blueberry Products as ""Blueberry Butternut"", ""Blueberry Crumb Cake"", and ""Glazed Blueberry"", indicating that the Blueberry Products contain actual blueberries. The lawsuit contends that blueberries have health benefits that consumers would be willing to pay more for. It also notes that when buying a doughnut in-store, consumers see the blueberry doughnuts displayed alongside other products, including various doughnuts and muffins, that contain the fruit they are named for. Food lawsuits have become common in recent years with Subway being sued over its sandwiches not being the size advertised while Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has been sued multiple times over whether it fills its drinks properly. While Starbucks has either won its cases or seen them dismissed, Subway did have to pay up to $525,000 in attorneys fees, and take steps to ensure its 12-inch sandwiches actually measure 12 inches. In the case of the Dunkin' suit, the case is a little different because it involves whether it's OK to call a product ""blueberry"" when it contains no blueberries. There is some precedent for this as certain beverage products marketed using fruit names do list how much (or how little) actual juice they contain. If this case proceeds, it's possible that Dunkin' may have to change its marketing for these products. Given the past history of lawsuits like this, it's somewhat unlikely the plaintiffs will receive a large cash payout. That's because while the lawsuit makes a case for the benefits of the fruit, noting that ""blueberries have the potential to limit the development and severity of certain cancers and vascular diseases,"" it's highly unlikely anyone specifically seeking those health benefits does so through doughnuts.

Because, again, you hit on, we talk a lot about companies like Celgene, one of my favorite stocks out there. But Regeneron is a very interesting stock. It's a little bit smaller than those three upper echelon players -- Gilead, Amgen, and Celgene. It has a $50 billion market cap instead of $100 billion market cap. But there are reasons to think this company could take that next step higher and become part of that commonly discussed group on this show and elsewhere. I thought it would be a lot of fun to dive in and talk about the different things that are going on at the company, because there's a tremendous amount of research and development activity going on at the company. Again, it's a big company. This is a substantial, investable idea that we can talk to our listeners about. They have 5,400 employees, a $50 billion market cap. They did almost $5 billion in revenue last year. They're profitable, and they make a lot of money. So I'm looking forward to it. Harjes: Yeah, this is definitely not one of your tiny pre-clinical stocks that we sometimes talk about on this show, but rather an established player that is clawing its way up to be at the top of the hill of biotechs. This is a company that, for a long, long time, was known for just one drug called Eylea. This is their flagship product, which was first approved in 2011 for various retinal diseases. They're just recently, within the past few years or so, starting to branch out and diversify into other drugs. They now have a handful of approved drugs and an incredibly deep pipeline. But let's start at the beginning and talk a little bit about Eylea. Campbell: Kristine, I think one of the listeners' favorite shows based on responses that we got in the past has been the catching-lightning-in-a-bottle type shows, where we've highlighted CEOs that have successfully developed drugs and then sold their companies and are now trying to do it again. I think we should really give a shout out to two proven leaders, CEOs at companies that don't leave and start over, but still catch lightning in a bottle over and over and over again at the companies that they stay at. And one of those leaders is Regeneron's CEO, Leonard Schleifer, who has proven that he's developed a very good model for discovering, developing, and now winning FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval of drugs across a few different indications. You mentioned Eylea being the No. 1 drug, the most important drug right now for the company, in terms of revenue and everything else. But they've actually had six different drugs that they've found internally that have made it through the FDA gauntlet and have made it to market -- four of those being significant drugs, which I define as drugs that either already have $1 billion in sales, Eylea, or could end up having $1 billion in sales, which would be these three more recently discovered drugs: Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara. Harjes: Yes. Looking at these drugs, as you mentioned, a lot of them do have the potential to eventually hit that blockbuster status. But I think it's also important to look at Eylea and its own growth, because this is a pretty established drug that has been bringing in a lot of revenue for Regeneron for quite a while, but it's still growing fairly quickly. Sales in the U.S. were up 11% year over year. Regeneron just reported its earnings on August 3 -- we're talking about the second quarter here. In that quarter, it sold nearly a billion, just in the quarter alone. This is at nearly a $4 billion run rate just with U.S. sales. It's important to note that Regeneron receives just a share of profit from ex-U.S. sales because it's partnered with Bayer on this drug. Campbell: Right. Bayer and Regeneron are working together on commercializing the drug globally. This is a monster drug in a huge indication. I think you mentioned briefly that it's approved to treat wet stage age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. These are two increasingly common causes of vision loss within older patients. If you think about this for a second, what's the argument for the growth that you're referencing? You've got 76 million baby boomers, and they're turning 65 at a pace of 10,000 people per day. The incidence of these two indications within this patient population, as they're getting older and living longer, is increasing. What's really intriguing about Eylea and its success, this is a drug that did $1.5 billion in global sales last quarter alone. So, it has a $6 billion global run rate. That growth has come not because of price increases, but because it's being more increasingly used -- more patients are being diagnosed with these conditions, and then some market-share wins. There's other players. We'll talk about the competition, because I think that's important, too. I think this is an important drug. It's likely to remain an important drug for the company, especially given the fact that they have patent protection on the drug that stretches out into the 2020s. Harjes: Right. When you look at the indications that it is approved for, you can see the demographic trends hidden in the name of the diseases. You have wet age-related macular degeneration, wet AMD, it's age related. As you mentioned, that's a huge growing population. Its other approved indication is diabetic macular edema. This is a diabetic condition, and the population of diabetics is also something that is growing. It's also approved for diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. You can see exactly why this drug will continue to grow. You mentioned that it does have some competition. It's competing with a drug called Lucentis. There could potentially be some biosimilars to Lucentis, which are copycat versions of it that could be a little bit cheaper once the Lucentis patent expires in 2020. There's also an interesting competition going on between Lucentis and Eylea and Roche's drug called Avastin, which is a cancer drug that's being used off-label in this indication because it's so much cheaper. Campbell: Yeah, it's way cheaper, and as a result, its market share is, I want to say it's 30%-40% in wet AMD. Harjes: It's interesting. For me, it's one of the most high-profile times that we see an off-label drug being used across an indication with any sort of huge reach. Harjes: Yeah. This is a company that recognizes it has a really strong foothold in retinal diseases. It knows how important Eylea is to it, but it also knows that it needs to diversify. It reminds me of a lot of other companies in this regard. For example, let's compare it to Gilead Sciences. This would be like Gilead Sciences saying, ""We know HIV is super important. That's been the foundation of our business,"" and I'm talking a couple years ago now. At that point, they said, ""We need to do something other than HIV, as well, to continue having new growth drivers."" And still today, you see Gilead branching out into new indications and trying to find that next step, what's going to drive future growth. Campbell: Yeah. Similar to Celgene, right Kristine? You talk about Revlimid, $8 billion in sales from Revlimid, and they're spreading out into some other indications, too. You're right, it's very important for these companies to be expanding. And Regeneron is doing it. Harjes: Yeah, it's a story that you see a lot. When you think about the life cycle of biotechs, they often do strike it big with one indication or one drug, and then they're established and they have cash flow coming in and they need to use it to fund clinical development to keep that growth moving and keep investors satisfied. We've talked a whole ton about Eylea, and don't get me wrong, that's a very important component of Regeneron. But we think it's even more exciting to discuss what else Regeneron has going on, both in its product portfolio and in its pipeline. Campbell: There are so many moving pieces to this company since 2015. It's really important for investors who are interested in buying Regeneron to understand both the positives, what the market opportunity could be for its newest drugs, but also some of the risks and the challenges that are facing these drugs. I think a great place to start, Kristine, would be to look at Praluent, which is the first of the three most recently launched drugs. That won approval in summer of 2015 for use in treating bad cholesterol -- high bad cholesterol -- in patients in which it was genetically caused. A pretty tough-to-treat indication. That drug launched with these multi-billion-dollar blockbuster expectations, but it's been a little bit disappointing. It's still selling pretty well, but it's nowhere near what those expectations were. Harjes: Right. Praluent is what's known as a PCSK9 inhibitor. We've talked about them on the show before. It's a drug that works to lower your cholesterol levels in a novel way. When you consider how many Americans take drugs for cholesterol levels, you would think this would be a huge success. The problem is, it's pretty expensive. This drug is $14,000 a year. You compare that to drugs like statins, which are not under patent protection anymore, the generics are pretty darn cheap, especially compared to $14,000 annually. So this drug is really not doing as great as people were expecting. It saw sales of just $46 million in the past quarter, and that was up from $26 million from the quarter of a year ago, so Q2 2016. But still, these numbers are really tiny for a drug that was supposed to be a billion-dollar blockbuster. Campbell: Yeah. I think a lot of investors were disappointed by that. That's one of the reasons why Regeneron shares underperformed in 2016. But I think they're looking forward now and they're saying, Praluent sales are up pretty substantial year over year. We're now at about a $200 million a year run rate. That's solid. And there is a big Phase III study that's wrapping up at the end of this year. With data coming out early 2018, they could move the needle and make this drug more commonly used, too, and that's an outcome study that's evaluating whether or not using Praluent actually reduces the likelihood of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes. Harjes: Which, that data is pretty darn important if you are a payer looking at whether or not a $14,000 price tag is worth it. You might want to know, is this actually going to lower the risk of a cardiovascular event? So there's 18,000 patients in this study, and we should be getting data in early 2018. That could swing things in a positive direction for this company. Let's also look at one big threat to this drug and to Regeneron -- which is the ongoing legal battle that they have with Amgen and its competing drug, Repatha. Campbell: [Dun-dun-dun.] It's not all roses and fairy tales over here. We do have a big risk, a big challenge that investors have to be aware of when it comes to this drug. And that's that Amgen has sued Regeneron and Sanofi, its partner on the drug, for patent infringement. So far, the courts have been siding with Amgen on it. As a matter of fact, previously, the courts actually said that Sanofi and Regeneron would have to stop selling Praluent in the United States. That was stayed pending appeal, which is why you're still seeing this drug on the market racking up revenue. But depending on how this all shakes out, you could run all sorts of different scenarios. You could say, Amgen ends up winning in the appeal, and as a result, Praluent disappears from the marketplace along with its $200 million in annualized sales. You could say, Amgen wins, and they cut a deal to share royalty streams somehow with Praluent sales. Or you could say, Regeneron comes out on top and Praluent continues as is, the outcome study comes out aces, and the next thing you know, you have a billion-dollar blockbuster on your hands. Harjes: Right. As with many legal matters, outcome hazy, we'll see what happens with that. But what you need to take away from this is that Praluent has, thus far at least, not lived up to the hype. But fortunately, that was not the only drug that Regeneron was developing to diversify away from Eylea. It was able to launch a drug recently called Dupixent, which is now approved for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Campbell: This is a really intriguing drug, and it may even have a bigger commercial opportunity than Praluent does. Moderate-to-severe eczema is very difficult to treat. There's not a lot of treatment options out there. The drug costs $37,000 annually, which sounds like a lot of money, but it's actually not that bad. The payers and insurers basically applauded that price tag when it was announced. The market for Dupixent could be multiple billions of dollars in a year, taken with a grain of salt because we know, as we've seen in the past, peak sales estimates oftentimes fall short. But I have seen people out there saying that if other studies that are evaluating Dupixent in asthma, for example, results coming soon, stay tuned, potential approval application getting filed by the end of this year. You could see this drug generate about $4 billion in annual sales by 2023. Now, I think that's a stretch. But I think what you can look at this drug and say, with its current indication, and with the potential in asthma, and the potential to be used in more patients over time, this absolutely could be a significant driver of sales. And Sanofi and Regeneron will split any profit on it. Harjes: Despite the little bit of skepticism there is about whether or not this drug will be able to outperform drugs like Novartis' Cosentyx, there's also competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline, it's definitely not a market that they have to themselves. This kind of has become the favorite child after Praluent was so disappointing. So, lots of excitement going on around this drug, particularly seeing how it launches in its currently approved indications, as well as how it performs in some of the currently ongoing trials that you mentioned, Todd. Campbell: Kristine, just to interject before we jump to the next one, Q2 sales of the drug, first quarter on the market, $28 million. So better than a $100 million run rate right out of the gate. Harjes: Yeah, that's not bad. It's pretty hard to project future sales based on the first quarter on the market, but that's definitely a good sign that payers are accepting the price tag and doctors are prescribing the drug. Off to a good start, and definitely something to keep an eye on. Oh, one more detail before we move on to the next drug: Amgen is also battling over this patent. Which is kind of interesting, because Amgen doesn't even have a rival drug here. They don't even have something in the pipeline, which also means that they can't ask for an injunction that would pull the drug from the market. Amgen is just looking for money here. It's like they're a consistent thorn in the side of Regeneron. Anyway, moving on to the next drug that we wanted to highlight, this one is called Kevzara, and it treats moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, which is another enormous indication. Campbell: Yeah, a multi-billion-dollar indication with a lot of players, dominated by anti-TNF drugs like Humira, which listeners will probably remember. Humira is the biggest-selling drug on the planet, with about $16 billion in annual sales. Kevzara is not going to be that big. It's going to be more of a niche player, because its approval is for use in patients who have tried and failed on other therapies like DMARDs and Humira and the like. However, a $39,000 annual price tag is cheaper than Humira, and that has some people thinking that Kevzara could win away sales in this indication. Again, grain-of-salt warning. Peak sales estimates could be $1 billion for the drug over time. We'll have to see, though, because again, this is a competitive marketplace, and I'm not entirely sure just how much of this market they'll end up winning. Harjes: One key question to keep an eye out for is whether doctors will eventually be able to, or want to, prescribe this as a first-line treatment. For context, they actually did test this against Humira in trials and showed that the two had similar safety. That should be really important in making the case to prescribing doctors that you might want to just try Kevzara right away. But for now, that's not going to be the case. Humira is extremely well established. There are plenty of other drugs that are established in the space. I think you're right that, for now, it will be a niche, later-line drug. Campbell: Yeah. I think you watch it over the course of the next few quarters, you see what the prescription trends look like in the quarterly reports. All of these companies, as listeners should know, they talk about their performance every quarter, you can see the transcripts online, you can go through and read them after they have their discussions. Oftentimes, they'll talk about market share, they'll talk about prescription trends, they'll talk about how these drugs are doing. I think if you evaluate this one over the course of the next three or four quarters, you'll get a feel for whether or not this is going to be a drug that does $200 million a year in sales, or potentially could do much more than that. But it's still going to be a fairly substantial drug, because think about it -- when you start poo-pooing drugs that may only do nine figures in sales, you know you're talking about a pretty strong company. Harjes: Yeah, exactly. But that's not all. They also have a humongous pipeline. We just walked you through the product portfolio -- things that are approved. But the pipeline also has 17 more product candidates in it. Five of them are in Phase III trials. Some of these are label extensions for the drugs we just talked about. For example, Todd, you mentioned earlier extending the label of Eylea. I think you also mentioned Dupixent in asthma that's going on. They're also looking at Praluent in hypercholesterolemia, so expanding that indication to a wider set of people. But they also have completely novel candidates that they're studying. There's one drug called Fasinumab, and they're studying that in osteoarthritis pain, as well as chronic lower back pain. They have a PD-1 drug, which is something we talk a little bit about on this show, and that one is called REGN2810. Campbell: Kristine, just to interrupt for a second, I think that one might be the one that investors really want to focus on in the pipeline. Harjes: Yeah, because it could be huge. These PD-1 drugs are absolutely enormous in their scope. Currently, the 2810 drug is being studied in Phase III in non-small cell lung cancer. They initiate it in the second quarter. They also have a potentially pivotal Phase II study in basal cell carcinoma that was indicated in the quarter. Because of the mechanism of action, it could absolutely be possible for this drug to treat a variety of different cancers, and could seriously rack up some sales there. Campbell: Yeah, we talked about Opdivo and Keytruda a lot on the show. Those are the two top-selling PD-1 drugs. They have combined sales of over $2 billion per quarter right now. Obviously, this is a huge market that could be targeted. What companies like Regeneron are doing, they're a little bit late to the dance, they're looking for indications that are under-treated where they can get fast-track and early-accelerated approval, so they can play a little bit of catch-up. So they're smaller indications, but they can get to the market quicker, and then they can file for supplemental approvals after that on a little bit more of an expedited time frame so they start to generate some sales. I think the thing to watch here is data from their trial in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common cause of skin cancer. Data from a pivotal Phase II trial is expected in that soon. If that's good, they think they can file for approval within the next 12 months. So theoretically, depending on if they get fast-tracked or not, you could have this PD-1 drug hitting the market in, we'll call it 18 months. Harjes: Yeah, when you look at Regeneron's most recent quarterly earnings statement, the press release has this grid on it, and its upcoming catalysts. I believe, if I'm recalling it correctly, it's just for the remainder of the year. And it's packed. There are so many things in this list. If you extend that one year out, it's just incredible how many different pivotal trials will have data, or potential approvals, or filing for FDA approval. This company really has a lot going on for it. One thing that I want to highlight before we sign off, because we haven't talked about this very much, is the collaboration that they have with Sanofi. Sanofi is a partner on almost all of the drugs that we talked about. They have a huge, long-standing relationship. There's also the Bayer partnership on Eylea. So this is a company that plays well with others, and it's been very profitable so far to pursue this kind of partnership strategy. Campbell: Right. But Sanofi's walking away from this partnership, at least in the antibody development, at the end of this year. People will have to take a look and see what that means. Regeneron will end up getting reimbursed less money for research and development next year from Sanofi. I don't think that's going to be a substantial number, but it could be a number that put a little bit of headwinds on sales growth for some of the smaller drugs like Kevzara. If you lose $30 to $40 million in development revenue per quarter, that could have an impact. So you have to watch and see how that plays out. Sanofi is going to continue to work on the existing drugs with Regeneron, and they do still have a separate pact in immuno-oncology. Again, we were just talking about the PD-1 drug -- that's a Sanofi-shared drug, as well. They're going to continue to develop that together, as well. I think overall, Kristine, this is a financially stable, fast-growing company. Their earnings are growing quicker than Celgene's, for example, year over year. They have a lot going on. I think it's worth having on people's radar. Harjes: Yeah. I think that the Sanofi collaboration is ending come December, is a little bit of a sign of maturity with this company. When you're an early stage company, it's a lot more important that you have a big brother of sorts handing you money to develop your early-stage candidates, get them through all the clinical-trial processes, which are very expensive. But then you have drugs on the market, and you're kicking off your own free cash flow. So that's kind of the place where Regeneron is right now, and it's actually at a point where it can be the big brother, or the big sister, itself. For example, they have an agreement with a smaller company called Intellia Therapeutics, and they're working with them on some CRISPR research. It's very early stage, as with everything CRISPR. But Regeneron is now responsible for shouldering the development costs for Intellia, and it'll pay Intellia some milestones, it'll pay royalties on future sales. But because this company has gotten to be of a size where it has financial weight, it has money at its disposal to do things. The balance sheet is incredibly strong. They have well over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, no long-term debt. They have another $1 billion in long-term investments. This is a company that's really come into its own and deserves to be talked about in this upper echelon of biotech stocks. Campbell: Yeah, it's not a cheap stock though, Kristine. That's the final takeaway for investors, too. It's a great growth story, but you're paying up a little bit for that growth. Harjes: Yeah, absolutely. Do you want to share some of the ratios? Campbell: Forward P/E of this stock is 29. If you compare that to Celgene, Celgene's forward P/E is 15. It's P/E-to-growth ratio is 1.74. If you look at the P/E-to-growth of Celgene, it's 0.82. It's trading at 9.5 times sales, Celgene's trading at 8.4 times sales. So it's a little bit of an expensive company. Again, those ratios are reflecting what we've done so far, not necessarily what we may do going forward. So bear that in mind, as well. As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. This show is produced by Austin Morgan. For Todd Campbell, I'm Kristine Harjes, thanks for listening and Fool on! ","

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has maintained near-term support. Specifically, the index has notched consecutive session lows just above the 21,840 floor, detailed last week. Conversely, near-term overhead closely matches the 22,000 mark, and a retest is underway. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq has rallied respectably from one-month lows. In the process, it’s reached familiar resistance — the 6,342-to-6,344 inflection point — an area also illustrated below. The Nasdaq closed Monday at 6,340, and the retest remains underway. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed to the 6,342 resistance from one-month lows. To reiterate, Monday’s close registered just two points lower. Separately, the Nasdaq’s primary uptrend has apparently absorbed its latest whipsaw under the 50-day moving average, currently 6,273. The prevailing series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” signals an uptrend. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark’s backdrop remains the strongest. As illustrated, the August downturn has been underpinned by 21,840 support — illustrated on the hourly chart — an area closely matching the 20-day moving average. The 20-day moving average is a widely-tracked near-term trending indicator, and the Dow’s sustained summer posture higher signals a strong uptrend. Similarly, the S&P 500’s bull trend has absorbed the August downdraft. Tactically, an inflection point spans from 2,449 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average (in blue) and the June peak. To reiterate, the S&P’s nearly immediate reversal to the former range is technically constructive. Though the bigger-picture technicals remain bullish, the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has staged a garden-variety pullback, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have thus far weathered more aggressive August downturns.

                                   has narrowly maintained the 200-day moving average, currently 136.46. Last week’s close (136.47) registered fractionally higher, and the small-cap benchmark has extended its rally attempt this week. Tactically, resistance matches the breakdown point (138.85), detailed previously, and a retest is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has bottomed slightly atop the 200-day moving average, and rallied from two-month lows. Consider that the 200-day moving average is in play partly as a product of the mid-cap benchmark’s prolonged eight-month range. The sideways price action moves the average price of the prior 200 days closer to the current price. Still, the 200-day is a widely-tracked primary trending indicator, and the quality of the prevailing rally attempt is worth tracking. An eventual violation would likely raise a technical caution flag.

                                    remains comparably stronger. Familiar levels stand out: The SPY has reversed firmly atop resistance, preserving a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. Collectively, technical divergences have surfaced this month. The prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. The small- and mid-cap benchmarks remain comparably softer, though each has maintained the 200-day moving average, rising from two-month lows. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ pullback has been garden-variety, while the Nasdaq Composite’s bull trend trend has likely absorbed a respectable August downdraft. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. The nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 area — closely matching the 50-day moving average and the June peak — places the index on firmer technical ground. This area remains an inflection point, though the S&P 500’s intermediate-term bias remains bullish pending a more technically damaging downturn.

To start, the shares have asserted a range-bound, or trendless, six-month backdrop. The flatlining major moving averages bisect the range, exemplifying the absence of trend. Still, the shares have challenged the range top, and the retest is worth tracking. Major resistance is frequently cleared on the third of fourth test. More broadly, the shares have cleared a one-year downtrend illustrated on the two-year chart. The trendline, circa 120, pivots to support, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. Additional resistance matches the six-month range top — the 123.10-to-123.30 area — and an eventual close higher would more firmly signal a trend shift. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has asserted a strong summer downtrend, and remains tenuously positioned.

The August low rests at 23.98, and punctuates a successful initial retest. Separately, consider that the 200-week moving average (24.23) roughly matches support. Friday marked the first weekly close lower since 2014, a precarious posture. The late-2014 rally atop the 200-week moving average preceded a massive technical breakout. More plainly, the sluggish August price action leaves the dollar vulnerable to a potential downdraft. Tactically, resistance broadly spans from about 24.55 to 24.70, an area matching the breakdown point and trendline resistance. An eventual close higher would place the brakes on dollar bearish momentum. Also see the July 25 review. Moving to U.S. sectors, the transports have survived a major technical test.

528,Matthew Lynn,8172017,MarketWatch,8102017,"Published: Aug 16, 2017 8:02 a.m. ET Levy taxes and fees, but don’t restrict their numbers By Across Spain, Croatia, Italy and now France, this summer has seen a growing rage against the tourists who swarm into those countries, block streets with their backpacks and selfie sticks, drive up the prices of apartments with their demand for Airbnb stays, and make it impossible to get a table at a café. Tourists have become the bane of many of Europe’s most beautiful cities — and locals are looking for new ways to clamp down — or even restrict the numbers coming to visit. This is a crazy response. The truth is Europe needs tourists — lots of them — to keep its economy humming. The region lacks a genuine competitive advantage in many industries. That’s not the case for tourism, where Europe’s mix of quaint towns, historical cities, authentic food and vibrant nightlife make it the No.1 destination. Yes, tourism has to be managed — priced correctly, to put it in economic terms — so it doesn’t become overwhelming. But the last thing Europeans should be doing is driving it away. Instead this is what’s happening: In Barcelona, anti-tourism protesters have been storming the beaches to reclaim them from the sunbathing hordes. Militant activists have slashed the tires on rental bikes and tour buses. There have already been protests in Mallorca and one is planned for San Sebastian for Aug. 17. In Venice, 2,000 people marched in protest against the cruise ships that fill the port. In Rome, there have been crackdowns on the numbers of people at major tourist sports, while the ancient city of Dubrovnik, where much of “Game of Thrones” is filmed, has started monitoring the numbers of people coming into the town. Now the Balearic Islands, which include Ibiza and Mallorca, have just introduced a tourist tax. Barcelona is considering a tax on tour groups, though it isn’t clear how high it would be, while other cities are looking at options such as restricting home rentals or directly rationing the numbers allowed in. The backlash is growing all the time. As someone who just returned from 10 days in Croatia, I can see what they are getting at. The numbers of visitors are growing all the time, and at a certain point a place becomes simply too crowded to enjoy it. A combination of low-cost airlines, the growth of rental sites like Airbnb which lower the cost of accommodation, and a generation of 20- and 30-somethings who have decided it is normal to take six or seven short trips around Europe every year have led to an exponential growth in the numbers of tourists. Read: Boorish tourists, this Croatian island doesn’t want you — and it’s far from alone in that Take Spain. The country saw a record 75.6 million tourists last year — a total that is getting close to twice its population. At current rates of growth, there will be three or four times the numbers of visitors as there are residents in another 20 years — and that may become unsustainable because the crowds will become unbearable. But that doesn’t mean Europe should be banning tourists — or even limiting their numbers. Europe doesn’t have a genuine competitive advantage in many industries anymore. Yes, it makes some great cars, airplanes, and wine, and it has lots of world-leading fashion, design and publishing houses. It even has a few world-beating technology companies. But in reality, none of those can’t be competed out of existence one day. The Japanese make great cars as well, and the South Koreans aren’t far behind. The Chinese will be making excellent planes pretty soon, and the United States is way ahead of any European nation in technology. It is hard to pin down any single industry where the continent has a definitive advantage — and with an aging population, the highest welfare costs in the world, and some of the highest wages as well, it is hard to see any emerging. There is one industry, however, where its position is just about unbeatable, and it is one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing: Tourism. Read: As anti-tourism marches spread across Europe, how not to be an ‘ugly American’ on vacation Sure, the U.S. gets a lot of visitors, and so does China. Compared with their size, however, European destinations stand out. France is the world’s most visited country, and Spain, Italy, Germany, and even the drizzly U.K. are all in the top 10. By some measures, it is the world’s biggest single industry, accounting for 3.1% of global GDP directly, and close to 10% in total. Even better, it generates jobs on a vast scale; no one has yet really worked out how to automate a hotel. Globally, it accounts for 292 million jobs, one in every 10. It is hard to see anyone ever matching Europe’s position. Sure, you can build a Disney theme park anywhere, and you can always throw up another luxury hotel if you can find some spare beach. But you can’t suddenly create another Venice, Barcelona, Dubrovnik or London. People are always going to want to visit those cities. They have an unparalleled heritage that can’t be duplicated. In the language of business schools, the barriers to entry are absolute. Read: Move over, London and Paris — these unlikely foreign cities have seen a spike in popularity this summer True, European cities need to find ways of managing the tourist hordes. There is no reason not to charge for access to the most beautiful squares or ports at peak time. As any economist will tell you, price is a pretty good way of distributing a scarce resource. Nor is there anything wrong with imposing taxes that help pay for new transport facilities or better ways of managing the flow of people. But it would be a huge mistake to start limiting the numbers, or to allow protesters to make tourists feel unwelcome. There is nothing wrong with being a giant theme park. Indeed, that may well be the continent’s best bet economically — but it can’t get there by scaring away the tourists. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

 jumped nearly 30%. Market participants said they were also following reports that Gary Cohn was resigning as economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House has countered those rumors. U.S. equity benchmarks had been facing selling pressure at the start of trade, as European markets ended lower after a three-day winning streak. “In Europe, we had weakness out of the gate and then we had worries about the Cohn news,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. “With the light volume, Barcelona is not something that the market is going to handle well.” The equity market was also digesting minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, as well as the dissolution of a pair of Trump’s business-advisory panels, which underscores the president’s challenges in promoting his Wall Street-friendly policies. The president has faced a furor after he repeatedly blamed “both sides” for violence last weekend at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Overall, Fed minutes were read as dovish, lowering expectations of another rate increase this year. “There’s no direct market impact in what Trump has done recently, but if things continue to be so polarized that his agenda is completely dead on arrival, that would have a negative impact,” Alpine’s Spellman said.

531,Barbara Kollmeyer,8172017,MarketWatch,8102017,"Published: Aug 17, 2017 4:27 p.m. ET Officials embark on terrorism investigation By MADRID (MarketWatch) — A popular promenade in Barcelona, Spain, became a scene of panic and devastation on Thursday after a van rammed pedestrians, leaving a dozen people dead and dozens more injured. The incident took place on Las Ramblas, a long, tree-lined street that is typically packed with tourists and locals, around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. Eastern time). Local media were at one point reporting that hostages were being held at a bar near the scene of the attack by other assailants, but later reports cast doubt on the matter. The Associated Press cited the regional president in reporting that two suspects had been arrested. The Wall Street Journal, citing the jidahist-activity-monitoring organization SITE Intelligence Group, reported that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, tweeted that terrorists would never defeat a united people who love freedom. The seaside city was on lockdown in the immediate wake of the attack, with residents told to not leave their homes and many reported to be sheltering inside stores and restaurants and bars that closed the moment news of the attack reached them. S'acaba de produir atropellament massiu a les Rambles de Barcelona, per part d'una persona amb una furgoneta. Possiblement varis ferits Media reports in Spain and the U.S. indicated the police were treating the incident as a terrorist attack. The police presence on streets in the Spanish capital Madrid, some 600 kilometers southwest of Barcelona, was sharply escalated in the wake of the Barcelona attack. Nathalie Lezcano Sticchi, a 28-year-old resident of Barcelona who lives near the area, told MarketWatch she had passed the scene of the attack just five minutes before, stepping off the Ramblas to go into a Zara clothing store on a side street. “When I was on the first floor, one of the guys who was working [at Zara] said, ‘You have to go outside, we are going to close because something is happening at the Ramblas,’ ” Sticchi said in a telephone interview. She said a friend had forwarded her a message from his mother, who had been at Las Ramblas and seen a truck crashing into people. Sticchi ran to her house, as stores drew their shutters all around her. “People were running everywhere, and no one understood what was going on,” she said, “and I started hearing ambulances.” Several metro lines were closed in Barcelona, and the area remained sealed off into the evening. Police were urging individuals not to share images of the crash site on social media. They also thanked the media for pixellating images they had chose to use of victims: GRACIAS a todos los medios y particulares que estáis pixelando y obviando imágenes duras de víctimas y de operativo policial. #RESPETO Trucks are normally allowed up the Ramblas to make deliveries, and according to Sticchi it has a fairly heavy police presence. Spain hasn’t suffered a major attack on its soil since 2004, when an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell detonated simultaneous explosions on the Cercanias commuter train in Madrid on March 11. The attack, which took place three days before Spain’s general election, killed 192 people and injured thousands. The van attack on Las Ramblas killed 12 and injured 80, according to an NBC News report citing the regional president. The Barcelona scene is one that has become all too familiar in Europe. A deadly truck attack in Nice, France, in July of last year left 86 people dead and hundreds injured. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. In December 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for those attacks, along with a deadly attack near London Bridge in June. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

533,Emma Court,8172017,MarketWatch,8102017,"Published: Aug 15, 2017 12:15 p.m. ET CEO Frazier made the decision two days after deadly violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. By Merck & Co. Inc. Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier said Monday that he will leave a presidential manufacturing advisory council, tying that decision both to his role “as CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience,” two days after deadly violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Two other CEOs followed his lead later that day. “Our country’s strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs. America’s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people area created equal,” Frazier said in a statement, adding: “I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” President Donald Trump, whose immediate response to Charlottesville was widely condemned for not specifically censuring white supremacists, attacked Frazier — one of the few black CEOs of a major U.S. company and the only black member of the president’s manufacturing-jobs panel — nearly immediately afterward and later Monday evening. “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma

Later, he added that the company was “taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!” After the Twitter exchange Monday morning, though, the president issued a more explicit statement condemning racism and saying that “those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.” Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! .@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES! Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Scott Paul, head of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership between manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union, have also left the president’s manufacturing council, following Frazier’s lead. Under Armour “engages in innovation and sports, not politics,” Plank said. Paul called it “the right thing” to do. Intel’s Krzanich went into more detail. “I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,” he said in a statement. “We should honor — not attack — those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values.” Other corporate executives have left White House councils in response to previous presidential actions, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co. CEO Robert Iger, but the president did not attack either after their announcements. Merck voluntarily released information about its U.S. drug-pricing practices earlier this year. Several drug makers have also done so, though they remain the exception, not the rule.

When a car plowed into another vehicle near a group of counterprotesters on Saturday, one person was killed and nearly 20 were injured. According to the New York Times, at least 34 people were injured in total that day. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides — on many sides,” President Trump said afterward. Democrats and Republicans criticized the president at the time for not singling out the white supremacists and not describing the attack as domestic terrorism.

                                    CEO John Maraganore and privately-held Yumanity Therapeutics CEO Tony Coles both said on Monday that they supported Merck’s Frazier. Frazier took a principled stance and showed strong leadership, Coles said, adding, “these times try men’s souls. We need to all speak plainly vs. wrong.” Box CEO Aaron Levie also chimed in a “bravo” to Frazier’s statement. General Electric Chairman Jeff Immelt plans to stay on the president’s manufacturing council, according to a company statement, because “it is important for GE to participate in the discussion on how to drive growth and productivity in the U.S.” “GE has no tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism, and we strongly condemn the violent extremism in Charlottesville over the weekend,” the statement said. We’ve seen the terror of white supremacy & racist violence before. It's a moral issue - an affront to America. We must all stand against it Other companies said recent events in Charlottesville would spur corporate changes. GoDaddy Inc. said that it will no longer host the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, “as they have violated our terms of service.” The move appeared to be in response to a hateful Daily Stormer post about the woman who was killed in Charlottesville. Cloud-communications platform Twilio will add “an explicit prohibition of hate speech” to its acceptable-use policy, CEO Jeff Lawson said Sunday, adding that it “hope[d] other tech [companies] do the same.” See:  GoDaddy kicks off neo-Nazi site for violating terms of service Tesla’s Musk left the president’s strategic and policy forum and the manufacturing jobs initiative in June after the president pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.

534,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ohio’s Department of Insurance said on Thursday that non-profit managed care company CareSource will sell health plans in Paulding County next year - the last county in the United States that would have been without Obamacare individual coverage in 2018. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said on Wednesday that only Paulding County in northwestern Ohio was projected to be a “bare county” with no insurers in 2018, while 1,478 counties could have only one issuer next year. Just a month ago, CMS said there were 40 counties projected to have no insurers next year. Health insurers are facing an upheaval in their businesses amid growing uncertainty about healthcare legislation under President Donald Trump, who seeks to follow through on his promise to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans, leaving hundreds of U.S. counties at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018. But other insurers, like Centene Corp, have filled those gaps, expanding into new counties that had lost their coverage options. In June, Centene said it would enter into three new states and would expand operations in six existing markets in 2018. ","

535,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"McDonald’s, in a policy statement, said it is working on antibiotic plans for other meats, dairy cows and laying hens. McDonald’s is requiring suppliers of chicken meat to begin phasing out the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization as “highest priority critically important antimicrobials” (HPCIA) to human medicine. Public health and consumer groups applauded the move, which is not as strict as the company’s policy for the United States, where already for a year suppliers have provided the chain with chickens raised without antibiotics deemed important to human health. In January 2018, HPCIAs will be gone from McDonald’s chickens in Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Europe. Only in Europe the company will make an exception for Colistin, a last resort antibiotic. By the end of 2019, suppliers in Australia and Russia will stop using HPCIAs and European suppliers plan to remove Colistin. Suppliers in all other markets will comply by January 2027. “Our goal is to have this policy implemented before this date,” McDonald’s said in its posted antibiotic policy update. McDonald’s told a group of consumer and environmental organizations on Aug. 17 that 74 percent of its global chicken sales will conform to this policy as of January 2018, Consumers Union, the policy division of Consumer Reports, said in a statement. Consumers Union also said the company told the group that it hopes to have a timeline soon for reducing medically important antibiotics from its beef supply. McDonald’s declined comment on sales figures and its plans for beef. More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. “If fully implemented, (the plans) could be a total game changer that could transform the marketplace given the company’s massive buying power,” Jean Halloran, Consumers Union’s director of food policy initiatives, said in a statement.

536, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"DEADLY AGENT: A sarin attack in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta killed hundreds of men, women and children in August, 2013. Despite international condemnation, attacks with chemicals continue. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Nearly four years after President Bashar al-Assadâs government promised to get rid of its stockpile of chemical weapons, gas attacks are still commonplace. What went wrong? By  Anthony Deutsch Filed Aug. 17, 2017, 10 a.m. GMT THE HAGUE â In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit. When they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals. âLook, there is nothing to see,â said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door. So why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building. The incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syriaâs weapons of mass destruction. Related content Slideshow: An invisible enemy Video: Anthony Deutsch on how he uncovered the problems facing weapons inspectors in Syria Video: Interview with Angela Kane, former UN high representative for disarmament Timeline: U.N.-OPCW investigations Â into Syrian chemical weapons Syria investigator del Ponte quits, blaming U.N. Security Council A promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. They suspect that President Bashar al-Assadâs regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled. There have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone. âThe cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and thatâs a polite way of describing it,â Angela Kane, who was the United Nationâs high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. âWere they happily collaborating? No.â âWhat has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,â she added. That frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. âI have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,â she said. âWe are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.â The extent of Syriaâs reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectorsâ relationship with Assadâs administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters: - Syriaâs declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors.Â Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin. - Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not âscientifically credible.â Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said. âWhy, my God, three-and-a-half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that, I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people.â - At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syriaâs military. - In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, threeÂ sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syriaâs chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syriaâs disclosures. ""There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,"" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters. But he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job âto ensure the full complianceâ of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame. Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the countryâs cooperation with international inspectors. âI assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,â he told Reuters in an interview. Sharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse. SARIN ATTACK On Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assadâs forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil.â In the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assadâs government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to openÂ its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme â after previously denying it had any chemical weapons. Syria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States. But there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used. And in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syriaâs foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy. Reuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters. The OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said. The second problem was a switch of tactics by Assadâs forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assadâs forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine. Â Although less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorineâs use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United NationsÂ to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids. A source involved in monitoring Syriaâs chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as âa weapon of terrorâ to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014. âThe base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. Thatâs why they started using chlorine,â said the source. A senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.

The Syrian armed forces denied using chemical weapons. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syriaâs chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syriaâs declaredÂ stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said. OPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. ItÂ concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. Uzumcu said the teamâs conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban. Kane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the governmentâs Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programmeâs headquarters. âWhy, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,â Kane said. Uzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of aÂ separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW. âThe secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,â Uzumcu said. He said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence. Uzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syriaâs membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation. Uzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syriaâs chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities. POLITICAL DEADLOCK The Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council. In 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacksÂ but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan. The United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks. Western governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change. Russian officials did not respond to a request for comment. SARIN FOUND Former U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said. A key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives âTo my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombsâ payload,â said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was âa real, high-level, command structure behind this.â Syrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs. The team is also examining the deaths Â of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syriaâs deputy foreign minister, said in the interview Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem. Sellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. âIs there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?â he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well. The attack means either âthat someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,â Sellstrom said. 2013U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reach an agreement on the elimination of Syriaâs chemical weapons. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon establishes United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. Headed by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom and comprised of experts from the World Health Organization and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), it is tasked with looking into possible use of chemical weapons following reports of an attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal. It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds. 2014OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syriaâs declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can ânot fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.â OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, âto establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.â The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. It is not tasked with assigning blame. 2015United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria is established to identify individuals or entities behind chemical weapons attacks. 2016Joint Investigative Mechanism concludes that Syrian government forces used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three cases and that Islamic State militants used sulphur mustard. OPCW executive council adopts decision condemning Syrian government and Islamic State for chemical weapons use after a vote that split the body and signaled an end to U.S.-Russia cooperation. 2017OPCW Fact Finding Mission concludes that sarin was used in an April 4 attack in the Khan Sheikhoun area of northern Syria, the most deadly use of the nerve agent in three years. It does not assign blame.

537, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India has granted Pfizer Inc a patent for its powerful pneumonia vaccine Prevenar 13, in a blow to some health groups that said this would put the treatment out of reach of thousands in poorer nations. The decision by India’s patent office bars other companies from making cheaper copies of the vaccine and allows Pfizer to exclusively sell it in India until 2026. It’s a big victory for the U.S. drugmaker in a market that has the world’s largest number of pneumonia cases, a lung disease that kills nearly a million children a year globally. The decision also has international implications, as several poorer nations rely on India’s robust drugs industry to supply cheaper copies of medicines and vaccines. It also comes at a time of ongoing U.S. pressure on India to tighten its patent laws. The United States Trade Representative expressed concerns about India’s intellectual property laws in a report in June, and listed it among countries whose IP laws unfairly favour local companies. Pfizer’s vaccine protects children and adults from 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria, and a full vaccination course costs about $170 on India’s private market. India started giving out the vaccine for free under its national immunisation program earlier this year, but the rollout like that of most vaccines in the program, is in phases, so only about 2.1 million of the 25 million eligible people in the country will get it this year. The patent grant means Indian companies won’t be able to make the vaccine for domestic use, or exports. ""Manufacturers will have to find new routes to develop a non-infringing (pneumonia) vaccine, which may delay the availability of competing products in the pipeline from Indian producers,"" the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement. (bit.ly/2vU4rUk) MSF filed an objection to Pfizer's patent request last year on the grounds that a patent would deprive many developing nations of cheaper copies. (reut.rs/1QJEdXq) At least one Indian company, Panacea Biotec Ltd, is developing a cheaper form of the vaccine, and had also filed an opposition to Pfizer’s patent request last year. A source familiar with the matter said Panacea is considering filing a post-grant opposition. Separately, MSF said it was reviewing its legal options in the matter. Pfizer’s patent on the same vaccine was revoked by the European Patent Office last year, and is being challenged in South Korea and the United States, MSF said. The pharmaceutical giant has made the vaccine available at discounted prices under the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) - an international public-private partnership to improve access to vaccines in the world’s poorest countries. More than 50 countries are eligible to procure the vaccine through GAVI, according to the organization’s website. Following criticism over the high price of Prevenar 13, Pfizer reduced the vaccine price to non-governmental organisations last November, seeking to protect vulnerable people from illness in humanitarian crises. Pfizer welcomed the granting of the patent, saying Prevenar 13 took two-and-a-half years to produce, and was launched in India in 2010. “Pfizer remains committed towards further enhancing access of this vaccine in India, both in the market as well as through partnership with the Government to expand introduction in the public program,” a spokeswoman in India said.

538, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - As an influx of asylum seekers crossing from the United States strains Canada’s immigration system, the country is ramping up its deportation of migrants, government data shows. Deportations of Mexicans, who have flocked to Canada in growing numbers after a visa requirement was lifted in December, was already 66 percent higher in the first eight months of 2017 than the total from the previous year. Deportations of Haitians, thousands of whom have crossed into Canada illegally in the hopes of avoiding deportation from the United States, have also soared. Canada has deported 474 so far this year, compared to 100 for all of 2016 when the government lifted its own ban on deportations to Haiti, in place since a devastating 2010 earthquake. Overall, 5,529 people have been deported as of Tuesday, compared to 7,357 for all of 2016, the data shows. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board has called a rise in asylum-seekers through the U.S. border “unsustainable,” and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, fretting about another big surge in asylum claims, has been trying to warn people away. At the same time, Canada said this week it will be granting border-crossing asylum seekers swifter access to healthcare. They will also be eligible for work permits sooner. Refugee claimants are eligible for health coverage and work permits once their claims are processed, but that can take weeks or months. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have walked across the U.S. border into Canada to file refugee claims so far this year, including 3,800 into Quebec in the first two weeks of August alone, authorities have said. Canada is on track to record the most refugee claims in a decade. ","

539, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"FATAL POLICE ENCOUNTER: This 2012 footage from a Taser-mounted camera shows Tom Schrock being stunned by the weaponâs electrified darts. Schrockâs wife had called 911 because he was having a mental health breakdown. He collapsed after being shocked and never regained consciousness. Taser-cam footage/Ontario Police Department Part 1: In the most detailed study ever of fatalities and litigation involving police use of stun guns, Reuters finds more than 150 autopsy reports citing Tasers as a cause or contributor to deaths across America. Behind the fatalities is a sobering reality: Many who die are among societyâs vulnerable â unarmed, in psychological distress and seeking help. By PETER EISLER, JASON SZEP, TIM REID and GRANT SMITH Filed Aug. 22, 2017, 11:48 a.m. GMT ONTARIO, California â As her husband stalked around the back yard, upending chairs and screaming about demons, Nancy SchrockÂ knew he was unraveling fast. She dialed the police. âHe needs to be in the hospital,âÂ she told a 911 dispatcher.Â It was 10:24 p.m. on aÂ Thursday in June 2012. âHeâs really, really, really bad.â Tom Schrock had struggled with depression and occasional drug problemsÂ throughout their 35-year marriage, and his manic episodes had grown more fierce since their oldest child died three years earlier of a heroin overdose. Police had visited the familyâs ranch-style house east of Los Angeles more than a dozen times. Typically, Tom was taken to the hospital, medicated and sent home after 72 hours. Not this time. Three officers answered the call, categorized by the dispatcher as a disturbance involving an unarmed man with mental health issues. Nancy took them through the house to the back; Santiago Mota, a veteran cop, drew his Taser. As officers came out the back door, Tom strode toward them, arms at his side, hands closed. They ordered him to stop, but he kept coming, muttering, âGet out.â Mota fired the Taser.

Mota followed, pressed the electric stun gun to Tomâs chest and fired again. The 57-year-old collapsed, gasping, unresponsive. He never regained consciousness. âI called for help,â Nancy said. âI didnât call for them to come and kill him.â The San Bernardino County Coroner labeled the cause of Schrockâs death âmultifactorial,â ruling Tom died from a lack of oxygen to the brain due to cardiac arrest following âlaw enforcement intervention.â First among the âcontributing causes:â use of a Taser. The SchrocksÂ sued Ontario police and the weaponâs manufacturer, Taser International Inc. They contended the stun guns wereÂ inherently dangerous, and accused the department of failing to properly train officers on the risks of using the weapons on people with mental health problems. The city settled for $500,000. The case against Taser was dismissed in June; both sides declined to say whether there was a settlement. As thousands of police forces across America have embraced Tasers, the outlines of the Schrock case have grown familiar: a Taser shot, an unintended death, a damage claim. But the episodeâs nuances â a mentally ill victim, a complex death investigation, a debate over the weaponâs use â tell a deeper story. Tom Schrockâs death is one tragedy in a larger constellation of fatalities involving Tasers explored by Reuters in a first-of-its-kind examination of deaths and lawsuits involving the stun guns. Reuters documented 1,005 incidents in the United States in which people died after police stunned them with Tasers, nearly all since the early 2000s â the most thorough accounting to date of fatal encounters involving the paralyzing stun guns. Many of the casualties are among society's vulnerable. A quarter of the people who died, like Schrock, were suffering from a mental health breakdown or neurological disorder. In nine of every 10 incidents, the deceased was unarmed. More than 100 of the fatal encounters began with a 911 call for help during a medical emergency. Itâs impossible to know precisely what role the Taser played in many of the deaths documented by Reuters.Â A review ofÂ more than 400Â of the fatal encounters â those in which court documents provide a relatively detailed account of what happened â indicates Tasers were the only form of force allegedly used by police in about one in four of the cases. The rest involved both Tasers and other forms of force. Most independent researchers whoâve studied the weapons agree deaths are rare when Tasers are used properly. But the probability of dying from a Taser shock in a police encounter may be incalculable, researchers say, citing a lack of official data on stun-gun use, the fact that deaths often have more than one cause, and other complexities. No government agency tracks fatalities in police incidents where Tasers are used. Autopsies are not public in some states. And coroners and medical examiners use varying standards to assess a Taserâs role in a death. The language of their rulings ranges from detailed and rigorous to thin and opaque. âI called for help. I didnât call for them to come and kill him.â Against thatÂ curtain of uncertainty, Taser International has insisted for years that its weapons are almost never to blame when someone dies after being stunned. Almost always,Â the company says, those deaths result from drug use, underlying physiological conditions such as heart problems, or other police force used along with the Taser. The company asserts that only 24 people have ever died fromÂ Tasers â 18 from fatal head or neck injuries in falls caused by a Taser strike, and six from fires sparked by the weaponâs electrical arc. Not a single person, the manufacturer says, has died from the direct effects of the Taserâs powerful shock to the heart or body. Official records suggest otherwise. Reuters obtained autopsy findings for 712 of the 1,005 deaths it documented.Â In 153Â of those cases,Â or more than a fifth, the Taser was cited asÂ aÂ cause orÂ contributing factor in the death, typically asÂ one of several elements triggering the fatality. Most of the other autopsies cited a combination of heart and medical conditions, drug use and various forms of trauma. The deaths pose a challenge for U.S. law enforcement at a time when protests over police killings have spurred cities to seek safer ways to control combative subjects. The Taser â a weapon nearly universally embraced since the early 2000s as an alternative to firearms â is widely seen as crucial to safer policing. About 90 percent of Americaâs roughly 18,000 police agencies now issue Tasers. Tasers fire two darts connected to the stun gun by thin wires. When the darts hit a target, a pulsed current triggers a paralyzing neuromuscular response that gives police several seconds to restrain the subject. The gun can also be pressed directly against the bodyÂ âÂ the âdrive stunâ mode âÂ causing intense pain, but without the dartsâ paralyzing effects. Many officers have taken a Taser shock in training, and they attest to its agonizing power. âThe Taser caused my whole body to lock up,Â and the pain would compare to a whole-body charley horse,â Salt Lake County Deputy Sheriff Tiana Broos once testified. âI felt like I was going to suffocate.â Independent studiesÂ have found that when used properly, Tasers lower the rate of injury incurred by both police and the people they confront. The company estimates its weapons have been deployed more than 3 million times in the field. Taser keepsÂ its own log of deadly incidents involving its signature stun guns, which it declined to share. The 1,005 deaths identified by ReutersÂ total 44 percent more than the 700 reported by Amnesty International at the end of 2016, despiteÂ the news agencyâsÂ use of stricter criteria in determining which incidents to count. Taser says these tallies give an exaggerated picture of the weaponsâ hazards because they suggest Tasers caused all those deaths, when most involved other types of police force as well.Â The devices have saved tens of thousands of lives, the company says.Â All weapons carry risks, said Steve Tuttle, the companyâs vice president for communications, but Tasers are âthe safest force option available to law enforcement.â Tuttle also said the autopsy results collected by Reuters are unreliable because they were not âpeer reviewedâ âÂ a standard for studies published in medical journals, although not applicable in courts of law. The medical examiners and pathologists around the country who decided the official cause of death in those cases may not understand the weaponsâ physiological effects, he said, and may be âover-listingâ potential factors in their rulings to avoid being criticized for possible omissions. âUltimately, Taser is not responsible for educating every medical examiner on the subtleties of electrocution,â Tuttle said.  After Reuters explained its findings to Taser, the company sent an alert to law enforcement groupsÂ summarizingÂ some ofÂ the central points of this series, describing them as ânot newâ and promising to provide âkey resourcesâ to repudiate the reports. Taser International, which acquired the stun-gun technology in the 1990s, changed its name in April to Axon Enterprise Inc. The new name, the company said, reflects its expanding business mission, including police body cameras and software used to manage evidence. MENTAL HEALTH AND TASERS Taser won immense popularity for its devices through a singular marketing focus: Instead of resorting to lethal gunfire or potentially dangerous physical confrontations, it told police departments, they could control combative subjects with a paralyzing stun. Yet as the cases explored by Reuters reveal, stun-gun encounters can turn deadly. Often, those killed include people struggling with mental illness, emotional breakdowns or seizure disorders. Encounters with such peopleÂ have become more frequent as cuts in government-funded mental health services have thrust police into the role of first responders for those in psychological crisis. One in every 100 police calls involves a person with a mental health disorder, according to research by the American Psychiatric Association. Too often, experts say, officers see Tasers as a go-to weapon in those circumstances. âCops have been turned into mental health workers on the street,â said Ken Wallentine, former chief of law enforcement for the Utah Attorney General, who advises police departments on use of force. âI fear that some police training and some police practices have allowed the crowding out of persuasion,â he said, âand the Taser has become the default tool.â Under law, it is up to police departments, not the manufacturer, to mandate when cops should deploy stun guns;Â a handful of states, such as Connecticut, have codified general rules of use. Some federal courts have held that Tasers should only be used on actively aggressive subjects, a view being adopted by a growing number of departments.Â And the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement think tank, advises against using Tasers on âpersons in medical/mental crisis.âÂ But police policies vary widely. Taser itself has sent mixed messagesÂ about using its weapons on the mentally ill, Reuters found in an examination of legal filings andÂ of hundreds of pages of warnings and training materials issued by the company over the past 15 years. When Tasers began gaining popularity with police in the early 2000s, the company touted the weapons as an effective and relatively safe way to control people suffering a mental health crisis or intoxicated by drugs or alcohol. âWe did see those as potential uses of the device,â Taser President Rick Smith said in a 2007 deposition. In materials provided to police trainers in 2004, Taser said its stun gun was âbecoming widely accepted as the premier toolâ for police units that deal with âemotionally disturbed persons.â In recent years, the company has been more cautionary. Taser issued revised training materials in 2013 that advised police to avoid shocking someone âwho is actually or perceived to be mentally ill.â But that guidance, offered on the 66th slide in a 231-slide âUser Courseâ presentation, was characterized as a liability consideration â not a safety issue. The companyâs official warnings to law enforcement make no mention of people with mental illness. Instead, they caution against using Tasers on people who exhibit âextreme agitationâ and âbizarre behavior.â For police on the street, figuring out who meets those criteria can be daunting, officers and police lawyers say. Assessing someoneâs mental state on the fly is âone of the most difficult things an officer has to do,â said Eric Carlson, a training and counseling officer at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Santiago Mota, the Ontario, California, police officer who fired the Taser against Schrock,Â said in a deposition he was unaware Schrock was mentally ill upon arriving at the familyâs home. The police dispatcher had listed the call as a â5150 hold,â code for a forced detention for mental evaluation. Mota said he missed the alert. âBy the time I'm arriving, I don't â I don't hear â5150,â â Mota said.Â After being stunned, Schrock went into ventricular fibrillation, a condition marked by a wildly erratic heartbeat. He died seven days later.Â The coroner found he had an array of heart problems, some likely exacerbated by a period of methamphetamine use two decades earlier, when he was caught making the drug and sentenced to probation. Schrock, a hospital technician for much of his working life, was a gentle father who frequently took his children on camping trips and hikes when they were younger, Nancy said. âI mean, that was the love of my life, the father of my kids, and my life will never be the same again,â she said. The Ontario Police Department declined to discuss the case or make Mota available for an interview. Taser spokesman Tuttle acknowledged concerns about using the companyâs weapons on the mentally ill. âYeah, there are at-risk groups, and that is why we identify them,â Tuttle told Reuters. The use of Tasers on people in mental health crises âcertainly is a topic thatâs out there.â Still, Tuttle said, the companyâs warnings do not prohibit Taser use on people in mental distress. âIt doesnât say, âYou shall not use this on someone that may be emotionally disturbed.â â Taserâs warnings are âguidelines,â Tuttle said, and it is up to police departments and their officers to decide when to use the weapons. Courts have largely endorsed that position, finding that police are responsible for policies on Taser use. Little research exists on Taser use against people in mental health crises and other vulnerable individuals.Â Thatâs in part because of ethical constraints on scientists, said Jena Neuscheler, co-author of a Taser study by the Stanford University Criminal Justice Center. âWe donât know how it impacts people who have a mental illness, who are under the influence of drugs, who have a heart defect, who might be pregnant,â she said. âWe canât test it on those populations.â The Stanford study foundÂ that Tasers shouldnât be used on significant swaths of the population. TheÂ center analyzed about 150 studies and concluded Tasers are safe âfor use on healthy individuals who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, are not pregnant, and do not suffer from mental illness â so long as the individual receives only a standard five-second shock to an approved area of the body.â Â âDONâT TASE HIM!â MacAdam Lee MasonÂ looked dazed as he stumbled outside the Vermont home he shared with Theresa Davidonis and her children â the sort of behavior they recognized as typical when he was recovering from a seizure. The state police surrounding the coupleâs house that June afternoon in 2012 saw things differently. Mason was 39,Â an artist who had struggled with seizures and mental illness since a brain injury in a high-school car accident. Troopers had visited the house earlier that afternoon after he had called a counseling center to report heâd had a seizure and was angry enough to kill himself â or someone else. Davidonis sent them away, explaining that Mason often was irrational and incoherent after seizures. He posed no threat and had no weapons, she added. Now the police had returnedÂ for a follow-up check. Davidonis was gone and no one answered the door. As troopers took positions around the property, suspecting Mason was hiding in the surrounding woods, Davidonis pulled up, returning from an errand. Trooper David Shaffer set up behind a tree to the side of the house with an M-4 assault rifle. He spotted Mason crossing the yard, looking like he was in a âhaze,â Shaffer later told investigators. Shaffer approached Mason, gun at âlow readyâ position, and ordered him to the ground. Mason held up his hands and sat on the grass. But as Shaffer yelled at him to lie face-down, Mason stood again. âShoot me,â Mason said. Shaffer later said Mason seemed angry and moved toward him as if preparing to throw a punch â a description Davidonis disputes. As she watched, Shaffer switched from the rifle to his Taser. âI was screaming, âDonât Taser him! He just had a seizure, youâll kill him!â âÂ Davidonis said. âBut the cop just fired and the barbs hit him in the chest and he kind of crumbled, like slow motion.â Mason went into cardiac arrest and died. The medical examiner attributed the cause of death to the Taser:Â âsudden cardiac death due to conducted electrical weapon discharge,â using a generic term for stun gun. Masonâs mother, Rhonda Taylor, carries his ashes with her in a small wooden box he painted with a landscape scene. âYou know, when a police officer kills someone like this, someone whoâs mentally ill, it kills their mother, too,â she said. After Masonâs death, Taylor helped the American Civil Liberties Union lobby state legislators for restrictions on Taser use. In 2014, Vermont passedÂ a lawÂ limiting the circumstances under which police can deploy Tasers and setting training standards for officers who carry them. The law, following similar legislation in Connecticut, lays out parametersÂ for using Tasers on people struggling with mental illness or emotional crises.Â For instance, Tasers should only be fired at people showing âactive aggression.â âThey canât just use a Taser on people because they donât want to take the time to talk with them,â Taylor said, sobbing. âNobody should have to lose a child like this.â The Vermont State Police declined to comment or to make Shaffer available for an interview, citing ongoing litigation with the family.Â Prosecutors concluded the trooper acted lawfully. The challenges of interacting with people in mental crises have prompted many police departments to adopt âcrisis intervention training,â or CIT. Pioneered in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1988, the training emphasizes de-escalation strategiesÂ in lieu of using a Taser or other kinds of force. A decade ago, an estimated 400 police departments provided CIT programs, according to the U.S. Justice Departmentâs Bureau of Justice Assistance. Today, the American Psychiatric Association puts the number closer to 3,000. Still, that comprises a fraction of the estimated 18,000 local, state and federal police agencies in the United States. In 2016, the International Association of Chiefs of Police urged all police forces to set a goal of having at least 20 percent of their officers undergo CIT training. The Phoenix Police Department began CIT instruction in 2000 and has put more than 500 officers through the training. Since 2015, all officers also must take an eight-hour course on managing people with mental illness. The departmentâs Taser use has dropped sharply, from 330 deployments a year in 2006 to 158 in 2016. Thereâs no way to know for sure how much of the decline stems from the training, said Sergeant Vince Lewis, who teaches Taser and use-of-force classes. But Tasers are now seen more as a last resort in Phoenix, he said. âThe best tools in our toolbox when weâre dealing with somebody suffering from mental illness are time and talk.â âSOMEONEâS TRYING TO KILL USâ People in a mental crisis often are confused and frightened when police confront them. Tensions can escalate rapidly, especially if officers are not properly trained, said Denise Juliano-Bult, who helps coordinate research on services forÂ the mentally ill at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. âThat can lead to unfortunate incidents where the people with mental illness can get injured and the police can get injured,â she said. On an April evening in 2015, Lucky Phounsy, 32, called 911Â from the home of his mother and stepfather in San Diego, California. Phounsy had become delusional after four days without sleep â a result, the family suspects, of drugs taken at a music festival days earlier. âThere was no effort to talk to him. It was shocking.â Phounsy was at the house with his wife, Loan Thi Minh Nguyen, to celebrate their sonâs second birthday. As the evening progressed, Phounsyâs stepfather, Greg Kelley, and Loan decided to drive him to the emergency room to be sedated. At 10:13 p.m. Phounsy called 911. âI have an emergency here,â Phounsy said. âSomeoneâs trying to kill us.â Kelley took the phone. âThe person that called you is getting very, very paranoid. We are trying to get him to the hospital.â He told the dispatcher there were no weapons in the house. In an interview, Loan and Kelley said Phounsy was âtremendously relievedâ when San Diego County Sheriffâs deputies arrived. Officers introduced themselves and immediately asked Phounsy to turn around and raise his hands, the family said. He started to comply but then asked them why. One officer cursed; another told him to place his hands behind his back and placed one hand in a handcuff. âWait a minute. Iâm the one who called you. Why are you asking me to put my hands up?â Phounsy asked, according to Kelleyâs deposition. At that, the second officer shot him with a Taser. âThere was no effort to talk to him,â Kelley said. âIt was shocking.â Stunned a second time, the family says, Phounsy became combative. He fought with the male officer, fracturing the lawmanâsÂ nose. More officers arrived, and Phounsy was hit with batons, hogtied and put into an ambulance, the family says. On the way to theÂ hospital his heart stopped. He later was pronounced brain dead and died after the family removed him from life support. The outcome could have been different, Loan said, âif there was a dialogue. There was no dialogue.â The police said Phounsy turned violent before the Taser was used and officers had to stun him several times to subdue him. The deputy who stunned Phounsy had received psychiatric emergency response training, a program similar to CIT that emphasizes de-escalating mental health emergencies. A report issued by San Diego County said Phounsyâs body contained trace amounts of cannabis and ecstasy, but no other illegal drugs. Nevertheless, Deputy Medical Examiner Steven Campman ruled the death an âaccidentâ â a heart attack after physical altercation and restraint, due to a âstimulant drug-related psychotic state.â Campmanâs office declined to comment. Phounsyâs family sued San Diego County and other first responders, citing excessive Taser use, among other factors. The defendants deny responsibility; the case remains open. âDONâT BE SCAREDâ Like scoresÂ of other fatal police encounters involving Tasers, Lucky Phounsy's death began with a call for help. Nearly half of those 911 calls came from a family member, including more than two dozen from mothersÂ or fathers, at least 10 from spouses or partners, and five from sisters or brothers, court records show. On the evening of Dec. 16, 2014, James Williams told his wife, Asasa,Â he felt a cold coming on. To help him sleep, he mixed over-the-counter flu medicine with a âhot toddyâ â a shot of rum and tea. âIâm going to knock this out,â he said. Around 4 a.m., he startled Asasa awake. His stomach hurt and he was cold. Asasa checked the thermostat in their four-bedroom home in Douglasville, Georgia: 80 degrees. Williams pulled the sheets tight over him and went into an epileptic seizure. A singer-songwriter and father of three boys, Williams, 43, had experienced a seizure before. Two months earlier, while at work delivering electrical supplies, he crashed into a telephone pole after going into convulsions. Emerging from his truck, Williams became confused and combative, running into traffic. Six or seven officers subdued him. Later in the hospital, he remembered nothing. This time, Asasa recalled the doctorâs instructions: Lay him on his side. Then she dialed 911. âMy husband, I believe, he had a seizure,â she told the dispatcher. âI need some help.â After she hung up, Williams paced and made a high-pitched groan she had never heard in 14 years of marriage â âkahhhh, kahhhhh.â âYou just had a seizure â¦ donât be scared,â she told him. He wrestled away, nearly knocking over a television. He banged his head on a toilet seat and pulled off his shirt. Asasa shouted for her son,Â Bashir, 18, to call 911 again.Â âTell them to hurry!â The dispatcher asked if Williams was violent. âNo,â Bashir said, âjust making a weird noise, acting weird.â Mike Shuler, a paramedic for 30 years, arrived about 4:39 a.m. with colleague Mark Wardlaw. Bashir waved them into the house. Asasa had just pulled her two younger sons, 6 and 13, from the upstairs bedroom Williams had entered. Shuler said he saw Williams hurl himself head-first over a childâs bed, smashing the wall and cutting his forehead. Bashir said the two men tackled his father. When Douglas County Sheriffâs Deputy Kenny Turner arrived at 4:41 a.m., Shuler was in the room alone with Williams, who had broken free, according to law-enforcement records and the familyâs lawsuit. âHeâs having a seizure,â Asasa told Turner, according to audio recorded by the deputyâs uniform microphone. Turner later told investigators he was unaware Williams was having a seizure and readied his Taser because Williams was combative. Turner shouted âstopâ and ârelax.âÂ He tried to wrestle Williams into handcuffs, pushing him onto the bed. But Williams got back up. âYou are going to get Tased,â Turner said.Â âStop acting wild.â He fired the Taser darts at Williams, knocking him to the bed. Williams stood again. âStop moving!â Turner shouted, pulling the trigger to deliver another five-second shock, state investigative records show.Â Williams, tangled in the electrified wires, fell again, his head hitting the floor. âHelp,â Williams said. âHelp, help.â As Williams rose, his head struck a bed railing, Turner said. Turner pulled the trigger again, knocking Williams down long enough to handcuff him. Shuler bound his legs and another paramedic administered two doses of midazolam, a sedative. Williams lost consciousness and died that evening. The coroner ruled the death ânatural,â caused by âcerebellar intracerebral hemorrhage.â Last August, Williamsâ family sued the Douglas County fire and police departments, along with Taser International.Â The family dropped the case against Taser after the company provided documents showingÂ it had warned against using its weapons on people prone to seizures, said family lawyer Jeff Gewirtz. Taser also questioned whether both the weaponâs electrified barbs made contact, noting the coroner found evidence of just one, and argued it was ""highly unlikely"" the stun gun delivered any charge that contributed to the death. But Turner told investigators the Taser jolts knocked Williams down. âSomehow it worked,â he said. Taser itself has saidÂ its weapons can deliver a paralyzing charge even if both darts don't touch skin. The Douglas County Sheriffâs OfficeÂ use of force policy prohibits police from using Tasers on people with âknown neuromuscular disorders such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or epilepsy.â District Attorney Brian Fortner found no evidence of criminal conduct by the officers. âMr. Williams died of natural causes,â he wrote. The department did not respond to an interview request. Deputy Turnerâs personnel records show that, in the decade prior, he took 153 training courses covering 1,202 hours.Â Of those courses, one was dedicated to dealing with the mentally ill. It lasted one hour.Â He didnât receive CIT instruction. Turner did log 13 hours of Taser training over a decade. Asked in sworn testimony if he could recall any warnings in the training to avoid shocking a person afflicted with epilepsy or a seizure disorder, he paused. âI donât remember any of that.â Additional reporting by Lisa Girion and Paula Seligson In a first-of-its-kind review of court documents, police reports, other public records and news accounts, Reuters compiled the most comprehensive publicÂ accounting to date of deaths and litigation that followed police use of Tasers. In all, reporters documentedÂ 1,005 people who have died in the United States following encounters with police in which Tasers were used either on their own or, more often, as part of a larger mosaic of force. In at leastÂ 153 of those cases, Reuters found, coroners or medical examiners cited the Taser as a cause or contributing factor in the death. The number of deaths linked to U.S. law enforcement incidents involving Tasers, often with other force Among the 1,000-plus fatalities, Reuters found that wrongful death lawsuits were filed in at least 442Â of the incidents. Nearly all the suits âÂ 435 âÂ were filed against police and the municipalities that employ them. Taser International, the manufacturer, was named as a defendant in 128 cases. There were three lawsuits, from 1983 to 1987, against Taser Industries Inc, a business Taser International acquired in 2003. The company recently changed its name to Axon Enterprise Inc. ReutersÂ conducted hundreds of interviews with current and former police officials, lawyers involved in lawsuits involving Tasers, academics and other independent experts, relatives of people who died and Taser International. Here are the sources of information and the methodologies behind the projectâs key findings: Deaths following Taser shocks:To identify these cases, Reuters examined thousands of court records, police reports and news stories from 1983,Â the earliest mention of a fatality identified in a police encounter where a Taser was used, through July 31, 2017. Legal records were searched using Westlaw, a database of legal filings owned by Thomson Reuters, as well as Lexis and Pacer, two other databases of legal documents. Reuters also researched news accounts nationwide. The news agencyÂ reviewed reportsÂ by other organizations that tracked deaths in incidents where Tasers were used, including the human rights group Amnesty International, and advocacy websites Truth Not Tasers and Fatal Encounters. Reuters used stricter criteria than those organizations to decide which cases to count, so our tally does not include more than three dozen deaths those organizations identified. Nevertheless, Reutersâ listing ofÂ 1,005Â deaths is 44Â percent larger than the 700 reported by Amnesty at the end of 2016. Among the cases Reuters opted not to include were those in which a person was shot with a firearm after being stunned by a Taser. The only exceptions were six cases in which the Taser use was cited in a wrongful death lawsuit or an autopsy specifically ruled out the gunshot as the primary cause of death.Â Reuters also counted only thoseÂ deaths in which it could identify the victimÂ and confirm through court documents, police reports, other public records or credible media accounts that a Taser was used. reuters investigates More Reuters investigations and long-form narratives Got a confidential news tip? Reuters Investigates offers several ways to securely contact our reporters If Reuters was unable to confirm Taser use,Â the incidentÂ wasnât counted.Â For example, some lists of fatalities involving Tasers include Mark Lee, who died in a 2006 encounter with police in Rochester, New York. News reports said police disputed the familyâs assertion that a Taser was used. Reuters omitted the case after contacting the familyâs lawyer, who said the Lees were ultimately unable to prove âdefinitivelyâ a Taser was used. Reuters included 17 cases in which people died from choking on bags of drugs while being stunned. The news agency surveyed a number of pathologists on whether a Taser shock would increase the likelihood of choking under those circumstances. They offered no clear consensus but most suggested it was possible. Taser said the only deaths that can be attributed to its stun guns involve 24 casesÂ in which the person died from secondary injuries, such as falls or fires caused by the Taser. Taser International also tracks deaths in police incidents where its weapons were used and catalogs that information in a âdatabase of in-custody deaths proximal to TASER use,â according to court testimony from company officials. The companyÂ declined to share the data with Reuters.Â SeventeenÂ of the deaths on the Reuters list occurred before Taser International acquired the technology from its inventor in 1993Â and began marketing its first version of the weapons. Autopsy findings:Taser International has long argued that its weapons are almost never to blame when someone dies after being stunned. Reuters sought autopsy results and cause-of-death rulings for all the 1,000-plus deaths.Â Many states restrict access to autopsy records and do not release them publicly. But Reuters was able to collect official cause-of-death rulings for more than 70 percent of the deaths it identified â 712Â cases. Tasers were listed as a cause of death or a contributing factor or condition in 153Â of those cases. Most of the other autopsies cited a combination of heart and medical conditions, drug use and various forms of trauma. Many of the autopsies reviewed by Reuters listed the cause of death as ""multi-factorial."" The autopsies that cited a Taser shock often included it as one of several components of their ruling. To collect the autopsies, Reuters filed public records requests in dozens of states and scores of counties. In 278Â cases, Reuters obtained full autopsies. In 348Â others, medical examiners, coroners or other local officials provided the cause-of-death findings, often with contributing factors or conditions, in writing or by reciting the information over the phone. In 86Â cases, Reuters obtained cause of death information through other official records, such as reports from state investigations or court documents. Wrongful death lawsuits:Reuters set out to identify all wrongful death suits filed in cases where someone died after being stunned with a Taser during a police encounter. The process involved constructing a series of queries using different parameters to search Westlaw, Lexis and Pacer. Reuters also combed through state court filings in dozens of states to find lawsuits. Those searches yielded several thousand suitsÂ in which a stun gun was mentioned. Reporters then reviewed all the search results and identified 442Â casesÂ in which Tasers factored into a wrongful death claim, sifting out injury suits and the vast majority of suits in which the subjectÂ was shot with a firearm. In 120 of the 442 cases, or 27 percent, the Taser was the only force alleged in the claim; in the remaining 322 cases, the stun guns were alleged to have been part of a broader array of police force. Most of those cases were filed in federal court. Because not all state courts are included in Westlaw and other legal databases,Â the 442 figureÂ likely omits some state cases. Settlements and awards:More than three-fifthsÂ of the 366 concluded lawsuits against governments, or 232,Â resulted inÂ judgments or settlementsÂ for the plaintiffs: 220 settlements and 12 judgments.Â Reuters was able to determine the payouts in 193 cases, totaling $172 million paid by cities and their insurers. That dollar figure does not include three dozen cases in which settlements remained confidential or were unavailable. The settlement and judgment totals were obtained by filing public records requests with dozens of municipalities. In some cases, government agencies declined or did not respond to requests for data. In some of those instances, Reuters was able to confirm settlement amounts through court records, lawyers or media reports. Because Reuters was not able to identify settlement amounts in dozens of cases where terms werenât disclosed, the actual total of payouts by local governments and their insurers is certainly higher than $172Â million. Taser declined to share detailed information on which cases it has settled and how much it has paid to satisfy those settlements.

540, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd said on Monday it will fund and develop multiple original drugs in partnership with Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, expanding its business scope beyond copies of existing biologic drugs. Original biotech drugs represent a business ramp-up for Samsung Bioepis, which has so far invested $1.3 billion in drug development since being founded in 2012 and has received approvals for two biosimilar drugs in Europe and one in the United States. Bioepis is part of South Korean conglomerate Samsung Group’s biopharmaceutical bet as a future growth engine, along with contract manufacturer parent Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd. The partnership will develop novel biologic drugs in “unmet disease areas”, Bioepis said in a joint statement with Takeda, adding the two companies will immediately begin working on a treatment for severe acute pancreatitis. They declined to disclose other terms of the development program. Interest in biosimilars has soared in recent years as copies of some of the world’s best-selling biologic medicines have hit the market at big discounts. As a relative latecomer to the industry, Samsung Bioepis quickly proved its development capabilities by becoming the first firm to launch a biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel in Europe last year, generating over $250 million in sales so far, according to Bioepis. It has also received both European and U.S. approval for its copy of Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade, and awaits European regulatory decisions for its biosimilar versions of AbbVie Inc’s Humira and Roche’s Herceptin. [nL3N1KF4OL][nL4N1A40FZ][nL4N1A40FZ] Samsung Bioepis will also seek partnerships with other drugmakers to become an original drugmaker that can conduct all phases of novel biologics development in 10 years, spokesman Mingi Hyun said. Samsung Group hopes the biosimilars business will develop into a new growth driver as global demand for smartphones slows, weighing on the outlook for the mobile business of flagship firm Samsung Electronics.

541, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - South Korea lifted a ban on imports of U.S. poultry and eggs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday, allowing American farmers to resume sales to the Asian country that suffered an egg shortage caused by its worst-ever bird flu outbreak. South Korea was importing more U.S. eggs earlier this year as it fought its own outbreak of bird flu. But in March, the country limited U.S. poultry imports after the first U.S. case of bird flu of the year was detected on a commercial chicken farm in Tennessee. Prior to that, Americans “were putting table eggs in there like they were going out of style,” said Jim Sumner, president of the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, a trade group. “They are in desperate need still,” he said. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, was hit hard by the deadly H5N8 bird flu strain after the first case was confirmed in November, leading to a record culling of more than 37 million farm birds, more than a fifth of its total poultry population. Last month, South Korea’s government downgraded its bird flu alert by one notch from the highest level, after more than a month passed without new cases. South Korea bans U.S. poultry imports when the United States detects any cases of bird flu. The USDA is now working to convince South Korean officials to limit future restrictions on shipments to the geographic regions in which the virus is detected. “Korea’s lifting of its most recent ban is an important move for our poultry and egg industries, but it is still just the first step,” USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. In 2014, the last full year without any bird flu-related U.S. trade restrictions in place, South Korea purchased $122 million in U.S. poultry products, including eggs, making it the United States’ tenth-largest market, according to the USDA. Last year, South Korea’s imports from all countries exceeded $350 million in 2016, but only $39 million came from the United States. ","

542, ,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"(Reuters) - Specialty pharmacy firm US Bioservices Corp has agreed to pay $13.4 million to settle U.S. government claims that it pushed patients to refill prescriptions of Novartis AG’s iron overload drug Exjade in exchange for referrals from the Swiss drugmaker. US Bioservices, a unit of drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen, agreed to pay $10.6 million to the federal government and $2.8 million to states, according to a filing on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court by Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim. The deal, which must be approved by the court, would resolve a civil lawsuit filed by Kim earlier on Tuesday claiming that U.S. federal and state insurance programs were illegally billed for Exjade prescriptions that stemmed from kickbacks. AmerisourceBergen said in a previous filing with U.S. securities regulators that it was not admitting wrongdoing as part of the settlement. According to the lawsuit, from August 2010 to March 2012, US Bioservices encouraged patients to refill Exjade prescriptions by having its nurses call them with “one-sided advice,” emphasizing the dangers of not treating iron overload and downplaying the drug’s side effects. Exjade had been linked to severe side effects including kidney and liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding, which have resulted in deaths, according to the lawsuit. US Bioservices also assigned a group of employees known as patient care coordinators to call patients and urge them to refill their prescriptions, the lawsuit said. US Bioservices competed with two other pharmacy companies that distributed the drug - BioScrip Inc and Express Scripts unit Accredo Health Group Inc - for patient referrals from Novartis. Novartis would dole out the referrals according to how many refills each pharmacy achieved, according to the lawsuit. As a result of the scheme, the government-run Medicare and Medicaid programs were billed for prescriptions “tainted” by kickbacks, violating federal law, according to the lawsuit. Novartis previously settled claims that it paid kickbacks to promote Exjade and other drugs for $390 million in 2015. BioScrip and Accredo also previously settled claims, collectively paying $75 million. The case is United States v. US Bioservices Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-cv-06353. ","

543,Andrew Beattie,8242017,Investopedia,8172017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Insider trading has been a part of the U.S. market since William Duer used his post as assistant secretary of the Treasury to guide his bond purchases in the late 1700s. In this article, we will look at some landmark incidents of insider trading. During the Roaring '20s, many Wall Street professionals, and even some of the general public, knew Wall Street was a rigged game run by powerful investing pools. Suffering from a lack of disclosure and an epidemic of manipulative rumors, people believed coattail investing and momentum investing were the only viable strategies for getting in on the profits. Unfortunately, many investors found that the coattails they were riding were actually smokescreens for hidden sell orders that left them holding the bag. Still, while the market kept going up and up, these setbacks were seen as a small price to pay in order to get in on the big game later on. In October, 1929, the big game was revealed to be yet another smokescreen. After the crash, the public was hurt, angry, and hungry for vengeance. Albert H. Wiggin, the respected head of Chase National Bank, seemed an unlikely target until it was revealed that he shorted 40,000 shares of his own company. This is like a boxer betting on his opponent – a serious conflict of interest. Using wholly-owned family corporations to hide the trades, Wiggin built up a position that gave him a vested interest in running his company into the ground. There were no specific rules against shorting your own company in 1929, so Wiggin legally made $4 million from the 1929 crash and the shakeout of Chase stock that followed. Not only was this legal at the time, but Wiggin had also accepted a $100,000 a year pension for life from the bank. He later declined the pension when the public outcry grew too loud to ignore. Wiggin was not alone in his immoral conduct, and similar revelations led to a 1934 revision of the 1933 Securities Act that was much sterner toward insider trading. It was appropriately nicknamed the ""Wiggin Act"". One of the most famous cases of insider trading made household names of Michael Milken, Dennis Levine, Martin Siegel and Ivan Boesky. Milken received the most attention because he was the biggest target for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but it was actually Boesky who was the spider in the center of the web. Boesky was an arbitrageur in the mid-1980s with an uncanny ability to pick out potential takeover targets and invest before an offer was made. When the fated offer came, the target firm's stock would shoot up and Boesky would sell his shares for a profit. Sometimes, Boesky would buy mere days before an unsolicited bid was made public - a feat of precognition rivaling the mental powers of spoon bender Uri Geller. Like Geller, Boesky's precognition turned out to be a fraud. Rather than keeping a running tabulation of all the publicly traded firms trading at enough of a discount to their true values to attract offers and investing in the most likely of the group, Boesky went straight to the source - the mergers and acquisitions arms of the major investment banks. Boesky paid Levine and Siegel for pre-takeover information that guided his prescient buys. When Boesky hit home runs on nearly every major deal in the 1980s - Getty Oil, Nabisco, Gulf Oil, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Texaco - the people at the SEC became suspicious. The SEC's break came when Merrill Lynch was tipped off that someone in the firm was leaking info and, as a result, Levine's Swiss bank account was uncovered. The SEC rolled Levine and he gave up Boesky's name. By watching Boesky - particularly during the Getty Oil fiasco - the SEC caught Siegel. With three in the bag, they went after Michael Milken. Surveillance of Boesky and Milken helped the SEC draw up a list of 98 charges worth 520 years in prison against the junk bond king. The SEC charges didn't all stick, but Boesky and Milken took the brunt with record fines and prison sentences. Although not high-ranking in terms of dollars, the case of Wall Street Journal columnist R. Foster Winans is a landmark case for its curious outcome. Winans wrote the ""Heard on the Street"" column profiling a certain stock. The stocks featured in the column often went up or down according to Winans' opinion. Winans leaked the contents of his column to a group of stockbrokers, who used the tip to take up positions in the stock before the column was published. The brokers made easy profits and allegedly gave some of their illicit gains to Winans. Winans was caught by the SEC and put at the center of a very tricky court case. Because the column was the personal opinion of Winans rather than material insider information, the SEC was forced into a unique and dangerous strategy. The SEC charged that the info in the column belonged to the Wall Street Journal, not Winans. This meant that while Winans was convicted of a crime, the WSJ could theoretically engage in the same practice of trading on its content without any legal worries. In December 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it was rejecting ImClone's new cancer drug, Erbitux. As the drug represented a major portion of ImClone's pipeline, the company's stock took a sharp dive. Many pharmaceutical investors were hurt by the drop, but the family and friends of CEO Samuel Waksal were, oddly enough, not among them. Among those with a preternatural knack for guessing the FDA's decision days before the announcement was homemaking guru Martha Stewart. She sold 4,000 shares when the stock was still trading in the high $50s and collected nearly $250,000 on the sale. The stock would plummet to just over $10 in the following months. Stewart claimed to have a pre-existing sell order with her broker, but her story continued to unravel and public shame eventually forced her to resign as the CEO of her own company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Waksal was arrested and sentenced to more than seven years in prison and fined $4.3 million in 2003. In 2004, Stewart and her broker were also found guilty of insider trading. Stewart was sentenced to the minimum of five months in prison and fined $30,000. Although the cases in this article are glaring examples, insider trading is often difficult for the SEC to spot. Detecting it involves a lot of conjecture and consideration of probabilities. While it's possible that Boesky was that good at predicting takeovers, it was highly improbable. Truth be told, the SEC has made mistakes and accused the innocent in cases that are borderline, at best. This is one of the prices we pay to guard against insiders trading on information that the public doesn't yet know. That said, Stewart offers the best example of why it's best not to trade on material insider information – leaving the moral aspect aside. If she had simply held her ImClone stock, it would have hit the $70-$80 range during the Eli Lilly takeover, making her holdings worth around $60,000 more than what she sold out for. Instead, she was fined $30,000 and ended up in jail. The risks, in this case, definitely outweighed the returns. ",Top 4 Most Scandalous Insider Trading Debacles,-0.9712

Surveillance of Boesky and Milken helped the SEC draw up a list of 98 charges worth 520 years in prison against the junk bond king. The SEC charges didn't all stick, but Boesky and Milken took the brunt with record fines and prison sentences. Although not high-ranking in terms of dollars, the case of Wall Street Journal columnist R. Foster Winans is a landmark case for its curious outcome. Winans wrote the ""Heard on the Street"" column profiling a certain stock. The stocks featured in the column often went up or down according to Winans' opinion. Winans leaked the contents of his column to a group of stockbrokers, who used the tip to take up positions in the stock before the column was published. The brokers made easy profits and allegedly gave some of their illicit gains to Winans. Winans was caught by the SEC and put at the center of a very tricky court case. Because the column was the personal opinion of Winans rather than material insider information, the SEC was forced into a unique and dangerous strategy. The SEC charged that the info in the column belonged to the Wall Street Journal, not Winans. This meant that while Winans was convicted of a crime, the WSJ could theoretically engage in the same practice of trading on its content without any legal worries. In December 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it was rejecting ImClone's new cancer drug, Erbitux. As the drug represented a major portion of ImClone's pipeline, the company's stock took a sharp dive. Many pharmaceutical investors were hurt by the drop, but the family and friends of CEO Samuel Waksal were, oddly enough, not among them. Among those with a preternatural knack for guessing the FDA's decision days before the announcement was homemaking guru Martha Stewart. She sold 4,000 shares when the stock was still trading in the high $50s and collected nearly $250,000 on the sale. The stock would plummet to just over $10 in the following months. Stewart claimed to have a pre-existing sell order with her broker, but her story continued to unravel and public shame eventually forced her to resign as the CEO of her own company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Waksal was arrested and sentenced to more than seven years in prison and fined $4.3 million in 2003. In 2004, Stewart and her broker were also found guilty of insider trading. Stewart was sentenced to the minimum of five months in prison and fined $30,000. Although the cases in this article are glaring examples, insider trading is often difficult for the SEC to spot. Detecting it involves a lot of conjecture and consideration of probabilities. While it's possible that Boesky was that good at predicting takeovers, it was highly improbable. Truth be told, the SEC has made mistakes and accused the innocent in cases that are borderline, at best. This is one of the prices we pay to guard against insiders trading on information that the public doesn't yet know. That said, Stewart offers the best example of why it's best not to trade on material insider information – leaving the moral aspect aside. If she had simply held her ImClone stock, it would have hit the $70-$80 range during the Eli Lilly takeover, making her holdings worth around $60,000 more than what she sold out for. Instead, she was fined $30,000 and ended up in jail. The risks, in this case, definitely outweighed the returns. ",Top 4 Most Scandalous Insider Trading Debacles,-0.9712

546,Dan Mangan,8242017,CNBC,8172017,"A Utah-based hospital chain pledged Wednesday to slash the number of opioid pills prescribed for patients with acute pain at its facilities by 40 percent by the end of 2018. Intermountain Healthcare's pledge comes in the face of a worsening epidemic of painkiller and heroin abuse in the United States. In 2015, there were more than 33,000 fatalities from opioid overdoses recorded — almost half of which involved prescription painkillers. If nonprofit Intermountain achieves its goal, it will reduce the number of opioid tablets it prescribes to patients with acute pain in Utah and southern Idaho by more than 5 million each year at its 22 hospitals and 180 clinics. Intermountain said it believed it is the first American health system ""to formally announce such a significant and specific amount of reduction as a target."" Dr. Marc Harrison, president and CEO of Intermountain, said, ""We really want to make sure that we reduce the potential for abuse ... but still ensure that our patients have high-quality care."" Dr. Doug Smith, Intermountain's associate medical director, noted that nationslly there is a problem with health providers tending ""to write prescriptions for more opioids than patients need, and large quantities of medications are often left over after the need for pain relief is past."" That opens the door for patients abusing their own medication, or the pills being abused by relatives or friends of a patient. To reach its reduction goal, Intermountain will be using a ""data-driven approach"" spearheaded by a ""business intelligence tool"" that the health-care system developed to track prescriptions and develop guidelines for appropriate prescribing practices, Harrison said. Intermountain also already has trained about 2,500 of its caregivers as part of the opioid reduction initiative. Sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, despite the fact that ""there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain Americans report,"" according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Utah, where most of Intermountain's facilities are located, has been particularly hard hit by the opioid crisis, with the state being ranked anywhere from seventh to 12th in the nation for overdoses, Harrison noted. Intermountain, which has 850,000 members in the health insurance plan it operates, each year has some kind of interaction with 1.2 million people in Utah, which has a population of just 3 million. ""This is a big goal,"" Harrison said of the 40 percent reduction target. ""But our communities and the people in them are suffering, and we need to do something about that."" Harrison said that the prescription practices at Intermountain, which prescribes about 12.5 million opioid pills to patients with acute pain annually, have been ""no better, no worse"" than other health-care systems. But ""we can see that there's enormous variation"" in the amount of painkillers being prescribed by different doctors across Intermountain's system, Harrison said. ""What you're seeing is what happens when there are not a lot of guidelines"" about what an appropriate amount of pills are to be prescribed for various health situations, Harrison said. Given this variation and analysis of prescribing patterns by Intermountain's staff, ""they actually think that 40 percent [reduction] is a really good place to start ... there actually may be more room to move,"" Harrison said. The experience of Kaiser Permanente, a major health-care system based in California, suggests that Harrison may be correct. In 2009, Kaiser Permanente's Southern California division began an effort to reduce the number of patients who were getting high doses of opioids. That move was launched after a group of doctors in the system noticed that the opioid hydrocodone was the most prescribed medication in Kaiser Permanente's health management organization in Southern California, while another opioid, OxyContin, was also high on that list. ""People [were] getting prescriptions for a thousand pills,"" Dr. Steve Steinberg, a Kaiser physician, told Atlantic.com for a story about Kaiser's program published in March. ""The numbers were so striking that it led us to look into it,"" Steinberg told the news site. Kaiser Permanente has since expanded its opioid prescription initiative to its operations nationally. According to data from Kaiser's Dr. Sameer Awsare that was provided to CNBC, Kaiser Permanente's system nationally reduced opioid prescriptions by 40 percent from December 2014 to this past February. Awsare also said that it has decreased prescription amounts of OxyContin by 75 percent. The health system noted that OxyContin has a high potential for diversion and abuse because brand-name opioids have a higher street value.

548,Christine Wang,8242017,CNBC,8172017,"President Donald Trump has presided over a White House plagued by turnover amid controversy and tumult. His administration has seen a number of high-profile officials leave their posts sooner than expected. To be sure, each exit was preceded by its own set of foreboding signs and circumstances. But the departures are generally heralded by growing reports of warring factions within the Oval Office. Here's a running list of top officials who have left Trump's team, by choice or by force: Trump fired Yates after she directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend his first executive order restricting travel for people from seven majority-Muslim nations. The president slammed Yates, saying she ""betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States."" Yates previously served as deputy attorney general in the Obama administration. She then became acting attorney general, pending the confirmation of Jeff Sessions. Flynn left his role after days of intense scrutiny about his discussions with Russian officials prior to Trump's inauguration. The Washington Post reported that he discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with then-ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yates later testified under oath that she warned the White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. In his resignation letter, the former national security advisor admitted that he inadvertently misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his phone calls with Kislyak. Trump fired Bharara after the prosecutor refused to agree to the Justice Department's demand that he and 45 other U.S. attorneys submit their resignations. While it's not unusual for a new administration to appoint its own federal prosecutors, the holdovers are not typically ousted all at once. Bharara's removal was also unusual because it came months after a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower. After the meeting, the attorney told reporters that the then-president-elect had asked him to stay on in his role. Trump abruptly fired Comey amid multiple investigations into possible ties between his campaign and the Kremlin. The White House initially said Comey was removed on the recommendations of the top two officials in the Justice Department. But Trump later told NBC News that he would have fired the longtime federal agent ""regardless"" of what the department said. The president also said he was considering ""this Russia thing"" when he ousted Comey. Dubke wrote in a note to associates that he originally tendered his resignation on May 18. He said that at that time he offered to remain in the role through the remainder of the president's international trip. Dubke said he left his position for personal reasons. Spicer resigned after opposing the president's appointment of Anthony Scaramucci as communications director. The longtime Republican operative said Trump had asked him to stay in his role. His successor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Spicer left to give the communications team a clean slate. After Dubke's resignation, Spicer had taken over some of the responsibilities of a communications director. Priebus ""formally resigned"" after the president repeatedly pressured him to exert order on a tumultuous White House. His exit came on the heels of Scaramucci's appointment as White House communications director. Despite multiple reports of tension, Scaramucci and Priebus insisted that they were friends. Scaramucci described their relationship as brotherly and that it's expected the two men would ""rough each other up once in awhile."" Many had speculated Priebus would leave the White House after Spicer's resignation. The two worked at the Republican National Committee before joining the Trump administration. The bombastic New York financier exited his post shortly after he unloaded on Priebus and then-chief strategist Steve Bannon in an expletive-laden rant to a New Yorker reporter. Bannon initially submitted his resignation on Aug. 7, a person close to him told The New York Times. The newspaper said the announcement of his departure had been delayed after violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Bannon, a nationalist firebrand, helped shape Trump's populist rhetoric that fueled his rise to the Oval Office. But in the weeks leading up to his exit, reports surfaced of Bannon's influence waning as the president grew increasingly angry with him. Price came under fire after Politico reported he used private jets at taxpayer expense, instead of less-expensive commercial flights. Price's exit came after he said he would reimburse taxpayers for a small fraction of the cost of his flights and vowed to not use charter planes in the future. Price was also reportedly on thin ice with top Trump administration officials who felt he did not do enough to support the last-ditch effort in Congress to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Powell served under national security advisor H.R. McMaster and was considered a close ally of the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Sanders said in a Dec. 8 statement that Powell had always ""planned to serve one year before returning home to New York."" The former Goldman Sachs partner appeared set to depart the administration on good terms. Sanders and Kushner both made statements saying Powell would continue to support the administration's Middle East policy but provided little detail. Powell succeeded K.T. McFarland as deputy national security advisor. Trump nominated McFarland for the role of ambassador to Singapore. Her confirmation process has been held up amid questions about her knowledge of Flynn's conversations with Kislyak. Newman handed in her resignation on Dec. 12 in order to pursue other opportunities, Sanders said in a statement. She had been one of the president's highest-profile African-American, female supporters. McCabe served briefly as acting director of the FBI, between James Comey's ouster and the hiring of current director Christopher Wray. His final year at the agency was fraught with political turmoil — mostly stirred by Trump and his supporters. They have heavily criticized McCabe's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, suggesting bias due to his wife's failed Virginia Senate bid in 2015. She ran as a Democrat and received nearly $700,000 from Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally. McCabe stepped down immediately on Monday, Jan. 29, but will remain on the FBI payroll on ""terminal leave"" until March, when he is eligible to retire with full benefits. He was later fired less than 48 hours before his retirement. Porter, who aided White House chief of staff John Kelly in reviewing documents before they reached Trump's desk, voluntarily resigned shortly after the Daily Mail published allegations of abuse from two former wives. His first wife, Colbie Holderness, told the UK tabloid that Porter had inflicted physical and emotional abuse during their five-year marriage. She said that Porter had punched her in the face during a vacation, and provided a photo of the black eye she allegedly received from the assault. Porter had been urged to ""stay and fight"" by White House officials — including Kelly, Axios reported. In a statement following his resignation on Wednesday, Porter said the allegations ""are simply false,"" and that ""the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described."" Cordish assisted Trump's presidential transition team after the 2016 election through the so-called beachhead team, members of which filled roles prior to the appointment of official administration officials by the Senate. His work on the White House focused on technical innovation and government modernization, though he was perhaps better known as an ally Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. ""Reed has been invaluable to the Administration. His leadership on initiatives ranging from work-force development to Prison Reform to modernizing key VA services will have a positive impact for millions of Americans,"" Kushner told CNBC in a statement. Cordish told the Washington Post that he had not intended to work for the administration for more than a year. The first reports of Hicks' plan to resign came one day after she testified to the House Intelligence Committee about Russian potential involvement with the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. In that hearing, Hicks reportedly said that while she never lied about the Russia probe, she sometimes had to tell white lies as part of the Trump administration. She also reportedly refused to answer a number of questions about her involvement in drafting a misleading initial statement from Donald Trump Jr. regarding a 2016 meeting with Kremlin-connected lawyers in Trump Tower. Hicks had been entangled in White House scandals before she testified to the committee, however. When staff secretary Rob Porter resigned amid allegations that he physically abused his former wives, reports soon emerged that Hicks had begun dating Porter and that she may have helped draft his initial statement denying the allegations. Hicks joined the Trump campaign as a low-level aide before he announced his candidacy and rose through the ranks, eventually taking a leading role in crafting the White House's messaging. Cohn's departure came after Trump said he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. A free trade advocate, Cohn had argued against tariffs in a February meeting with the president and industry executives, according to a person in the room. The former Goldman Sachs president helped shepherd tax overhaul, the administration's only major legislative achievement, which Trump signed into law in December. While Tillerson's resignation came suddenly, his uncomfortable fit in Trump's White House had been a near-constant feature of his tenure. Tillerson had clashed with Trump in private and in public. In July, Tillerson reportedly referred to Trump as a ""moron"" after a White House meeting. And in October, Trump tweeted that Tillerson is ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea on nuclear weapons. Just before he was ousted as secretary of State, Tillerson had cast the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain as part of a ""certain unleashing of activity"" by Russia that the United States is struggling to understand – diverging from the White House's official response. Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil, had no prior public service experience when he accepted the role of America's top diplomat. Tillerson will be replaced by Mike Pompeo, formerly the director of the CIA. Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel will take Pompeo's place as the head of the U.S. intelligence agency — the first woman ever to hold the position. McEntee was fired and reportedly escorted from the White House amid a Secret Service investigation into serious financial crimes. His security clearance has been ""in limbo for some time,"" a federal law enforcement official told NBC News. Shortly after being removed from his position as Trump's personal assistant, McEntee joined the president's 2020 re-election campaign as a senior advisor. While not technically a member of the Trump administration, Dowd worked closely with the White House as Trump's lead lawyer in the special counsel's Russia probe. ""I love the president and wish him well,"" Dowd told NBC News. Dowd had reportedly considered leaving Trump's legal team on multiple occasions, The New York Times reported. The Times, citing two people briefed on the matter, reported that Dowd believed Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice. It was unclear at the time of his resignation who would take over as the leader of Trump's legal team. Days before Dowd's departure, Trump brought Washington lawyer Joseph diGenova aboard the team. McMaster was the second national security advisor to leave the administration in just over one year. The army lieutenant general said in a statement that he is requesting retirement from the Army this summer, after which he will ""leave public service."" Since taking the position, McMaster has faced criticism from some Trump supporters who have attacked him as a ""globalist."" McMaster clashed with Trump when he said that the evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election is ""incontrovertible,"" following indictments against 13 Russian individuals and three Russian entities. Shulkin had been under fire after an internal watchdog report revealed that the VA had improperly approved taxpayers footing the bill for a trip Shulkin's wife took with him to Europe last year. That same report found that Shulkin told a subordinate to handle personal plans for him and his wife during that trip, and that he improperly accepted tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The White House described Gribbin as a key player on the team that assembled Trump's infrastructure plan, which was unveiled in February. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that Gribbin is ""moving on to new opportunities"" now that the plan has been presented to Congress. Top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said Gribbin's ""expertise has added tremendous value to the Adminstration,"" and vowed that the National Economic Council will continue to push to implement the infrastructure plan. Bossert led the administration's efforts on security issues including mainland terrorist threats, cyber defenses and natural disasters, the White House said. As recently as Sunday, he was representing Trump's homeland security policies in television interviews. By Tuesday, however, the White House confirmed Bossert's plan to resign. ""The President is grateful for Tom's commitment to the safety and security of our great country,"" press secretary Sanders said in a statement. ""President Trump thanks him for his patriotic service and wishes him well."" A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNBC that the move ""seems like a natural turnover with a new [National Security Council] director."" John Bolton, a foreign-policy hardliner, started as Trump's national security advisor Monday, replacing H.R. McMaster. Cobb represented the White House in matters related to the special counsel's investigation into the Trump campaign. The New York Times first reported that Cobb was expected to be replaced by Washington lawyer Emmet Flood, whose prior experience includes representing President Bill Clinton in impeachment proceedings. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Cobb's retirement shortly after the newspaper published its story. At the time Trump announced Pruitt's resignation, the embattled EPA secretary was at the center of at least a dozen ethics probes into his spending practices and workplace conduct at the helm of the agency. ""Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this,"" Trump tweeted. Trump tweet Scott Pruitt McGahn had served as the White House counsel since Trump's inauguration and had reportedly been a key player in Trump's ongoing tug-of-war with Mueller. The New York Times reported in August that McGahn had voluntarily submitted to interviews with the special counsel on multiple occasions totaling about 30 hours. McGahn's potential departure had been widely reported for months. Trump, announcing McGahn's departure, said the lawyer would be leaving after the confirmation vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. McGahn has led the administration's push to stock federal courts with young conservative judges. Trump tweet Trump announced Haley's resignation in the Oval Office in early October, saying she would be leaving at the end of 2018. The shock announcement came a few weeks after Trump attended the UN General Assembly in New York City. In remarks to reporters, Trump said that Haley told him months earlier that she wanted to take time off at the end of a one- or two-year period. Trump added that he hoped Haley would come back in a different role, telling her: ""You can have your pick."" Haley, a former South Carolina governor who is considered a rising political star in the GOP, had served in the Trump administration since its early days.

549,Dan Mangan,8242017,CNBC,8172017,"And there was just one. The entire United States, with the exception of a single small county in Ohio, is now on track to have at least one insurer offering Obamacare health coverage next year. That's a big change from earlier this summer when at different times a total of 82 counties lacked commitments from insurers who sell individual health plans for 2018. And the continued decline in ""bare counties"" provides more ammunition for Obamacare advocates arguing against Trump administration claims that the health-care program is failing and needs to be replaced immediately. The latest potential bare area to get coverage offered for next year was Menominee County in Wisconsin, where just 47 people buy Obamacare plans on the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov. Elizabeth Hizmi, a spokeswoman for Wisconsin's insurance commissioner, would not identify the insurer that in recent days agreed to sell plans in Menominee, saying ""at this time, service areas are not public."" Tweet Insurance regulators in Ohio are trying to get an insurer to step in and offer individual health plans in that lone ""bare"" area, Paulding County. ""The director is still working on it,"" said David Hopcraft, spokesman for Ohio Insurance Director Jillian Froment. Paulding County has only 334 people currently covered by an individual health plan sold on HealthCare.gov. Froment has several weeks left to line up an insurer to cover the county. Hopcraft, when asked what provisions Froment was considering for Paulding's existing Obamacare customers if an insurer does not step in, said, ""You know what, we're not there yet."" ""The director said in a recent interview that she was just hopeful,"" Hopcraft said. Ohio had been at risk of having 20 bare counties next year after the big insurer Anthem said in June it was effectively pulling out of the entire state in 2018. But Froment in late July announced that she had obtained commitments from five insurers that would guarantee coverage from at least one insurer in 19 of those counties. Since then, however, Froment has not been able to convince an insurer to cover Paulding County, which sits on the western edge of Ohio, bordering Indiana. ""That's a little bit discouraging,"" said Cynthia Cox, associate director for Kaiser Family Foundation's Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance. ""You would think one insurer would step in from a neighboring county to offer plans,"" Cox said, noting that such an insurer would be guaranteed a monopoly for Obamacare plans. But nationally, Cox said, ""the general trend has been a positive one"" as a steady stream of insurers stepped in to cover Obamacare customers. Cox said that over the course of the last several months 82 counties were at risk of not having an Obamacare insurer selling plans next year. Those counties contained 92,000 current Obamacare customers. The insurer Centene has been, by itself, responsible for offering coverage in more than 40 previously bare counties in 2018, including 25 counties in Missouri. Last week, Centene said it would cover the remaining 14 bare counties in Nevada next year. Despite that current positive trend in covering bare counties, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has continued to push out a negative message about Obamacare overall. HHS's pessimistic tone about the Affordable Care Act began after President Donald Trump took office. Previously, HHS had been Obamacare's biggest cheerleader. Earlier this year, HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began issuing updated maps showing counties that lacked Obamacare insurers for 2018. On Monday, HHS spokesman Matt Lloyd issued a statement that noted the end of a federal Obamacare enrollment assistance program, and said, ""Obamacare failed to create a thriving, competitive market that offers the kind of coverage people want to buy at prices they can afford."" ""On Obamacare's exchanges premiums  continue to surge, insurers  continue to abandon wide swaths of the country, and choices  continue to vanish — an unfortunate reality for the American people who are required to buy Washington-approved health insurance or pay a fine,"" Lloyd said. Lloyd also highlighted an article in the Washington Free Beacon that noted that ""Obamacare's Enrollment Assistance Program spent more than $1,500 for each person it helped enroll last year."" ""By ending this program, which only managed to help 14,500 people sign up for Obamacare — 0.1 percent of total plan selections — CMS is saving taxpayers more than $22 million next year,"" Lloyd wrote. But Protect Our Care, a leading Obamacare advocacy group, on Tuesday cited the news that there remains only one bare county for 2018 to argue against HHS's messaging. ""Republicans keep saying that many people will not have access to health care plans and make discredited claims about a non-existent death spiral,"" Protect Our Care said in a statement. ""The claims have been debunked by the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office and now by the facts in the 2018 coverage map from Kaiser Family Foundation."" Anthem and other insurers that have pulled out of Obamacare markets have cited difficulties in selling individual plans at a profit, as well as uncertainty about the markets because of concern over Trump administration policies, for their decisions. Insurers have expressed fears the administration will not enforce Obamacare's individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have insurance, as well as worries that the administration will not fund key federal payments to insurers to compensate them for discounts offered to a majority of Obamacare customers.

West-Ward Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. division of London-listed Hikma, increased the prices at the start of August by between 75 percent and 430 percent, for a mean of 237 percent, according to figures seen by the Financial Times. In the United States, generic drugmakers such as Hikma are able to dictate prices of their products that have a monopoly or face little competition, the FT said. Among the six drugs, West-Ward is either the only U.S. supplier or one of two manufacturers. The average wholesale price of a 60 ml bottle of liquid Atropine-Diphenoxylate, a common diarrhea drug also known as Lomotil, went from about $16 a bottle to $84, the FT reported. Brian Hoffmann, president of U.S. generics at West-Ward, said the prices of 94 percent of the group's copycat medicine portfolio had either fallen or stayed the same in 2017, and that they had fallen overall this year.

552,"Alexandra Ossola, special to CNBC",8242017,CNBC,8172017,"With the exception of condoms, most forms of non-permanent contraception are under women's control. There's the pill, the patch, the implant, the IUD (hormonal or non-hormonal) and, less popular nowadays, the diaphragm. Now scientists are closer than ever to developing new techniques for male birth control ready for clinical trial. Yet some pharmaceutical companies are concerned a new birth control method for men has the potential to win as much as half the $10 billion market for female contraceptives worldwide and cut into the $3.2 billion of annual condom sales — businesses dominated by pharmaceutical giants Bayer AG, Pfizer and Merck. Nevertheless, scientists are pushing ahead — and the momentum and buzz in the field is reflecting fresh optimism. In the next year or so, researchers hope to start trials in humans using a technique called reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance, which has been under development in India for decades. RISUG works by wedging a thick substance into the vas deferens to prevent sperm from making their way through the pathway to be ejaculated. A few years ago the researchers behind it licensed their technology to an American foundation that used the knowledge to create Vasalgel. Thus far, it has been promising in trials done in rabbits and primates. Another compound, called gendarussa, which is derived from an Indonesian shrub, interrupts the way sperm enter an egg to fertilize it. Clinical trials in Indonesia have found that the compound is highly effective, with few side effects, though larger studies would be needed before the drug could be submitted for approval by the FDA. Throughout the past two decades, researchers have faced some major hurdles; primary among them are side effects and funding. Late last year, researchers published the results of a phase II clinical trial, commissioned by the World Health Organization, that evaluated a two-hormone drug designed to lower sperm count in men. The drug was effective, but the trial ended early because there were too many side effects and the hormone combination didn't work effectively in everyone. In 2012, researchers from the National Institutes of Health tested an injectable contraceptive of two hormones; their results were promising, and they will soon begin testing it in a larger population Other compounds also disrupt the production of sperm, but without hormones. CatSper, for example, can alter the function of sperm so they won't fertilize an egg without disrupting the rest of the man's reproductive system, though this is still in the research stage. JQ1, a compound initially used to block a protein implicated in various forms of cancer, was found to disrupt the production and motility of sperm; an article published last year in MIT Tech Review notes that it has not yet been tested in humans. A researcher at the University of Washington is testing a version of a compound called WIN 18,446, which interferes with the vitamin absorption necessary to make sperm. It was first tried in humans in the 1950s but was found to cause harmful side effects when combined with alcohol, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.

The story behind the new sickle cell drug 25 years in the making Another compound, called H2-gamendazole, prevents sperm from reaching their mature (and thus virile) form. In 2015 the compound was still being tested in animals; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had previously determined that more research was needed to make sure the compound didn't have any additional effects on women's bodies, Wired reports. But to some experts these sorts of chemical interventions are less than ideal. They take a long time to kick in and have more side effects than those that physically block the passage of sperm or interfere with how it fertilizes an egg, says Aaron Hamlin, the executive director of the Male Contraception Initiative, a nonprofit organization working to bring new male contraceptives to market. ""Our organization is not a fan of approaches that stop sperm production. We would rather not take that route because of the inherent delays,"" he says. Despite decades of development, few techniques have moved past initial phases of testing. Pharmaceutical companies have not been interested in developing a male contraceptive beyond what is already on the market. Efforts in the early 2000s from small pharmaceutical companies, such as Organon and Schering, have stalled. A spokesperson from Merck, which acquired Organon's parent company in 2009, says this is not an active area of research or interest. Bayer, which acquired Schering in 2007, reached a similar conclusion: ""Ultimately, the decision was made to halt male contraceptive research, and we currently do not have plans to pursue in the future,"" a spokesperson said via email. Experts have some ideas as to why big pharmaceutical companies might not be interested. According to Kenneth Kaitin, professor and director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, marketing a male contraceptive might be harder than some might think — it would only appeal to men in long-term heterosexual relationships with partners of reproductive age. And since the drug wouldn't be combating a rare, life-threatening illness but would rather serve patients who are already well, pharmaceutical companies would have to make it affordable to the average consumer. All in all, Kaitin says, they probably don't think they would make much money off this kind of drug. ""Getting women to stop taking her drug for a man to start taking his drug, that would take a lot of selling,"" Kaitin says. ""Ultimately, it comes down to capitalism,"" says Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield. And so far that has meant that male contraceptives don't make financial sense. It's also risky. A male contraceptive would serve a population that's already healthy with the goal of preventing pregnancy, for which men don't carry the physical risk. That would mean that regulators would have a very low bar for side effects. And for the intervention to work, it couldn't let even one viable sperm through—it just takes one to get a woman pregnant. But the argument that there's no market for male birth control is deeply flawed. Research has discovered that men, in fact, want more contraceptive options. ""A key aspect is that it gives men the opportunity to be involved in family planning. At the moment, they are excluded from being able to shoulder the burden,"" says Richard Anderson, a professor of clinical reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh. That especially makes sense for heterosexual couples in which the woman can't take birth control for medical reasons, such as a high risk of blood clots. Survey data reflects this openness to male contraceptives. Anderson, along with some collaborators, conducted a survey back in 2000 and found that 83 percent of men from various countries would take a contraceptive. A separate survey found that most women agreed that a male contraceptive was a good idea. The overall market for contraceptives is expected to balloon to $33 billion by 2013, according to another Bloomberg story. Giving consumers more options might not be a bad idea, after all. Smaller companies developing new products and techniques have a big, expensive hurdle between them and the market they hope to serve: clinical trials. No matter how promising these interventions may seem in the lab, clinical trials are needed to test their safety and efficacy before they can be submitted for regulatory approval (indeed, some of the techniques mentioned here are already going through clinical trials, though nothing has made it past the first few stages). But clinical trials are expensive and risky. The later-stage trials, which can involve hundreds or thousands of participants, are often outside the means of small pharmaceutical start-ups. To fund their development and testing, and without backing from big pharma, some small companies are receiving grants from large public health organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (in 2016 the organization doled out $600,000 for development of male contraceptives, according to MIT Tech Review) and the World Health Organization, which has funded several trials for hormonal interventions over the past few decades. Others partner with nonprofits to develop their drugs — the Parsemus Foundation, a nonprofit investigating a number of different drugs, is backing the trials for Vasalgel. As the companies push interventions through the early phase clinical trials, big pharma may get involved, after all. ""Pharmaceutical companies are looking to minimize risk while opening themselves up to large profits,"" Hamlin says. ""[In phase 2 and 3], most of the safety issues have already been parsed out and you can see how these things are working. The level of risk is lower. So pharmaceutical companies may look more seriously [into licensing the technology or acquiring the company]."" Experts were reluctant to predict which intervention would hit the shelves first. ""It's very hard to predict what is going to be the winner that gets to market first,"" Hamlin says. ""So long as we strategically put resources behind good approaches, this is something we can make happen,"" he says.

CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) has had a rough go of it during the past year. Over the last twelve months, shares in the pharmaceutical drug store chain and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) have dipped significantly, falling 19%. Rubbing salt in the wound is the fact that the S&P 500 has increased by 11% over the same time period, meaning CVS Health investors have lost to a basic S&P 500 index fund by 30 percentage points in a year's time. Ouch! The stock price has fallen as the business has struggled, losing important deals to rival Walgreens Boots Alliance and dealing with increasingly hot online competition from Amazon.com, Inc. Last November, CVS CEO Larry Merlo outlined a four-point plan for the company to return to healthy growth. The first step of the plan, as Merlo described it in the S&P Capital IQ transcript of the company's second quarter conference call, was ""leveraging our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans."" Since the plan was implemented, CVS has announced three new partnerships that seem to be of the scale and magnitude necessary to drive growth in the quarters and years ahead. CVS Health hopes its new partnerships can help drive growth. Image source: CVS Health Corp. UnitedHealth Group Inc's (NYSE:UNH) Optum is a health services business that uses technology to deliver integrated solutions. Late last year, CVS announced a new shared pharmacy platform with OptumRx, Optum's PBM, that serves 65 million customers and fills 1 billion prescriptions annually. Under the new platform, the two companies will be able to give employers better value for the health insurance plans they offer to their employees such as allowing OptumRx members fill their prescriptions at CVS locations for the same cost as they can through Optum's home delivery plan. For CVS, the idea is that some of OptumRx's massive customer base will fill their prescriptions at CVS stores, boosting foot traffic and hopefully driving front store sales. The program officially launched this July and, according to Merlo, the company has ""already seen some uptake from clients, and the pipeline of additional opportunity in the coming years is promising."" In June, CVS announced a partnership with Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) in another initiative that CVS hopes will drive traffic to its pharmacy and retail locations. Under this arrangement, Cigna members from self-funded employer-sponsored plans will be able to get discounts on preventive visits to CVS MinuteClinics and CVS Health-branded over-the-counter products. Eligible Cigna customers will also receive Health Tag Messages on their medication's prescription bags which can include anything from doctor instructions to information about Cigna's complementary benefits. As Merlo commented during the conference call, the deal ""leverages the CVS footprint"". Cigna has over 95 million customer relationships around the world, but it was unclear how many of those are eligible for benefits under this arrangement. It might be surprising to see Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) on this list since it is one of CVS Health's chief competitors in the PBM space. That didn't stop Merlo from announcing a new partnership with the company in which CVS will serve as the retail anchor for Express Scripts' diabetes care value program, a performance-based program in which customers must meet certain medical adherence thresholds. Express Scripts also has a massive reach, with over 83 million members filling 1.4 billion prescriptions annually. CVS has an impressive number of assets it can leverage to reach out to new partners and deepen its existing relationships. These assets include over 9,700 retail stores  and 1,100 clinics. The sheer number of locations simultaneously gives CVS the advantage over nearly any other competitor in terms of accessibility and scale, making it an extremely attractive partner for insurance companies and PBMs. If CVS's existing deals drive traffic into the store, lifting front store and pharmacy sales in the process, don't be surprised to see more new deals soon. As Merlo put it in his prepared remarks during the company's second quarter conference call, ""As we look to return to healthy growth, we continue to be very focused on partnering with all payers to drive volumes and capture share, and these conversations have already yielded excellent results."" Management still maintains its long term guidance of 10% EPS growth over time, though the company has not yet given specific projections for next year. Given its projections, its relatively cheap valuation (its P/E ratio is less than 13.5), and its safe (and growing!) dividend, shareholders might want to give management time to see if its turnaround strategy will work. Even if CVS does not meet its own guidance, it seems to be one of the few stocks in the current market with a reasonable valuation and future growth prospects. If these partnerships can even add a little ""oomph"" to the company's top and bottom lines, investors might see market-beating returns for years to come. ","

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is more affably known as Obamacare, is arguably the hallmark legislation of former President Barack Obama. While it's been controversial since its passage, and remains so today, it's hit its primary target, which is to reduce the aggregate number of uninsured people in the United States. Before the implementation of Obamacare, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the uninsured rate was around 16%. Following its implementation, the uninsured dipped to right around 9%. This dramatic cut in the uninsured rate was credited to subsidies that allowed low-income individuals and families the opportunity to afford health insurance, as well as the individual and employer mandates that gave consumers and companies incentive to purchase health insurance, or offer health insurance options to employees. Image source: Obama White House via Flickr. Why are Obamacare premium increases suddenly going parabolic? Three front-and-center factors look to be to blame. The first concern for health insurers is there's a gigantic gray cloud overhanging one of the two critical subsidies for low-income households. Cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) are given to qualifying individuals and families earning between 100% and 250% of the federal poverty level. These subsidies are what help lower the cost of copays, coinsurance, and deductibles associated with going to the doctor or receiving medical care. Put plainly, some 7 million people would probably not be able to afford heading to the doctor without CSRs. Back in 2014, the Republican-controlled House sued Sylvia Burwell, who at the time was the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The reason for the lawsuit was the alleged improper appropriation of CSR funds. The lawsuit argues that only Congress has the authority to appropriate funding for CSRs, which totals around $9 billion to $11 billion annually, but that it hadn't been apportioning this funding. Image source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security via Flickr. In 2016, District of Columbia Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled in favor of the Republicans, but immediately stayed her order with the expectation that the Obama administration would appeal, which it did. That appeal continues to this date, although President Trump has appointed a new Secretary of the HHS, leaving the GOP to essentially continue a lawsuit against itself. President Trump has argued that he would use CSRs as a bargaining chip to get an Obamacare repeal passed in Congress. All Trump would have to do is drop the appeal of Collyer's verdict, and CSR funding would cease. Health insurers, not knowing what'll happen to this lower-margin but guaranteed income source known as CSRs, have been raising premiums to account for this uncertainty. Presumably, higher premiums will take into account those who receive care but are unable to pay their fair share of costs. A second reason Obamacare enrollees should expect to see their premiums skyrocketing in 2018 is that the Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) isn't working. The SRP is the penalty individuals are supposed to pay for not purchasing health insurance. It's the financial incentive that's designed to give holdouts a forceful nudge into buying insurance. However, there's a very wide gap between the actual cost of the penalty for not buying health insurance, and the average premium cost for a full year of coverage. Image source: Getty Images. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the average household SRP for not purchasing health insurance in 2016 would be $969. For added context, the SRP in 2016 was the greater of $695 or 2.5% of modified adjusted gross income. Comparatively, HealthPocket notes that in 2017, the average unsubsidized bronze-tier premium, the cheapest tier of plans, cost a little more than $3,700 annually ($311 a month). Do the math: $969 versus $3,700. Of course healthy people are going to stay on the sidelines, because they'll save about $2,700. The reason this is such a big deal is that the SRP was designed to coerce healthy young adults to enroll. Healthy adults visit the doctor less, meaning their premium dollars are crucial to offsetting the higher costs of treating sicker patients. This last point is of particular importance, since Obamacare opened the gates and denied insurers the ability to turn away members with pre-existing conditions. In other words, insurers have been saddled with an influx of sicker patients, while the addition of healthy patients has been tepid, at best. Insurers need to ensure that they can continue to operate profitability, and one way to do so with an unfavorable mix of patents is to increase premium prices. The final factor sort of builds on the first two issues: Insurers aren't sticking around to see what happens. This year, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest insurer in the country, slashed its coverage down to just three states from the 34 it had been operating in back in 2016. Similarly, Aetna (NYSE:AET) and Humana (NYSE:HUM), which regulators denied the right to merge, chose to cut their county-based coverage by almost 70% and nearly 90%, respectively, in 2017. Those cuts are expected to steepen as we head into 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Back in mid-February, Humana announced that it would be pulling out of Obamacare's marketplace exchanges altogether in 2018, with Aetna following suit in May. Anthem (NYSE:ANTM), which is the second largest national insurer behind UnitedHealth Group, and a company that was expected to benefit greatly from the expansion of Medicaid, has announced that it'll also be pulling out of a number of markets next year. In addition, the failure of the risk corridor -- a fund designed to prop up money-losing insurers that priced their premiums too low -- wound up forcing the closure of most of Obamacare's 23 approved healthcare cooperatives. That means a lack of low-cost premium options for consumers. Add this together, and we have what looks to be an environment with minimal competition, and therefore strong pricing power for those that remain. Avalere has estimated that 41% of all U.S. counties next year will have just one insurer offering plans. That's a recipe for high premiums. With President Trump eager to see Obamacare repealed and replaced, it's unclear what the long-term holds for the program. However, the near-term dynamics pretty clearly suggest that marketplace customers are going to have to spend a lot more for coverage in the coming year. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Colon cancer claims more than 50,000 American lives each year, which makes it the country's second-deadliest type of cancer. That's doubly tragic because colon cancer is generally highly treatable if found in its earliest stages. Sadly, it's often not diagnosed until the later stages, where treatment options are limited. Image source: EXACT Sciences presentation Exact Sciences is on a mission to fix this problem. It developed an innovative, non-invasive screening tool that was easy for patients to use: Cologuard, a simple stool collection kit that is shipped directly to the patient's home. To use the test, a patient simply orders the kit, deposits a stool sample, and sends it back to Exact Sciences for analysis. The company analyzes the sample using its proprietary testing technology and then sends the results directly to the patient's doctor for follow up. Image source: Exact Sciences. As you can imagine, the simplicity and privacy provided by Cologuard are highly attractive to patients. Furthermore, health care providers can feel good about recommending the test since a 10,000 patient clinical study showed that Cologuard correctly identified the presence of colon cancer 92% of the time. EXAS data by YCharts Despite Cologuard's benefits and its clear potential to save lives, the product and company still had a fair number of detractors. Bears argued (correctly) that Cologuard was not as accurate as a colonoscopy at detecting cancer, and noted that it has a relatively high false-positive rate. That argument was reinforced in late 2015 when the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force suggested that Cologuard should be used as an ""alternative screening test"" for colon cancer instead of a ""recommended"" test. The news raised concerns that insurers would push back hard against covering it. Furthermore, Exact Sciences' own data showed that about a third of the kits it shipped off to patients were never sent back to the company. That's not great news, since the company can't bill for its services until it gets the kit back and tests the sample. These factors combined with the company's long history of losses and a huge short position to turn the 20-month period following Cologuard's launch into a brutal time for shareholders. EXAS data by YCharts In an effort to turn its fortunes around, Exact Sciences decided to go on the offensive and spent big on a national advertising campaign. The company also focused more effort on reaching out to non-compliant patients to persuade them to send their tests back for analysis. While this move was costly and bold, recent results clearly show the strategy is paying off. Last quarter, Exact Sciences announced that it completed 135,000 Cologuard tests, up 149% year over year. That impressive performance allowed management to up its testing guidance for the year to at least 550,000 -- a big jump from its prior outlook of 470,000. The company has also made a lot of progress with getting insurers on board. Management recently announced contract wins with UnitedHealth Group and Aetna. With these contracts in place, the company now believes that 86% of its target patient population now has reimbursement access to the test. Thankfully, this surging testing volume is translating into improving financial results, too. The company's top line jumped by 172% last quarter to $57.6 million. The increased sales leverage is also leading to margin gains and lower-than-expected losses. In turn, the shorts have been squeezed out of Exact Sciences' stock, which has help to propel the fantastic year-to-date results. EXAS data by YCharts The surging stock price also enabled Exact Sciences to complete a secondary offering on favorable terms. Its cash balance now sits at more than $484 million, which should provide it with plenty of firepower to continue to invest in the business. Even with an enormous surge in testing volume in the rear-view mirror, there are ample reasons to believe that the company's growth engine is just getting started. Management estimates that it has only reached about 2% of its current addressable market. The company also has plans to develop similar tests that will work on detecting pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancers. Success in any of those other indications would meaningfully expand the company's addressable market opportunity. Despite those negatives, I happen to think that that the company's massive market opportunity and recent execution excellence justify a small investment today. However, those who agree with me and are willing to pay today's obscene valuation multiples to get in should mentally prepare themselves for a bumpy ride ahead. ","

A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: My fingers are tired from writing ""I'm sorry, mea culpa!"" in preparation for today's episode. [laughs] Campbell: No. I think any investor that's been investing for a while recognizes that mistakes are common, and they can be wonderful teaching moments, so let's keep that in mind as we go through. Harjes: Exactly. So, we'll have a clip where I said something that was wrong, and then for the second half of the show, we'll go over to one that Todd picked out for a prediction of his that was not quite on the target. To kick things off, here's a clip from our Oct. 28, 2015, show. This show was called ""Walgreens Shows Its Hand, Scoops Up Rite Aid."" So that was my speculation. For some context, the original deal that we were talking about was for $9.7 billion. It was announced in October of 2015 that Walgreens would acquire Rite Aid for $9 a share. That was later revised down to about $6.50-$7. It all depended on how many stores were divested. For some additional context here, these are the two major retail pharmacy players in the United States, and therefore the FTC did not want the type of power consolidation that could be involved with this deal. That's why there was the first revision of the plan. And eventually, we found out in June 29 of this year that the entire deal had fallen through, and the original FTC decision had been scheduled for July 7, but Walgreens ended up saying, ""You know, they're just not going to approve this, so we're going to offer up a new deal to acquire just about half of Rite Aid's stores,"" which is a heck of a lot smaller than the original deal. And that's where we stand now. We had more details about this new version of the deal on the episode that we did on July 5, but there's no getting around the fact that back in October of 2015, I was just totally off the mark saying the FTC would let this deal go through. Campbell: You were just hopeful! You were hopeful! There's nothing wrong with hopeful. Yes, you were optimistic. As investors, we sometimes get optimistic, and we connected some dots, and the dots were, with the push to try and drive down prices, maybe they would let this go through. The reality is, however, there's no denying that the pharmacy marketplace has gotten very consolidated since 2000. You've got a handful of players who dominate that market. You have Walgreens, you've got CVS, and you've got Rite Aid. So, combining Walgreens and Rite Aid together, OK, yeah, that would have created a behemoth in the space, and theoretically, that could have eliminated competition in certain local markets to the point where they weren't going to get this deal approved. Shares of Rite Aid, Kristine, have been absolutely pummeled on the news of the new revised deal. Harjes: Yeah, they fell 26%. Campbell: I'm curious to put you on the spot again for next year's episode -- Harjes: Oh, great! [laughs] Campbell: -- and see if you have any thoughts for Rite Aid from here. Will this deal get through? Harjes: Yeah, I'm really hesitant to speculate again on it. But it's really hard not to do, because watching what has happened to Rite Aid's shares over the past 22 months -- I think that's the right number -- since Walgreens started talking to the FTC about potentially scooping up some or all of Rite Aid, it is fascinating. Rite Aid's shares are down to about one-third of the level they were before this deal was ever announced. They're down 73% just since the beginning of this year. Right now, they're hovering around $2.25 a share. If you recall, the original deal was for $9 per Rite Aid share, so the market has just completely crippled Rite Aid. Campbell: Kristine, just to jump in for one quick second because I don't want to forget this point, what's interesting to think about, in that original deal, if you include debt, that deal was worth over $17 billion. So Walgreens was willing to pay, including debts, $17 billion to get its hands on Rite Aid. Now, what's Rite Aid's market cap today? Harjes: $2.34 billion. Campbell: $2.34 billion, and they still have half their stores, and they still have their pharmacy benefit manager. So I wonder if there's a little bit of a disconnect. Maybe that's the uncertainty. The uncertainty is, we don't know whether or not the deal will close, and if it doesn't close, you still have Rite Aid as a relatively troubled and highly indebted company. Harjes: Yeah, they have $7.2 billion in debt. I think, actually, I have learned from being wrong the first time about this, because I'm so intrigued by Rite Aid as a value play right now, but I haven't bought any shares, and I think that actually is the hesitation of, I was wrong about whether or not the FTC would let this go through once. I could be wrong again, even though right now, sitting here looking at it, I'm going to say, I do think this will go through. And even if not, I think Rite Aid is grossly undervalued. But that being said, I still haven't put my money behind it, because I'm looking at this like, well, I understood the situation incorrectly the first time around, so I'm going to try to learn from that and say deals are not done deals until they go through. It's dangerous to try to grab an arbitrage opportunity, especially because if you look at what happens when these deals fall through, the stocks are absolutely crushed. And while it doesn't look like to me that Rite Aid has farther that it could really fall based on the value of the business alone, it could. And who am I to say that won't? Campbell: Right. Is this a falling knife or a value trap? Or is this truly a bargain-bin buy? That's the big question. I had a mentor back in the '90s, Kristine, and one of the things that I learned from that mentor was, don't worry too much about the bottom 10% of a move or the top 10% of a move. Focus your attention on that 80% in the middle. So I think investors should basically take a step back and say, ""I don't need to be perfect in timing my entry and trying to get to the bottom. Why don't I let this play out a little bit, because it's likely that if it does close, there will be opportunities for me to benefit and make that 80% of the move after, rather than trying to be a hero and stepping up into the uncertainty?"" Harjes: Yeah, I think that's great advice. For investors looking to do that here, take a look at the value of the stores. Consider that Walgreens will be able to cherry-pick the ones that it wants. Also consider that the way in which it will cherry-pick them will have a lot to do with what the FTC says it's allowed to choose as far as the geographical footprint goes. Also, look at its PBM. Rite Aid has EnvisionRx, its pharmacy benefits manager. That's a whole other part of this business that doesn't really get talked about a lot, and I suspect the value of that isn't really being considered in the full market cap of this company. Campbell: Yeah, Kristine, just to jump in again on that point, because it's a good one, I crunched some numbers on that not that long ago in an article I posted on The Motley Fool, and one of the conclusions I came to is, as a standalone company, that EnvisionRx could be worth anywhere between $2.4 and $4 billion on its own, which is intriguing. Harjes: Interesting. Yeah, I don't think I read that one yet, so I will definitely go ahead to the site and look for it. If anyone listening wants to read it, shoot us an email at industryfocus@fool.com, and I will dig it up and send it along for you. Todd, I'm going to take myself out of the mistakes spotlight and pivot over to you. In our July 27, 2016, show, we talked about CEOs that were enormously successful in one business venture who were back at it trying to catch lightning in a bottle again. We featured Tesaro, NantKwest, Puma Biotech, and OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK). And in an effort to put you on the spot, or give our readers a tidy conclusion, I asked you to pick your favorite. Here's a refresher of what you said: Harjes: Any thoughts on that? Campbell: I could have picked Tesaro's Lonnie Moulder. Tesaro got an approval for their PARP inhibitor, and sure enough, its shares have gone from $95 to a high of $180 and still trading around $120. That would have worked. I could have picked Puma. It got its approval of Nerlynx recently, and its shares have gone from $49 to $80. But no, [laughs] I settled with the safe play, going with Phillip Frost, OPKO Health. And sure enough, its shares have been flushed down the toilet bowl, falling from $10 to about $6, which is even more painful when you think about the fact that this has been one of the strongest periods for market returns in recent memory. Harjes: So. [laughs] What did you learn from this? Campbell: There were reasons that I sided with and picked Phillip Frost. Phillip Frost is a proven leader. And I love investing in companies with proven leaders. Rome wasn't built in a day. Phillip Frost has been starting, successfully, running companies, and then selling them since the 1970s, and he's one of the wealthiest healthcare entrepreneurs in America. So I think sidling up next to him was not necessarily a mistake long-term, but certainly a mistake short-term. And I think the short-term mistake I made was to fail to understand how much shares could fall if a couple of key catalysts were either slow to develop or outright disappointed. Do you me want to walk through those catalysts, Kristine? Harjes: Yeah, there's been a handful of them over the last year or so since we talked about this. Do you want to start with maybe the slow launch of Rayaldee? Campbell: Yeah. Rayaldee is a very intriguing drug, because it's a prohormone for vitamin D that works better than existing vitamin D supplements that are given to patients with chronic kidney disease, that suffer from vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency can cause calcium loss in bones, bone weakness, and all sorts of other problems. So it's an important indication; it's important to have treatment options available for it. The problem is, after Rayaldee launched, it did not have widespread early-on inclusion in drug formularies at insurers. So the patient population that was covered by insurers that would pay for these drugs was pretty small, and sales, frankly, have been a rounding error and aren't even broken out in OPKO Health's quarterly results yet. Perhaps, according to Phillip Frost in the second-quarter conference call, they'll start to break those numbers out for us in the fourth quarter of this year. And there's opportunities there theoretically for Rayaldee to finally deliver on its promise. But Rayaldee wasn't the only disappointment. You also had Varubi, which is a drug that's approved for use in patients who are suffering from vomiting and nausea after receiving chemotherapy. That's a very important market. It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and Varubi is licensed by Tesaro, which is Lonnie Moulder's company. So far, sales have been slow to grow. Sales in the second quarter were only about $2.9 million, and with OPKO collecting double-digit royalties, again, a rounding error considering that the company is doing $300 million roughly in quarterly revenue because of its diagnostics business. Harjes: And that wasn't even the only disappointment. Campbell: Yeah. They also came up shy in a very important trial that was evaluating the long-lasting human growth hormone treatment in adults. They have a drug that's partnered up with Pfizer. A lot of people thought that if this drug reached the market and eventually got approved for use in kids, pediatric use, then this could be a big moneymaker for OPKO Health. Unfortunately, in December, they announced that the trial missed its mark. They haven't given up on the drug, but that trial was a failure. So overall, you have this confluence of disappointments over the course of the last 12 months that has really taken a toll on the company's stock price. You add that together with the fact that sales in the diagnostic business, which is basically the specialty lab that they run, have pretty much flatlined at around $300 million, a little over $300 million, there hasn't been a lot of excitement or enthusiasm to drive up the market cap of this company. Harjes: So, clearly, it's been a disappointing year for OPKO shareholders. Where do you stand now going forward on it, Todd? Do you think it's, ""Looking back on it, I was wrong, this is a terrible company, investors should stay far away from it,"" or do you think that now, at the lower share price, there might be an even better opportunity for investors to scoop up some shares at a discounted price, because now, going forward, is where the real promise is? Or something in between the two? Campbell: There's a couple different takeaways I guess I have on this whole thing. I think, yes, you stick with proven leaders, and yes, there's a lot of opportunity still ahead for OPKO. I don't like buying drug-development stocks on sale as using the value argument only because, as we saw last year, a lot can happen with clinical trials. You can say, ""There's all sorts of opportunities still in the pipeline,"" which there is, drugs that could rack up lots of sales for this company over time. But those trials could fail. You have to take a look at it and say, ""I'm not going to buy it solely because it's cheap relative to where it was last year. Things happened that the outlook now has changed."" But I think you can look at it and say, Rayaldee could still deliver on the goods. We'll know better early next year what the sales trend, the prescription trend is for that. Varubi, which again is marketed by Tesaro, there's a PDUFA date at the FDA that could approve an IV formulation. If that formulation gets approved, that opens up the vast majority of the marketplace for this type or this class of drugs. That, theoretically, could start meaningfully generating revenue in 2018. And there's a pediatric study ongoing in human growth hormone still that reads out in 2019. If that trial is good, then Pfizer and OPKO will split the profits on both OPKO's drug and Pfizer's existing drug in that indication, Genotropin, which is selling at a clip of over $100 million per quarter. So there's still reasons besides value that you'd want to own OPKO Health. And certainly, Phillip Frost remains incredibly committed as a shareholder in this company. He continues and has continued to increase the number of shares he owns over the past year, even in the face of all these disappointments. Harjes: Some of the dates that you mentioned when you were running down your list of catalysts going forward are pretty far in the future. That speaks to me about a bigger problem with investing in biotech, which is opportunity cost. Many of the stocks that look interesting today are likely to take a long time before they prove out. Something that regular listeners of the show have heard us talk about before is keeping an investing journal. That's so important, so I'm going to say it again -- keep an investing journal, specifically to combat this type of mistake, or looking at the mistake incorrectly when maybe it wasn't quite a mistake yet, is to write down exactly the dates that you're looking for. So the PDUFA dates, when the FDA might approve a drug, or a forecast for when you think a company is finally going to turn profitable, things like that where, if it's a date that's relevant to your investment thesis, you want to have it written down in front of you, so that when that date comes and goes you can reevaluate your thinking and figure out if, indeed, you were right. If, for example, your investing thesis for OPKO had something to do with a PDUFA date that's years and years out, you want to know that and you want to be very aware of it for several reasons, one of which is that, maybe it's not really the time to invest just yet. Maybe there are better places for your money now where you can get more validation sooner that you actually are placing your money in the proper place. Of course, we are long-term investors here at The Fool, but in the short term, if you're going to look at a company that is declining over the course of one year and think, ""Oh my gosh, I was wrong, I need to exit,"" but you're still waiting for a catalyst that's years in the future, then you're going to end up cutting yourself short, and you'll never even see the potential gains that you were hoping to get in the very beginning. Campbell: That's a great point, Kristine. I'm going to throw another point out there, too. We've talked about on the show previously, especially in biotech, diversify, diversify, diversify. I selected one stock out of these four -- Harjes: To be fair, I made you do that. Campbell: Yeah. Well, that exposed us to a lot more risk. If we had just invested across all four of them, you would have done very well, because of the success that we saw with Puma and Tesaro. So, I think diversification is always something that's very important across this space. Never put all your eggs in one basket hoping that you're going to hit a home run. Harjes: Yeah. And it's important not to beat yourself up too much about single mistakes, because overall, if you're right 50% of the time, you're a really, really good stock picker. Campbell: Very good stock picker, and you'd be a great baseball player. Harjes: Yeah, exactly! So, Todd, I'm not going to beat you up too much about the OPKO mistake, and I'll try not to beat myself up too much about getting the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger information predicted incorrectly. And that'll do it. Hopefully we can learn from these mistakes and move forward and be right at least 50% of the time, hopefully more! As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. This show is produced by Austin Morgan. For Todd Campbell, I'm Kristine Harjes. Thanks for listening and Fool on! ","
      
    Boy, Were We Wrong About Rite Aid and Opko Health -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9999
559,Todd Campbell,8242017,Fool,8172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It may not get the attention as often as larger-cap biotech stocks like Celgene Corp. (NASDAQ:CELG) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), but a bunch of recent drug approvals could soon change that for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN). Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals about to reward investors with a steady stream of big-time sales and profit growth? A full transcript follows the video. Todd Campbell: It was great! I don't know if, when you travel, you're always looking for investment ideas. I always am. No matter what I'm doing, when I'm traveling, or if I'm going to the dentist, or whatever, I'm trying to figure out if there's an investing angle. And I have one for you, Kristine. Harjes: OK, let's hear it. Campbell: Go long Wellfleet oysters. Oh my God, they're so delicious. Harjes: Is that an actual company? Campbell: No. [laughs] But they are delicious oysters. Harjes: [laughs] Maybe someday they'll go public, and then we can make all of the riches. Campbell: There we go! Campbell: Kristine, I'm wicked excited to talk about this company. Harjes: Wicked excited, that's such a Northeast thing to say. Campbell: I'm using the New England wicked. Because, again, you hit on, we talk a lot about companies like Celgene, one of my favorite stocks out there. But Regeneron is a very interesting stock. It's a little bit smaller than those three upper echelon players -- Gilead, Amgen, and Celgene. It has a $50 billion market cap instead of $100 billion market cap. But there are reasons to think this company could take that next step higher and become part of that commonly discussed group on this show and elsewhere. I thought it would be a lot of fun to dive in and talk about the different things that are going on at the company, because there's a tremendous amount of research and development activity going on at the company. Again, it's a big company. This is a substantial, investable idea that we can talk to our listeners about. They have 5,400 employees, a $50 billion market cap. They did almost $5 billion in revenue last year. They're profitable, and they make a lot of money. So I'm looking forward to it. Harjes: Yeah, this is definitely not one of your tiny pre-clinical stocks that we sometimes talk about on this show, but rather an established player that is clawing its way up to be at the top of the hill of biotechs. This is a company that, for a long, long time, was known for just one drug called Eylea. This is their flagship product, which was first approved in 2011 for various retinal diseases. They're just recently, within the past few years or so, starting to branch out and diversify into other drugs. They now have a handful of approved drugs and an incredibly deep pipeline. But let's start at the beginning and talk a little bit about Eylea. Campbell: Kristine, I think one of the listeners' favorite shows based on responses that we got in the past has been the catching-lightning-in-a-bottle type shows, where we've highlighted CEOs that have successfully developed drugs and then sold their companies and are now trying to do it again. I think we should really give a shout out to two proven leaders, CEOs at companies that don't leave and start over, but still catch lightning in a bottle over and over and over again at the companies that they stay at. And one of those leaders is Regeneron's CEO, Leonard Schleifer, who has proven that he's developed a very good model for discovering, developing, and now winning FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval of drugs across a few different indications. You mentioned Eylea being the No. 1 drug, the most important drug right now for the company, in terms of revenue and everything else. But they've actually had six different drugs that they've found internally that have made it through the FDA gauntlet and have made it to market -- four of those being significant drugs, which I define as drugs that either already have $1 billion in sales, Eylea, or could end up having $1 billion in sales, which would be these three more recently discovered drugs: Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara. Harjes: Yes. Looking at these drugs, as you mentioned, a lot of them do have the potential to eventually hit that blockbuster status. But I think it's also important to look at Eylea and its own growth, because this is a pretty established drug that has been bringing in a lot of revenue for Regeneron for quite a while, but it's still growing fairly quickly. Sales in the U.S. were up 11% year over year. Regeneron just reported its earnings on August 3 -- we're talking about the second quarter here. In that quarter, it sold nearly a billion, just in the quarter alone. This is at nearly a $4 billion run rate just with U.S. sales. It's important to note that Regeneron receives just a share of profit from ex-U.S. sales because it's partnered with Bayer on this drug. Campbell: Right. Bayer and Regeneron are working together on commercializing the drug globally. This is a monster drug in a huge indication. I think you mentioned briefly that it's approved to treat wet stage age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. These are two increasingly common causes of vision loss within older patients. If you think about this for a second, what's the argument for the growth that you're referencing? You've got 76 million baby boomers, and they're turning 65 at a pace of 10,000 people per day. The incidence of these two indications within this patient population, as they're getting older and living longer, is increasing. What's really intriguing about Eylea and its success, this is a drug that did $1.5 billion in global sales last quarter alone. So, it has a $6 billion global run rate. That growth has come not because of price increases, but because it's being more increasingly used -- more patients are being diagnosed with these conditions, and then some market-share wins. There's other players. We'll talk about the competition, because I think that's important, too. I think this is an important drug. It's likely to remain an important drug for the company, especially given the fact that they have patent protection on the drug that stretches out into the 2020s. Harjes: Right. When you look at the indications that it is approved for, you can see the demographic trends hidden in the name of the diseases. You have wet age-related macular degeneration, wet AMD, it's age related. As you mentioned, that's a huge growing population. Its other approved indication is diabetic macular edema. This is a diabetic condition, and the population of diabetics is also something that is growing. It's also approved for diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. You can see exactly why this drug will continue to grow. You mentioned that it does have some competition. It's competing with a drug called Lucentis. There could potentially be some biosimilars to Lucentis, which are copycat versions of it that could be a little bit cheaper once the Lucentis patent expires in 2020. There's also an interesting competition going on between Lucentis and Eylea and Roche's drug called Avastin, which is a cancer drug that's being used off-label in this indication because it's so much cheaper. Campbell: Yeah, it's way cheaper, and as a result, its market share is, I want to say it's 30%-40% in wet AMD. Harjes: It's interesting. For me, it's one of the most high-profile times that we see an off-label drug being used across an indication with any sort of huge reach. Harjes: Yeah. This is a company that recognizes it has a really strong foothold in retinal diseases. It knows how important Eylea is to it, but it also knows that it needs to diversify. It reminds me of a lot of other companies in this regard. For example, let's compare it to Gilead Sciences. This would be like Gilead Sciences saying, ""We know HIV is super important. That's been the foundation of our business,"" and I'm talking a couple years ago now. At that point, they said, ""We need to do something other than HIV, as well, to continue having new growth drivers."" And still today, you see Gilead branching out into new indications and trying to find that next step, what's going to drive future growth. Campbell: Yeah. Similar to Celgene, right Kristine? You talk about Revlimid, $8 billion in sales from Revlimid, and they're spreading out into some other indications, too. You're right, it's very important for these companies to be expanding. And Regeneron is doing it. Harjes: Yeah, it's a story that you see a lot. When you think about the life cycle of biotechs, they often do strike it big with one indication or one drug, and then they're established and they have cash flow coming in and they need to use it to fund clinical development to keep that growth moving and keep investors satisfied. We've talked a whole ton about Eylea, and don't get me wrong, that's a very important component of Regeneron. But we think it's even more exciting to discuss what else Regeneron has going on, both in its product portfolio and in its pipeline. Campbell: There are so many moving pieces to this company since 2015. It's really important for investors who are interested in buying Regeneron to understand both the positives, what the market opportunity could be for its newest drugs, but also some of the risks and the challenges that are facing these drugs. I think a great place to start, Kristine, would be to look at Praluent, which is the first of the three most recently launched drugs. That won approval in summer of 2015 for use in treating bad cholesterol -- high bad cholesterol -- in patients in which it was genetically caused. A pretty tough-to-treat indication. That drug launched with these multi-billion-dollar blockbuster expectations, but it's been a little bit disappointing. It's still selling pretty well, but it's nowhere near what those expectations were. Harjes: Right. Praluent is what's known as a PCSK9 inhibitor. We've talked about them on the show before. It's a drug that works to lower your cholesterol levels in a novel way. When you consider how many Americans take drugs for cholesterol levels, you would think this would be a huge success. The problem is, it's pretty expensive. This drug is $14,000 a year. You compare that to drugs like statins, which are not under patent protection anymore, the generics are pretty darn cheap, especially compared to $14,000 annually. So this drug is really not doing as great as people were expecting. It saw sales of just $46 million in the past quarter, and that was up from $26 million from the quarter of a year ago, so Q2 2016. But still, these numbers are really tiny for a drug that was supposed to be a billion-dollar blockbuster. Campbell: Yeah. I think a lot of investors were disappointed by that. That's one of the reasons why Regeneron shares underperformed in 2016. But I think they're looking forward now and they're saying, Praluent sales are up pretty substantial year over year. We're now at about a $200 million a year run rate. That's solid. And there is a big Phase III study that's wrapping up at the end of this year. With data coming out early 2018, they could move the needle and make this drug more commonly used, too, and that's an outcome study that's evaluating whether or not using Praluent actually reduces the likelihood of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes. Harjes: Which, that data is pretty darn important if you are a payer looking at whether or not a $14,000 price tag is worth it. You might want to know, is this actually going to lower the risk of a cardiovascular event? So there's 18,000 patients in this study, and we should be getting data in early 2018. That could swing things in a positive direction for this company. Let's also look at one big threat to this drug and to Regeneron -- which is the ongoing legal battle that they have with Amgen and its competing drug, Repatha. Campbell: [Dun-dun-dun.] It's not all roses and fairy tales over here. We do have a big risk, a big challenge that investors have to be aware of when it comes to this drug. And that's that Amgen has sued Regeneron and Sanofi, its partner on the drug, for patent infringement. So far, the courts have been siding with Amgen on it. As a matter of fact, previously, the courts actually said that Sanofi and Regeneron would have to stop selling Praluent in the United States. That was stayed pending appeal, which is why you're still seeing this drug on the market racking up revenue. But depending on how this all shakes out, you could run all sorts of different scenarios. You could say, Amgen ends up winning in the appeal, and as a result, Praluent disappears from the marketplace along with its $200 million in annualized sales. You could say, Amgen wins, and they cut a deal to share royalty streams somehow with Praluent sales. Or you could say, Regeneron comes out on top and Praluent continues as is, the outcome study comes out aces, and the next thing you know, you have a billion-dollar blockbuster on your hands. Harjes: Right. As with many legal matters, outcome hazy, we'll see what happens with that. But what you need to take away from this is that Praluent has, thus far at least, not lived up to the hype. But fortunately, that was not the only drug that Regeneron was developing to diversify away from Eylea. It was able to launch a drug recently called Dupixent, which is now approved for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Campbell: This is a really intriguing drug, and it may even have a bigger commercial opportunity than Praluent does. Moderate-to-severe eczema is very difficult to treat. There's not a lot of treatment options out there. The drug costs $37,000 annually, which sounds like a lot of money, but it's actually not that bad. The payers and insurers basically applauded that price tag when it was announced. The market for Dupixent could be multiple billions of dollars in a year, taken with a grain of salt because we know, as we've seen in the past, peak sales estimates oftentimes fall short. But I have seen people out there saying that if other studies that are evaluating Dupixent in asthma, for example, results coming soon, stay tuned, potential approval application getting filed by the end of this year. You could see this drug generate about $4 billion in annual sales by 2023. Now, I think that's a stretch. But I think what you can look at this drug and say, with its current indication, and with the potential in asthma, and the potential to be used in more patients over time, this absolutely could be a significant driver of sales. And Sanofi and Regeneron will split any profit on it. Harjes: Despite the little bit of skepticism there is about whether or not this drug will be able to outperform drugs like Novartis' Cosentyx, there's also competition from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline, it's definitely not a market that they have to themselves. This kind of has become the favorite child after Praluent was so disappointing. So, lots of excitement going on around this drug, particularly seeing how it launches in its currently approved indications, as well as how it performs in some of the currently ongoing trials that you mentioned, Todd. Campbell: Kristine, just to interject before we jump to the next one, Q2 sales of the drug, first quarter on the market, $28 million. So better than a $100 million run rate right out of the gate. Harjes: Yeah, that's not bad. It's pretty hard to project future sales based on the first quarter on the market, but that's definitely a good sign that payers are accepting the price tag and doctors are prescribing the drug. Off to a good start, and definitely something to keep an eye on. Oh, one more detail before we move on to the next drug: Amgen is also battling over this patent. Which is kind of interesting, because Amgen doesn't even have a rival drug here. They don't even have something in the pipeline, which also means that they can't ask for an injunction that would pull the drug from the market. Amgen is just looking for money here. It's like they're a consistent thorn in the side of Regeneron. Anyway, moving on to the next drug that we wanted to highlight, this one is called Kevzara, and it treats moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, which is another enormous indication. Campbell: Yeah, a multi-billion-dollar indication with a lot of players, dominated by anti-TNF drugs like Humira, which listeners will probably remember. Humira is the biggest-selling drug on the planet, with about $16 billion in annual sales. Kevzara is not going to be that big. It's going to be more of a niche player, because its approval is for use in patients who have tried and failed on other therapies like DMARDs and Humira and the like. However, a $39,000 annual price tag is cheaper than Humira, and that has some people thinking that Kevzara could win away sales in this indication. Again, grain-of-salt warning. Peak sales estimates could be $1 billion for the drug over time. We'll have to see, though, because again, this is a competitive marketplace, and I'm not entirely sure just how much of this market they'll end up winning. Harjes: One key question to keep an eye out for is whether doctors will eventually be able to, or want to, prescribe this as a first-line treatment. For context, they actually did test this against Humira in trials and showed that the two had similar safety. That should be really important in making the case to prescribing doctors that you might want to just try Kevzara right away. But for now, that's not going to be the case. Humira is extremely well established. There are plenty of other drugs that are established in the space. I think you're right that, for now, it will be a niche, later-line drug. Campbell: Yeah. I think you watch it over the course of the next few quarters, you see what the prescription trends look like in the quarterly reports. All of these companies, as listeners should know, they talk about their performance every quarter, you can see the transcripts online, you can go through and read them after they have their discussions. Oftentimes, they'll talk about market share, they'll talk about prescription trends, they'll talk about how these drugs are doing. I think if you evaluate this one over the course of the next three or four quarters, you'll get a feel for whether or not this is going to be a drug that does $200 million a year in sales, or potentially could do much more than that. But it's still going to be a fairly substantial drug, because think about it -- when you start poo-pooing drugs that may only do nine figures in sales, you know you're talking about a pretty strong company. Harjes: Yeah, exactly. But that's not all. They also have a humongous pipeline. We just walked you through the product portfolio -- things that are approved. But the pipeline also has 17 more product candidates in it. Five of them are in Phase III trials. Some of these are label extensions for the drugs we just talked about. For example, Todd, you mentioned earlier extending the label of Eylea. I think you also mentioned Dupixent in asthma that's going on. They're also looking at Praluent in hypercholesterolemia, so expanding that indication to a wider set of people. But they also have completely novel candidates that they're studying. There's one drug called Fasinumab, and they're studying that in osteoarthritis pain, as well as chronic lower back pain. They have a PD-1 drug, which is something we talk a little bit about on this show, and that one is called REGN2810. Campbell: Kristine, just to interrupt for a second, I think that one might be the one that investors really want to focus on in the pipeline. Harjes: Yeah, because it could be huge. These PD-1 drugs are absolutely enormous in their scope. Currently, the 2810 drug is being studied in Phase III in non-small cell lung cancer. They initiate it in the second quarter. They also have a potentially pivotal Phase II study in basal cell carcinoma that was indicated in the quarter. Because of the mechanism of action, it could absolutely be possible for this drug to treat a variety of different cancers, and could seriously rack up some sales there. Campbell: Yeah, we talked about Opdivo and Keytruda a lot on the show. Those are the two top-selling PD-1 drugs. They have combined sales of over $2 billion per quarter right now. Obviously, this is a huge market that could be targeted. What companies like Regeneron are doing, they're a little bit late to the dance, they're looking for indications that are under-treated where they can get fast-track and early-accelerated approval, so they can play a little bit of catch-up. So they're smaller indications, but they can get to the market quicker, and then they can file for supplemental approvals after that on a little bit more of an expedited time frame so they start to generate some sales. I think the thing to watch here is data from their trial in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common cause of skin cancer. Data from a pivotal Phase II trial is expected in that soon. If that's good, they think they can file for approval within the next 12 months. So theoretically, depending on if they get fast-tracked or not, you could have this PD-1 drug hitting the market in, we'll call it 18 months. Harjes: Yeah, when you look at Regeneron's most recent quarterly earnings statement, the press release has this grid on it, and its upcoming catalysts. I believe, if I'm recalling it correctly, it's just for the remainder of the year. And it's packed. There are so many things in this list. If you extend that one year out, it's just incredible how many different pivotal trials will have data, or potential approvals, or filing for FDA approval. This company really has a lot going on for it. One thing that I want to highlight before we sign off, because we haven't talked about this very much, is the collaboration that they have with Sanofi. Sanofi is a partner on almost all of the drugs that we talked about. They have a huge, long-standing relationship. There's also the Bayer partnership on Eylea. So this is a company that plays well with others, and it's been very profitable so far to pursue this kind of partnership strategy. Campbell: Right. But Sanofi's walking away from this partnership, at least in the antibody development, at the end of this year. People will have to take a look and see what that means. Regeneron will end up getting reimbursed less money for research and development next year from Sanofi. I don't think that's going to be a substantial number, but it could be a number that put a little bit of headwinds on sales growth for some of the smaller drugs like Kevzara. If you lose $30 to $40 million in development revenue per quarter, that could have an impact. So you have to watch and see how that plays out. Sanofi is going to continue to work on the existing drugs with Regeneron, and they do still have a separate pact in immuno-oncology. Again, we were just talking about the PD-1 drug -- that's a Sanofi-shared drug, as well. They're going to continue to develop that together, as well. I think overall, Kristine, this is a financially stable, fast-growing company. Their earnings are growing quicker than Celgene's, for example, year over year. They have a lot going on. I think it's worth having on people's radar. Harjes: Yeah. I think that the Sanofi collaboration is ending come December, is a little bit of a sign of maturity with this company. When you're an early stage company, it's a lot more important that you have a big brother of sorts handing you money to develop your early-stage candidates, get them through all the clinical-trial processes, which are very expensive. But then you have drugs on the market, and you're kicking off your own free cash flow. So that's kind of the place where Regeneron is right now, and it's actually at a point where it can be the big brother, or the big sister, itself. For example, they have an agreement with a smaller company called Intellia Therapeutics, and they're working with them on some CRISPR research. It's very early stage, as with everything CRISPR. But Regeneron is now responsible for shouldering the development costs for Intellia, and it'll pay Intellia some milestones, it'll pay royalties on future sales. But because this company has gotten to be of a size where it has financial weight, it has money at its disposal to do things. The balance sheet is incredibly strong. They have well over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, no long-term debt. They have another $1 billion in long-term investments. This is a company that's really come into its own and deserves to be talked about in this upper echelon of biotech stocks. Campbell: Yeah, it's not a cheap stock though, Kristine. That's the final takeaway for investors, too. It's a great growth story, but you're paying up a little bit for that growth. Harjes: Yeah, absolutely. Do you want to share some of the ratios? Campbell: Forward P/E of this stock is 29. If you compare that to Celgene, Celgene's forward P/E is 15. It's P/E-to-growth ratio is 1.74. If you look at the P/E-to-growth of Celgene, it's 0.82. It's trading at 9.5 times sales, Celgene's trading at 8.4 times sales. So it's a little bit of an expensive company. Again, those ratios are reflecting what we've done so far, not necessarily what we may do going forward. So bear that in mind, as well. As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

                                   companies having reported results for quarters ending May 28 or later, we’ve listed those that have increased their sales per share the most, while also improving their gross profit margins. Sales per share takes into account any dilution caused by the issuance of shares for any reason. Shares are often issued to fund an acquisition, so if sales-per-share go up after a merger is completed, it’s a good sign that the dilution was “worth it” for the acquiring company’s shareholders, or that the acquisition was partly or fully paid for with cash. The share count can also increase from stock-based compensation to executives — which companies routinely exclude from the adjusted-earnings figures that drive the “beat” or “miss” headlines. The per-share numbers also reflect any reduction to the share count caused by companies’ repurchase of stock. More on creative accounting and possible remedies: • Here’s how investors are duped each earnings season • The SEC is cracking down on made-up earnings numbers. We crunched the numbers — it hasn’t helped • Take-Two is one of five companies to say new accounting rules will have a material impact • Netflix needs to address new accounting standards if it continues licensing content • Target revises reporting after SEC calls out non-GAAP gross margin • Amazon says new accounting rule will change when it recognizes sales of its devices A company’s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. It is a measure of the profitability of a company’s core business and, in the list below, is calculated by FactSet using GAAP numbers, not companies’ “adjusted” numbers. So if a company increases its sales per share significantly, while its gross margin also increases, it’s a good sign that it didn’t need to offer huge discounts to juice sales. This provides a basis for further research as you consider which companies to invest in.

                                    hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has maintained notable support, circa 2,416, a level matching the June FAANG-induced low. The question now is the rally attempt’s quality. Near-term resistance (2,437) is followed by firmer overhead matching the former breakout point, the June peak of 2,453. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly maintained its first notable support. The specific area matches its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — better illustrated on the daily chart. Conversely, the Dow’s near-term breakdown point (21,840) pivots to resistance, and the initial retest should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has reached one-month lows. Still, a retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath, currently 6,271, is underway early Tuesday. On further strength, major overhead matches the 6,344 area, also illustrated on the daily chart below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has stalled at the 6,342 breakdown point, and violated the 50-day moving average, currently 6,271. More broadly, the prevailing downturn originates from the late-July key reversal (the long red bar) and includes two directionally sharp August downdrafts. The intervening rally attempts have thus far been flat. Bearish intermediate-term price action. Tactically, a rally atop the 50-day would mark technical progress, while a close atop the 6,342 breakdown point would more firmly neutralize the August downturn. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains the strongest major benchmark. To reiterate, the index has narrowly maintained its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — an area closely followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 21,642. Viewed in isolation, the Dow’s August downturn has inflicted limited true technical damage. Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s jagged August downturn has inflicted damage. Namely, the S&P has violated its breakout point (2,453) a level closely matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,450. Conversely, significant support broadly spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. This week’s low currently rests at 2,417. Broadly speaking, the August downturn remains uneven — the technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all — though damage has been inflicted. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have tagged one-month lows, punctuating recent violations of the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials remain comparably resilient, maintaining the first well-defined support.

                                   has violated the 200-day moving average, currently 136.95. The downturn originates from a failed test of the breakdown point (138.85), nearly to the decimal. Bearish price action. Delving deeper, important support broadly spans from about 132.40 to 133.70. This area defines the range bottom, and matches the 2017 low. A violation opens the path to less-charted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Conversely, a nearly immediate rally atop the 200-day would place the brakes on bearish momentum. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has registered three straight closes under the 200-day moving average, currently 310.50. Here again, the downturn punctuates a failed test of the breakdown point. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have concurrently registered three-month lows. (Separately, consider that the iShares Russell 2000 ETF was narrowly negative year-to-date at Monday’s close — by a two-cent margin. The MDY has registered about a 2.2% year-to-date gain.)

                                   remains comparably stronger than the small- and mid-caps. The 200-day moving average, currently 234.90, remains distant. Still, the SPY has violated two key inflection points: Moreover, the tandem August downturns — the violations of support — have been fueled by volume spikes, encompassing a lighter-volume rally attempt. Bearish near-term price action. A retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath is underway early Tuesday, and should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Collectively, the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks continue to diverge. The prevailing technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. As it applies to the S&P 500, a near- to intermediate-term consolidation phase is underway. These respective trends are in flux. Recall that notable support spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. See Friday’s review. The S&P has bottomed this week at 2,417 — matching support — and the question now is the rally attempt’s quality. When gauging the quality, notable S&P resistance spans from 2,450 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average, and the June peak. A retest from underneath is within view early Tuesday, and worth tracking. To reiterate, a nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 breakout point would place the S&P on firmer technical ground. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop has softened, as detailed Friday, and the August rally attempts have thus far lacked quality. The S&P 500’s more important longer-term trend remains firmly bullish. See also: Bull trend intact, S&P 500 absorbs mid-August plunge.

The major moving averages closely match support, circa 86, and the yen’s path of least resistance points higher barring a violation. More broadly, the FXY has cleared the 50- and 200-week moving averages — again, closely matching the 86 mark, illustrated on the three-year chart — consistent with a potentially material trend shift.

Tactically, resistance broadly spans from about 24.50 to 24.70 — levels matching the trendline and the breakdown point — and an eventual close higher would places the brakes on bearish momentum. More broadly, recall that the dollar has formed a massive double top, illustrated on the four-year chart. An eventual violation of major support (23.96) would resolve the pattern, opening the path to potentially significant downside follow-through.

 jumped nearly 30%. Market participants said they were also following reports that Gary Cohn was resigning as economic adviser to President Donald Trump, but the White House has countered those rumors. U.S. equity benchmarks had been facing selling pressure at the start of trade, as European markets ended lower after a three-day winning streak. “In Europe, we had weakness out of the gate and then we had worries about the Cohn news,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. “With the light volume, Barcelona is not something that the market is going to handle well.” The equity market was also digesting minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, as well as the dissolution of a pair of Trump’s business-advisory panels, which underscores the president’s challenges in promoting his Wall Street-friendly policies. The president has faced a furor after he repeatedly blamed “both sides” for violence last weekend at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Overall, Fed minutes were read as dovish, lowering expectations of another rate increase this year. “There’s no direct market impact in what Trump has done recently, but if things continue to be so polarized that his agenda is completely dead on arrival, that would have a negative impact,” Alpine’s Spellman said.

563,Chris Edelson,8242017,MarketWatch,8172017,"Published: Aug 24, 2017 11:58 a.m. ET U.S. business leaders should call for the president to resign By In ordinary times, it would be a mistake to expect CEOs to take a national leadership role during political crisis. CEOs are risk-averse and rarely see any upside to weighing in publicly on political debate. But these are not ordinary times. CEOs already see that the biggest risk for them when it comes to President Donald Trump is failing to act. The blowback from the Charlottesville, Va. violence and the resultant implosion of Trump’s business councils shows that CEOs can play a pivotal role by taking a stand against the president. With the United States facing what Republican Senator Ben Sasse described — back in March —  as a “civilization-warping crisis of public trust,” business titans have already displayed backbone by rebuking the president in the days since Charlottesville. They can do more. CEOs have had to act because of public demand and because the Republican-controlled Congress has not. Having taken the important first step of disbanding the White House business councils, the CEOs who have left these councils (and their peers) should now go further and call for Trump's resignation. These former council members are the most important CEOs in the nation — leaders of General Electric

                                   , and more. CEOs need to act in unison, coalescing behind a common statement —  a CEO manifesto — that we provide below. This need not be a pipe dream; After all, the CEOs in the president’s councils not only agreed to disband and resign, but some were also discussing  condemning Trump. GM CEO Mary Barra’s involvement, ironically, harkens back to that classic dictum, uttered in 1953 by then GM CEO Charles Erwin Wilson when GM was the most powerful corporation in America: ""What was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa."" What Barra and other prominent CEOs seem to be saying now is that Trump is not good for the country, and the corollary: that his leadership not good for General Motors or other big U.S. companies. Yet if CEOs instead sit on the sidelines, will future generations see them as complicit in lending support to a president who threatens core American values of morality, democracy, society, and capitalism? American business, however economically motivated, has more of a moral compass than Trump, and in this moment, morality and business considerations overlap. To be sure, some  CEOs opposed Trump early on,   during the presidential campaign. After the inauguration, some CEOs (especially from technology) countered the president  on immigration, signing on to an amicus brief and making public statements.  Other CEOs spoke up  after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. What is needed now is dramatic, decisive, and collective action to save the country from an out-of-control president.  Let’s consider how CEOs might support a manifesto calling for the president’s resignation. Step 1 —  A trigger:  One trigger for action just happened with Trump’s response to Charlottesville; but other triggers are likely in the coming weeks and months. A trigger may also result from the legal inquiries against the president.  And there may be foreign events (the standoff with North Korea); or a stock market downturn. Step 2 — Coalesce and confer:  We know that such gatherings, via conference calls, took place  soon after Charlottesville. The largest density of CEOs is in the Business Roundtable, which is aligned with Trump’s deregulation and tax reduction agenda.The Roundtable is led by JPMorgan Chase CEO

We believe that: We conclude that: Donald Trump is a clear danger to American capitalism, American workers, and American democracy. The threat he poses is unprecedented. This is not a partisan issue — some of us are Republicans, some Democrats, some are Independents. Our concerns are serious.  We are worried about the security and future of the United States itself.

565,Barbara Kollmeyer,8242017,MarketWatch,8172017,"Published: Aug 17, 2017 4:27 p.m. ET Officials embark on terrorism investigation By MADRID (MarketWatch) — A popular promenade in Barcelona, Spain, became a scene of panic and devastation on Thursday after a van rammed pedestrians, leaving a dozen people dead and dozens more injured. The incident took place on Las Ramblas, a long, tree-lined street that is typically packed with tourists and locals, around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. Eastern time). Local media were at one point reporting that hostages were being held at a bar near the scene of the attack by other assailants, but later reports cast doubt on the matter. The Associated Press cited the regional president in reporting that two suspects had been arrested. The Wall Street Journal, citing the jidahist-activity-monitoring organization SITE Intelligence Group, reported that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, tweeted that terrorists would never defeat a united people who love freedom. The seaside city was on lockdown in the immediate wake of the attack, with residents told to not leave their homes and many reported to be sheltering inside stores and restaurants and bars that closed the moment news of the attack reached them. S'acaba de produir atropellament massiu a les Rambles de Barcelona, per part d'una persona amb una furgoneta. Possiblement varis ferits Media reports in Spain and the U.S. indicated the police were treating the incident as a terrorist attack. The police presence on streets in the Spanish capital Madrid, some 600 kilometers southwest of Barcelona, was sharply escalated in the wake of the Barcelona attack. Nathalie Lezcano Sticchi, a 28-year-old resident of Barcelona who lives near the area, told MarketWatch she had passed the scene of the attack just five minutes before, stepping off the Ramblas to go into a Zara clothing store on a side street. “When I was on the first floor, one of the guys who was working [at Zara] said, ‘You have to go outside, we are going to close because something is happening at the Ramblas,’ ” Sticchi said in a telephone interview. She said a friend had forwarded her a message from his mother, who had been at Las Ramblas and seen a truck crashing into people. Sticchi ran to her house, as stores drew their shutters all around her. “People were running everywhere, and no one understood what was going on,” she said, “and I started hearing ambulances.” Several metro lines were closed in Barcelona, and the area remained sealed off into the evening. Police were urging individuals not to share images of the crash site on social media. They also thanked the media for pixellating images they had chose to use of victims: GRACIAS a todos los medios y particulares que estáis pixelando y obviando imágenes duras de víctimas y de operativo policial. #RESPETO Trucks are normally allowed up the Ramblas to make deliveries, and according to Sticchi it has a fairly heavy police presence. Spain hasn’t suffered a major attack on its soil since 2004, when an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell detonated simultaneous explosions on the Cercanias commuter train in Madrid on March 11. The attack, which took place three days before Spain’s general election, killed 192 people and injured thousands. The van attack on Las Ramblas killed 12 and injured 80, according to an NBC News report citing the regional president. The Barcelona scene is one that has become all too familiar in Europe. A deadly truck attack in Nice, France, in July of last year left 86 people dead and hundreds injured. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. In December 2016, a truck was deliberately driven into the Christmas market in Berlin, leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for those attacks, along with a deadly attack near London Bridge in June. Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?
