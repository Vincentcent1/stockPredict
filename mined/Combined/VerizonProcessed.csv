The sale represents Verizon’s efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world’s biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. “We’ve been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,” Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix’s total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon.

1,,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of Asia’s biggest technology companies said they were looking to expand investment in the United States, as President-elect Donald Trump pushes to bring manufacturing and jobs back home. Son said on Tuesday, after meeting Trump, his investment would create 50,000 new jobs, a move the U.S. President-elect claimed was a direct result of his election win. The lack of details on the investment timetable also prompted doubts on whether the promise of money and jobs will be met, as Sprint is slashing staff numbers to cut more than $2 billion in costs this fiscal year. Trump’s moves since the election to engage with individual companies, while turning his back on broader, years-in-the-works trade deals, show that he is leaning on the deal-making skills he honed in the boardroom. Trump campaigned against the over-regulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama. The $50 billion investment, announced jointly by Trump and Son in the lobby of the Trump Tower in Manhattan, would come from the $100 billion tech investment fund the head of SoftBank is setting up with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he’s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,” Trump said. “He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” Trump later Tweeted. Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth, would create the jobs by investing in startup companies. He also said he expected a lot of “deregulation” under a Trump administration. Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump’s four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration. The page also showed an additional $7 billion investment and creation of a further 50,000 jobs. (cnb.cx/2he38VQ) “While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials,” the Foxconn statement said. Son and Foxconn founder Terry Gou are considered close and have several business ventures together, including launching humanoid Pepper - which is manufactured by Foxconn - into several markets, and investing jointly in India. Foxconn has manufacturing facilities in the U.S. states of Virginia and Indiana, according to its website (here). Its 2015 annual report also listed logistics services in California and Texas. In October, prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the $100 billion tech fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Shares in SoftBank jumped 6.2 percent on Wednesday in Tokyo to their highest since August last year. “Now the market sees SoftBank as a Trump-related stock and that’s because it reacted favorably to their meeting,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a fund manager at Dalton Capital in Japan. Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son’s comments. They closed up 1.5 percent, while shares of T-Mobile US rose 1.8 percent. It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank’s investment had been disclosed before. SoftBank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt. Whether or not Trump’s election led to SoftBank’s planned investment, the billionaire’s victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote. Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world’s largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Back in 2011, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) seemed like a fading player in the wireless subscription business. The duopoly of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) owned 65% of the market, while T-Mobile came in a distant fourth place, with just 11% of the market. Times, however, have changed. Revitalized by CEO John Legere's ""Uncarrier"" plan that has expanded to include a wide number of initiatives, the company has grown to capture almost 17% of the market. While Verizon remains the top dog, with 35% of wireless subscriptions nationwide, such a drastic improvement leads to a simple question: Is T-Mobile's stock a better buy at today's prices? There's no definitive way to answer that, but there are three different lenses through which we can answer the question. Cash in the bank is awfully boring. But it's incredibly important. That's because every business -- at some point in time -- will run into rough patches. Whether they be company-specific or macro in nature, those with lots of cash on hand will be rewarded with optionality. Those with lots of debt, on the other hand, won't be so lucky. They will have to narrow their focus to just making ends meet to stay out of bankruptcy. The telecom industry requires heavy debt levels to maintain the enormous infrastructure required to meet our data demands, but we can still investigate where breathing room may exist. Here's how Verizon and T-Mobile stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $7.6 billion $103 billion $14 billion $11.5 billion T-Mobile $6.2 billion $21.8 billion $1.4 billion $1.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes long and short-term investments. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. It's important to point out that Verizon is valued at roughly four-and-a-half times the size of T-Mobile. Given that, I can't help but give the nod here to T-Mobile. In terms of a cash-to-debt position, T-Mobile clearly has the upper hand -- with a somewhat comparable level of cash but only one-fifth the debt level. Of course, much of the debt that Verizon has is because the company bought out the stake that Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) had in Verizon Wireless -- a critically important piece of Verizon's overall empire. But we'll get to the benefits that this bestows on shareholders in the next section. Often referred to as a ""moat"" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are perhaps the most important metric for any investor to consider. Evaluating a moat is part art, part science. In essence, the moat is the special sauce that makes a company what it is -- and differentiates it from all of the other players in the industry. Both T-Mobile and Verizon are beneficiaries of high barriers to entrance. In short, we don't see a lot of start-ups popping up to vie for your mobile subscription dollars. That's because it's prohibitively expensive to build out data networks. Verizon's moat is provided by the company's top spot within the industry. With 35% of all wireless subscriptions, and a fairly low churn rate, the company is able to rake in tons of free cash flow every month. It has also expanded beyond wireless service to become an Internet provider (FiOS), and it owns AOL's properties -- and will soon own Yahoo!'s operating business. It's yet to be seen exactly how these acquisitions will play out. T-Mobile, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a first-mover in the no-contract plans among the country's biggest players. Legere, in effect, is doubling down on convenience and customer service, saying, ""We're so much better than the others, we'll give our customers the choice to leave, and they still won't."" Of course, Legere has come up with other ways to keep customers around -- equipment installment plans or promotions tied to monthly bill credits -- but the bottom line is that the strategy has served as an important differentiator. The strategy has paid off thus far, but it's worth stating that Verizon and AT&T have already started offering much the same deal, and it may erode T-Mobile's advantage over time. In addition, we are already seeing Verizon move beyond simply being a wireless carrier and into a fully fledged media and content company -- via the aforementioned Yahoo and AOL tie-ups. That's something that T-Mobile simply can't compete with at this point -- from a cash, cash flow, or acquisition standpoint. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Verizon 13 18 1.6 4.2 T-Mobile 35 29 1.3 0.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Morningstar. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Normally, that would make me give the nod to T-Mobile. However, there's one extra variable to consider: the dividend. Verizon has a healthy and sustainable 4.5% yield, while T-Mobile has none to speak of. Given that, I'm siding with Verizon, here. So, there you have it. If I had to boil this down to one sentence, it would be this: T-Mobile has better growth prospects, but Verizon is the safer bet and offers a dividend. Truth be told, both are probably worthy of your consideration, but for those seeking income via dividends, Verizon is the obvious choice. ","

Image source: Getty Images. For those looking to pad their retirement accounts with solid dividend payers, the sight of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) dividend seems too good to be true. A 4.5% yield from an industry leader trading for a 50% discount to the broader market? Yes, please! But as you'll see below, it's worth digging in to see if all that glitters really is gold before putting your hard-earned cash behind the company. For dividend investors, the most important thing to continually evaluate is a company's free cash flow (FCF) statement. This represents the amount of cash an organization can put in its pocket by running its business, minus any capital expenditures. At the end of the day, it is from FCF that healthy companies pay their dividends -- and as the FCF trends change, so too do a company's dividend policies. This is where I ran into something somewhat concerning. Over the past 12 months, Verizon has brought in $11.5 billion in FCF. There's nothing wrong with that. But in order to pay its dividend, the company used 80% of FCF. While that's technically sustainable, it raises two red flags: (1) If the company meets tough times, maintaining the dividend may be difficult, and (2) even if it doesn't encounter difficulties, Verizon may not be able to grow its dividend substantially moving forward. But by digging deeper, we can see this might be a bit more of an anomaly than a trend. In June of this year, Verizon ratified its collective bargaining agreement with employees. Because of that, Verizon ""recorded ... charges of approximately $3.6 billion."" That's a huge one-time charge, and it showed up in the company's bottom line and on the FCF statement. While it's definitely important to note such a big charge, it's also worth asking if this is something that long-term investors should really be worried about. To get a better idea of the trends at Verizon, I suggest investors back up and look at the company's history of FCF and dividend payments over the past decade. When we do that, here's what we see: Data source: SEC filings. Viewed through this lens, there are a couple of things that stand out. First, while the trend is certainly not linear, FCF has undoubtedly trended upwards over the past decade -- increasing an average of 12% per year. Second, the dividend is historically very safe, with 2005 being the only year where the payout ratio from FCF eclipsed even 65%. The bottom line: Verizon's dividend is pretty safe. Before giving my full-fledged support to Verizon, there are a few other caveats worth considering. First and foremost, while the company is the largest mobile provider in America, the telecom landscape is not what it used to be. Verizon, sensing that disruption and innovation are rampant in today's technological setting, has branched out into other lines of business. That's evident through the company's acquisition of AOL and the announced plan to buy Yahoo!'s core operating business. I wouldn't be surprised to see the company continue to trend toward other strategic initiatives. What investors need to watch is whether or not those moves materially affect Verizon's cash flow statement. If they do, then there may be cause for concern regarding the company's dividend. If not, however, I have no problem endorsing Verizon's fat 4.5% payout as a safe and sustainable one. ","

Image source: Netflix. Donald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory. However, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes. Netflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, ""We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points."" Netflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of ""crony capitalism."" Though net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes. In February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to ""preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.  The Open Internet platform above all prohibits blocking access to websites, throttling traffic, or accepting payment to favor one content source over another. Telecoms like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have fought the regulations in the past, and an appeals court struck down portions of a former net neutrality bill in 2014. If Trump's FCC rolls back net neutrality, it could have a number of consequences for Netflix, other streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime, and small, independent content providers that may be unable to afford higher fees that ISPs could charge for better service. The most likely outcome of the unraveling of net neutrality is that prices for consumers will go up as ISPs could charge extra fees to carry streams from bandwidth hogs like Netflix. Stricter data caps could also apply to mobile devices, making it harder to use such services away from home. The biggest threat to Netflix, however, could be cable providers giving so-called ""fast lane"" treatment to their own services, as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could do for its Stream service. The end of net neutrality would also give additional leverage to a combined AT&T (NYSE:T)-Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), as AT&T could use its Pay TV services like DirecTV and U-Verse to give preferential treatment to HBO and the Turner cable networks owned by Time Warner. While rolling back net neutrality would be a challenge for content providers like Netflix, it would be a boon for cable and internet service providers, whose stocks have gained since the election. NFLX data by YCharts. The net neutrality development comes at a time when communities are already toying with the idea of a ""Netflix tax"" or a surcharge on streaming services that treats them like a utility. Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality. ","

Image source: Getty. Buying telecom stocks probably seems like a fairly straightforward exercise. Due to the industry's relative stability, some investors regard telecommunications companies as similar to utilities, a sleepy and staid industry if ever there was one. In reality, though, investing in telecom stocks isn't nearly as clear-cut as it might seem. In this two-part article, we will examine a host of key business and financial metrics that investors need to consider before actually investing in any telecom stock. Image source: Author. If you read through any telecom company's annual report, you're guaranteed to come across the commonly used metric ""churn rate."" The term simply refers to the number of subscribers that leave their service over a given period of time, as a percentage of total subscribers. The number isn't unique to the telecom industry, though; churn rates are often measured in sectors that use subscription-based business models, like the cable-TV industry. The lower the churn rate, the better, since customer defections act as a headwind to revenue growth and profit margins. Telecom companies disclose their churn rates in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S) have each maintained churn rates of between 1% and 2% over the past year. As the U.S. smartphone market matures, telecom companies are increasingly attempting to grow by courting one another's customers. This has led to a minor rise in churn rates in recent quarters, though they are unlikely to spike appreciably beyond their current range. Investors researching telecom stocks will certainly want to closely monitor this crucial metric. Perhaps the second most commonly discussed performance metric in the telecom industry is average revenue per user, or ARPU. Just as it sounds, this measures the typical revenue garnered from one customer. Telecom companies closely monitor this metric to help shape their near-term and long-term growth strategies. Growing ARPU can prove particularly lucrative for telecom companies, since applying new revenue-growth strategies to current users flows directly to the bottom lines. The general ARPU trend among U.S. telecom carriers has largely been downward over the past several years, the result of continued price competition among the four main industry leaders. Sprint and T-Mobile have aggressively slashed prices and added other incentives to court customers away from AT&T and Verizon. However, in response, AT&T and Verizon have both expanded the breadth of their product offerings -- AT&T bought DIRECTV, and Verizon acquired AOL and Yahoo! -- to further monetize their customer bases. Telecom companies also track subscriber metrics including Average Billings Per User, Average Revenue Per Account, and Average Billings Per Account, which generally attempt to provide the same kind of user-level insight into a company's revenue-generation capabilities. Either way, anyone considering investing in a telecom stock should review the company's ARPU and its general direction to gain a better sense of the business's overall health. As you can see, each of the four major U.S. telecom operations offers a reasonably strong network, with AT&T and Sprint suffering from relatively slower upload speeds. This picture changes from region to region, and from urban to rural environments. Furthermore, with each telecom already testing 5G -- the next evolution for wireless standards -- their differences in network quality are certain to change throughout the latter half of the decade. Telecom companies have historically been strong dividend stocks. As just one example, the sector's 4.2% average dividend yield is more than double the S&P 500's 2% payout. Though the sector overall has a high average yield, there are divergences between companies in the sector. Here's how the four largest telecom stocks vary by dividend policy: Company Name Dividend Yield No. Consecutive Annual Dividend Increases AT&T 5.3% 31 Verizon Communications 4.9% 9 Sprint N/A N/A T-Mobile US N/A N/A Data sources: Dividend.com and Google Finance. As you'll see in future sections, a telecom company's dividend policy often reflects its current financing circumstances. For example, Frontier Communications' 13.2% dividend yield reflects the heightened long-term risk that comes with its legacy landline strategy, which many investors expect to gradually erode in the coming years. On the other end of the spectrum, Sprint and T-Mobile intentionally avoid paying dividends in favor of investing all their excess cash into improving their wireless networks, in hopes of stealing subscribers from AT&T and Verizon. Taking the time to understand the reasons a telecom firm pursues its dividend policy can absolutely save you from a costly investment mistake. The telecom industry is notably capital-intensive. In order to provide a competitive network, telecommunications companies have to invest extensively in a wide range of fixed assets. As such, telecom operators often tap debt markets to fund a large part of their operations. The industry's subscription model -- in which cash flows tend to be fairly consistent -- also supports the use of leverage. As such, investors need to dig into a telecom company's balance sheet as part of their due diligence. A number of common balance-sheet ratios can prove extremely useful here. Investors can look at a company's debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, net cash, and debt as a percentage of invested capital. Used together, these and other balance-sheet ratios can give you a view into a company's long-term financial viability. Think you're getting the hang of analyzing telecom stocks?

    A 10-Point Checklist for Investing in Telecom Stocks (Part 1) -- The Motley Fool

15,Andrew Tonner,12082016,Fool,12012016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. In Part 1 of this article series on honing your abilities to analyze telecom stocks, we discussed the first five points investors need to understand as part of their research process. To recap, investors should understand important industry metrics such as churn and ARPU, examine the network quality of the company and its relevant competitors, research the dividend policy, and review its capital structure -- all before buying a telecom stock. Now let's consider five additional items for investors to consider. Image source: author. Spectrum rights are the lifeblood of modern mobile networks. Similar to how radio stations own the rights to broadcast over a certain frequency and geography, telecom companies own the rights to similar frequencies of radio waves that we simply refer to as spectrum. So it only makes sense that a telecom investor should have a basic understanding of a wireless provider's spectrum holdings. The good news is, that's fairly easy to do. Telecom operators provide information about their spectrum holdings and lease arrangements in their annual reports. If you're interested in a certain geographic area, the Federal Communications Commission maintains a website detailing which wireless companies own the rights to various spectrum frequencies. Telecom companies throw off gobs of cash, thanks to their relatively stable, subscription-based business models. As discussed in this article's companion piece, building and maintaining a competitive wireless network requires substantial capital expenditures, which can erode those free cash flows. The differences between providers on these matters can be eye-opening. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) enjoy subscriber bases roughly twice the size of Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and the tremendous difference shines through in terms their cash flow generation. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash flow from operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital expenditures $19.2 billion $17.7 billion $7.0 billion $4.7 billion Free cash flow from operations $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending March 31, 2016. Though much has been made of T-Mobile's and Sprint's recent challenges to AT&T and Verizon, this chart reveals the extent of the financial differences among U.S. wireless providers. This sizable difference in cash flow generation gives AT&T and Verizon far more flexibility to invest in future growth drivers (see below). They can more easily spend more on marketing, promotional pricing, and other measures to fend off their resurgent competitors. In fact, I maintain that this chart provides one of most useful ways to frame the competitive landscape in the U.S. telecom market. Any investor looking at this market needs to examine the stock in question in a similar manner before buying. As many smartphone markets in developed countries mature, revenue growth strategies are evolving at most telecoms in ways investors need to understand. For example, T-Mobile and Sprint remain the underdogs in the U.S. wireless market. To try to close that cash flow generation gap, both parties remain focused on growing their 4G wireless subscribers through a mix of marketing and price competition; T-Mobile's ""Un-carrier"" campaign is perhaps the best example. Image source: T-Mobile. However, in terms of their free cash flow advantages, AT&T and Verizon have instead pursued M&A strategies that should allow them to grow ARPU, albeit in different ways. Verizon has made a bet on building out its mobile advertising business by spending roughly $9 billion to acquire content and ad-tech powers AOL and Yahoo! over the past two years. AT&T, on the other hand, is moving to fashion itself into a one-stop shop for mobile connectivity and video programming through its purchase of DIRECTV and its proposed Time Warner buyout. Since it takes money to make money, investors need to understand a company's upcoming investment plans before buying. As was the case with their spectrum holdings, wireless providers typically offer some information on their near-term investment plans in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T's annual report states, ""We expect our 2016 capital investment, which includes our capital expenditures plus vendor financing payments related to our Mexico network, for our existing businesses to be in the $22,000 range, and we expect our capital investment to be in the 15 percent range of service revenues or lower from 2016 through 2018."" Finding this information doesn't have to take a lot of time -- I found it from a quick search. As with all good investing, it's critical to understand the cast of characters at the helm of a company. In fact, finding companies run by strong managers is one of the bedrocks of the Fool's primer on how to buy stocks. Among U.S. wireless providers, this is a fairly easy process, as the four largest wireless providers in the country are run by a well-known set of executives: Randall Stephenson  at AT&T, Lowell McAdam at Verizon, John Legere at T-Mobile, and Marcelo Claure at Sprint. A quick search can reveal the background information for the executive team and board of directors of a company that interests you. Furthermore, companies are required to publish their executive compensation plans in their annual proxy filings, which you can find on the investor-relations page of a company's website. Successfully buying telecom stocks requires quite a bit of analysis and familiarity with industry-specific metrics. However, with a little practice, anyone can get the hang of it. Equally important, using this checklist can help reveal some important risk factors that might not leap out at first glance. Getting to that point might require some additional upfront effort on your part, but the rewards will be worth it. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

18,,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe’s Sky Plc SKYB.L, said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","

20,,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"The end of negotiations was not a complete surprise. Les Moonves, the longtime chief executive of CBS, said last week talks were still stuck in the early stages, more than two months after the Redstones asked the boards of both companies to explore a tie-up. The two sides never entered talks on pricing and were far apart on Viacom’s value, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Shares of Viacom were down 7.9 percent at $39.10 in afternoon trading. In afternoon trading, CBS shares were down 0.4 percent at $62.12. National Amusements, the privately held movie company through which Shari Redstone and her 93-year-old father control 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom, said in a letter they stopped pushing for a deal on the expectation of a turnaround at Viacom under new leadership. Viacom named Bob Bakish, head of its international business, acting chief executive officer at the end of October, and made that position permanent on Monday afternoon as it announced the end of merger explorations. Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to turn around declining ad revenue and ratings while CBS is home to top-rated shows such “The Big Bang Theory” and “Thursday Night Football.” Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of Viacom and CBS, said he was not disappointed with the failure of merger plans and that he still believes that ultimately the two might merge. “Viacom needs to be fixed,” he said. One sticking point in negotiations was that CBS’s Moonves wanted autonomy over the merged company. National Amusements was willing to compromise on this issue, but in the end decided to let Bakish retain control of Viacom, according to the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Bakish already has started taking action after just a few weeks as acting CEO. Last month,  the company announced it was buying Argentine broadcaster Television Federal SA from telecom carrier Telefonica SA for $345 million. He is also looking to improve relations with affiliates and is working on a plan to turn around MTV, a top priority for him, he told Reuters in November. Last week, he replaced Viacom’s head of distribution, Denise Denson, a longtime executive who worked closely with former CEO Philippe Dauman. In September, National Amusements called on Viacom and CBS to consider recombining, 10 years after Viacom was spun off from CBS. Shari Redstone had been in favor of recombining the two under Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. Industry speculation that the two might rejoin increased this year after the Redstones prevailed in a power struggle that resulted in Dauman’s departure. A Viacom spokesman confirmed it had received the letter from National Amusements, which was first reported by CNBC. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusement’s letter also said: “CBS continues to perform exceptionally well under Les Moonves.” Relations between Moonves and Shari Redstone continue to be good, the source said. This week, the two plan to go to Boston for the premiere of the film “Patriots Day,” produced by CBS Films. ","

The company stock was down 2.25% in pre-market trading. In a press release late Wednesday, Yahoo said it believes an “unauthorized third party” stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August of 2013. That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.)

We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead.

""Assuming no major acquisitions through 2019, we believe Charter can generate sufficient free cash flow (FCF) to repurchase about 25% of its current float by 2019,"" the analyst wrote. What’s more, he said he thinks Charter can grow operating FCF by 15% a year between now and 2019. (See also: Charter Shares Up After RBC Starts Coverage.) While TCI thinks Charter will be a target for Verizon, Charter CEO Thomas Rutledge said this week the cable operator doesn’t need a content buy, saying he liked the position the company is in. ""We are a connection company at the moment, and I like that place."" Speaking during an investor conference, Rutledge said there's a lot of opportunity with its current business model and that getting into the content area would just muck things up. He didn’t rule out making cable acquisitions, pointing out that the incoming Trump Administration appears more open to consolidation.

Image source: Getty Images. Data center real estate investment trust Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) will soon be a larger company following its purchase of a set of data center assets from Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Equinix agreed to pay $3.6 billion in cash to acquire 24 data center sites and their operations. All told, the sites contain 29 buildings, located in 15 metropolitan areas. Most of these are in the U.S.; two are located in South America, specifically Bogota, Colombia, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Equinix will also obtain 900 customers that currently use the facilities. Equinix expects the transaction to close by the middle of next year. Adding the Verizon assets to the REIT's current portfolio gives it 175 data centers in 43 localities, utilizing around 17 million gross square feet of space. Equinix believes the Verizon assets will be ""immediately accretive"" to its results. Specifically, the company estimates that it will add $450 million in revenue and $270 million in EBITDA in the 12 months after the deal closes. Verizon doesn't particularly want to be in the data center business, while Equinix is eager to expand. So this is an appropriate and opportunistic transaction for both parties. In its press release, the REIT quoted CEO Steve Smith as saying -- accurately, in my view -- that ""the new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros."" It's a good time to be in the data center business, as enterprises rely more and more on the services such facilities provide. Equinix has been doing well lately, with revenue and the bottom line in its most recently reported quarter both beating analyst estimates (although adjusted funds from operations -- the most important profitability metric for REITs -- slipped a little). With the Verizon buy, it's making hay while the sun shines, to quote a corny phrase, and investors should be pleased with the portfolio-expanding move. ","

Coverage map. Image source: Verizon Communications. There has been much hype this year about the next-generation 5G wireless network. However, investors looking to bet on the new network should forget about big wireless providers Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). For two main reasons, smaller, behind-the-scenes companies that are helping develop the new technology look like a more promising option. The country's two largest telecom businesses are working hard to bring the faster, more reliable network to market. Both have begun running technical trials and are planning real-world pilot programs beginning next year. A new wireless network will bring a flood of new sales of devices that are 5G-compatible. And a new round of fighting over wireless subscribers among the country's handful of carriers will no doubt ensue as well. But AT&T and Verizon aren't betting the farm on it, as made evident by each company's recent activity. For AT&T, it started with last year's DirecTV purchase, followed up by last month's proposed acquisition of Time Warner. Verizon has taken a slightly different path with its AOL and proposed Yahoo! acquisitions, as well as a slew of smaller tech and media company purchases. The goal in both instances are the same, though. The wireless carriers are transforming themselves into multimedia conglomerates rather than wireless network pure plays. A new 5G network will certainly play a part in both businesses, but it won't be leveraged in the same way as older networks were. Past wireless networks were all about increasing speed and reliability, and the next-gen network also won't disappoint. Initial testing is toting 5G as anywhere from 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G network. But download speeds are only part of the discussion. The 5G network will move beyond the world of cellphones and will encompass the entire universe of technology, what has been dubbed the Internet of Things. The needs of the new network will include being able to support billions of connected devices, everything from wearable tech like smartwatches to autonomous cars to sensors on industrial equipment. Much more than just a newer and faster network for telecommunications, 5G is really a new medium of data transmission that paves the way for new technology that will shape our world in the decades ahead. With that in mind, let's take a look at two stocks that could be good ways to play the latest tech revolution. With 5G set to encompass much more than just your smartphone, the companies that are helping develop the network and devices that will use it are a more appealing investment than the telecoms. Here are two companies much smaller than Verizon and AT&T that are at the forefront of this research. Image source: InterDigital. InterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC), which helped develop past wireless network technology, is also involved with engineering the latest 5G network. The company makes its money by developing solutions and earning patent fees and royalties for their use. Currently, InterDigital revenue comes from a combination of past technology royalties and new technology solutions income. It has been a good year as the top line has expanded with a large royalty sale of a past patent during the last quarter. In tandem with increasing sales has been an increasing bottom line as well, as the company has been looking for ways to keep costs down. IDCC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Much work remains for the development of the 5G network platform, and InterDigital's engineers have been tasked with solving some critical issues. On the work docket is developing ways to address the need for reliability of ultra-sensitive data transmission for autonomous driving and remote healthcare, and the need for traffic prioritization for billions of interconnected machine communications. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a designer and maker of wireless-connectivity-enabling semiconductors. The company's technology has been powering smartphones for some time, but as a new wave of devices come to market requiring connectivity, Skyworks has been there to answer the call as well. The company saw top-line sales slow dramatically this year, taking a breather after revenue more than doubled in the last five years. Profits also initially slid, but ended up finishing the fiscal year on a high note and notched a 26% year-over-year increase on decreasing expenses. SWKS Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Global smartphone growth has slowed since 2015, but the Internet of Things movement is just getting under way. When 5G begins to roll out in the next few years, new chips enabling connection to it will need to be developed and sold. Skyworks is in a good position to benefit when that happens. ","

Four huge companies that control 70% of the digital communications sector have been using their market power to overcharge the typical household about $45 a month ($540 per year), according to a new report (link opens in PDF) from the non-profit Consumer Federation of America (CFA). AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) form what the researchers call a ""tight oligopoly on steroids."" These four companies, according to the report, have protected their control over prices by not competing head-to-head to ""a remarkable extent,"" leading to more than $60 billion in annual overcharges. This is good for the companies and their shareholders. By not competing in three consumer-facing businesses -- wireless, broadband internet access, and multichannel video programming service (cable) as well as the behind-the-scenes data services -- these companies have been able to consistently keep prices moving up (while costs have fallen). ""Stockholders love the astronomical rate of return, but consumers hate it,"" said Dr. Mark Cooper, CFA's director of research and the author of the report, in a press release, ""which is reflected in the very low ratings that these products get in consumer satisfaction surveys."" The federation released its report while testifying against the AT&T/Time Warner merger. Comcast is one of the companies on the hot seat in this report. Image source: The Motley Fool. AT&T, Comcast, Charter, and Verizon have generally avoided competing with each other, keeping largely to territorial boundaries dating back to before the Telecommunications Act of 1996 when they enjoyed actual monopolies. The report noted that AT&T and Verizon were slow to go into the video business (though both are in it now) while the major cable companies still have chosen to not offer wireless services to compete directly with telecommunications companies. ""Instead of competing vigorously on a head-to-head basis, they preferred to buy each other out,"" the federation wrote. ""This not only eliminated the most likely potential competitors, but it also gave them huge fortress regions. Lax antitrust and regulatory policy for the first 15 years of the implementation of the 1996 Act allowed this to come about."" In the press release, Cooper was quoted as saying: ""All of the negative aspects of the tight oligopoly on steroids come into play in the ATT-TWX mergers.  In many respects ATT is the dominant player in the tight oligopoly, with a strong position in wireless, business data services, and video distribution. Allowing it to acquire a major content producer would give it much stronger incentives and an enhanced ability to leverage its market power to harm consumers and competition."" Competition lowers prices. In much of the country, when it comes to cable and internet service, AT&T (which owns DirecTV as well as the U-verse video service), Charter, and Comcast do not face comparable direct competition. Consumers might be able to opt for DISH Network to meet their television needs, but they still, in much of the country, would need AT&T, Charter, Comcast, or Verizon for broadband service. All four of these companies to different extents have pricing power based on many Americans simply not having any other realistic choice. The CFA did note that T-Mobile's ""aggressive competition strategy is definitely putting downward pressure on prices and excess profits, saving consumers $5-$10 per month."" Despite that, it found that the a typical household, which has two cellphones, one landline, and a video-internet bundle, that uses AT&T or Verizon still pays an extra $10 per line. ""To estimate the total overcharges, we applied the $10 [monthly] overcharge figure only to the subscribers of the dominant carriers [AT&T and Verizon],"" the federation wrote, working that out to total annual overcharges of more than $40 billion. ""This equals to just over a quarter of the revenues of the firms with overcharges,"" the federation said. The study found similar results in broadband and video bundles. It used an overcharge number of $25 per household per month, despite writing that ""there are reasons to believe that this estimate is low."" Since between 70 million and 90 million homes have bundled broadband and cable, Cooper used 80 million as the base to estimate aggregate overcharges. ""The total would be $24 billion,"" the report says, again about a quarter of the revenue in these segments for the firms with overcharges. The federation wrote that competition could ultimately force prices lower, stating that all four of these companies would be thriving even without the overcharges. ""We find that the companies have been throwing off cash at the rate of $80 billion per year for mergers and acquisitions, increased liquid assets (retained earnings and stock repurchases), excess dividends and high prices paid for auctioned spectrum to keep spectrum out of the hands of potential competitors,"" the report says. ""Thus, excess returns to shareholders easily account for the excess profits and cost-reducing competitive effects would add to total consumer savings."" Whether that competition comes depends on a number of things. Disruptive technology could, for example, offer more people a broadband alternative that could hurt these companies' ability to keep consumers in cable/internet bundles. That is already happening in the wireless space, but Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter have been very successful when it comes to keeping competition from gaining a toehold. It could happen, but deals like AT&T buying Time Warner make it even less likely. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Image source: Getty Images. The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the growing network of connected sensors and devices, and the increasing connectivity is already having significant impacts at the consumer, enterprise, and public levels. Research firm Gartner expects the number of IoT devices to grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearly 21 billion in 2020, and estimates that more than half of new business systems and processes will utilize the Internet of Things by the end of that period. Growth in device connectivity and machine-to-machine communication is creating an explosion of new data, and this information is being sorted and analyzed to produce insights that can improve efficiency and drive substantial economic value. Brian Feroldi (Verizon): There's no doubt that the Internet of Things trend offers tremendous growth opportunities for all kinds of tech companies. However, I personally do not think that buying an electronic hardware manufacturer is the right way to play the trend. The reason? Huge growth potential will attract a lot of competition. Over time, that competition will erode away profit margins, leaving investors with poor returns. For that reason, I think it is a far smarter idea to buy shares of a cellular network provider like Verizon Communications instead. After all, those billions of devices that are expected to come online will need access to a mobile network in order to work. That provides Verizon with a great new avenue for growth in the years ahead. You might not be aware of it, but Verizon is already benefiting from the IoT trend. Last quarter, Verizon's IoT revenue grew by 24% to $217 million, making it one of the company's fastest-growing divisions. Sure, that's still just a drop in the bucket when compared with the company's wireless and wireline revenue, but over time IoT revenue holds promise to grow like wildfire. That could help propel the company's long-term revenue and profit growth. Verizon certainly believes that the IoT represents a huge opportunity, which is why it is investing accordingly. Earlier this year, Verizon bought Telogis and Sensity Systems, both of which will add to the company's IoT product offering. Over time I think investors should expect even more bolt-on acquisitions to ensure that it maintains a strong foothold in this important and growing market. Throw in a dividend yield that tops 4.6% and I think Verizon is a great way for conservative investors to get their IoT exposure. Keith Noonan (Cisco): Overcoming security and standardization issues that arise from moving data between disparate devices and networks is one of the main obstacles to the evolution of connectivity, and no company is better suited to deal with it than Cisco. The company's Internet of Things and Applications Group vice president, Rowan Trollope, recently said that the company can deliver many of the connectivity and security needs brought on by IoT because ""it owns the network."" There's some simplification involved in that statement, but Cisco's leading position in networking means that the company is going to have a formative impact on the progression of IoT. The company is in the process of giving device makers tools and applications-programming interfaces to help with standardization and to cut down on security threats that could limit the progression of the tech. Cisco is taking these steps to get the big players on board with its network and certification process in order to facilitate its transition to a more subscription-based business model. This year, the company purchased Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion in order to bolster its service offerings and fast-track its position in IoT connectivity and analytics platforms. The big connectivity push also presents opportunities that could lift Cisco's hardware businesses. The networking giant has partnered with Ericsson, Intel, and Verizon for the development of a 5G mobile router, and could benefit from demand for routers and switches that are tailored for customers' IoT needs. Priced at just 12.5 times forward earnings estimates, with roughly $40 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books, and a 3.5% dividend yield, Cisco stock offers an inexpensive valuation, hefty returned income, and a forefront position in the Internet of Things.

Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

""It's not really about being the leader,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao told analysts last month. Vodafone believes the top two players in telecom markets -- and it doesn't matter if they are first or second -- are able to differentiate themselves through superior networks and services. By focusing investments in these two areas, the leading operators can justify higher prices. ""The gap versus No. 3s is not only stable, but even increasing,"" Mr. Colao said, adding ""it's about really creating a two-tier market."" Even after a $130 billion windfall from the 2014 sale of its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone has so far eschewed big, global expansion. Under Mr. Colao, a 55-year-old Italian reserve military officer who took over as CEO in 2008, the company left the consumer U.S. market and has plowed investment into Europe and the developing world instead. Vodafone's biggest competitors are typically formerly state-owned fixed-line giants still catching up in the mobile age. It earned GBP41 billion ($50 billion) in revenue for the last full fiscal year and ranks below only China Mobile Ltd. in terms of global subscribers. Over two years, Mr. Colao spent about $24 billion across his empire, which is concentrated in Europe, Africa and India, to expand high-speed mobile networks, the pillar of its marketing campaigns. Vodafone also spent about $20 billion in 2013 and 2014 to buy major cable operators in Germany and Spain, and it is expanding its wired cable and internet network so it can sell the telecom industry's Holy Grail: a ""quad-play"" package that offers mobile, landline telephone, cable and internet services on one bill. The results so far are mixed: Vodafone said last month that its plan was paying off in parts of Europe, but proving much more expensive than anticipated in India. Overall, Vodafone's organic revenue, which excludes foreign-exchange movement, grew 2.2% in the third quarter of 2016, outperforming the average 1.6% growth of major Europe-based telecom firms, according to Raymond James analyst Stephane Beyazian. Leading the way over the past six months was Germany, with 2.3% organic growth, and Italy, at 1.7%. But Vodafone's organic revenue declined 2.7% in its home market of the U.K. -- where it is the No. 3 mobile operator behind BT Group PLC, which operates the EE brand, and Telefónica SA's O2. Mr. Colao blames the shortfall partly on billing problems and customer-service complaints related to a new computer system. Even more costly has been defending its No. 2 status in India. New mobile carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., funded by India's richest man, has offered free service for at least a month to get new customers. Vodafone wrote down the value of its India business by EUR5 billion ($5.3 billion) earlier this month, citing the competition. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who gives stuff for free,"" Mr. Colao said. Vodafone was formed in Newbury, England, in 1984 and spun off from military and electronics conglomerate Racal Electronics Group in 1991. It was one of the world's first mobile-focused telecom companies, and obtained licenses in a hodgepodge of countries early in the cellphone era and via two big deals. It merged with AirTouch Communications, a San Francisco-based mobile carrier with world-wide holdings, in 1999. The next year, it acquired Mannesmann AG, a German telecommunications business with European operations. In 1999, Vodafone merged its U.S. mobile operations with those of Bell Atlantic Corp., with the latter renaming itself Verizon Communications Inc. They called their joint venture Verizon Wireless, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone the other 45%. Verizon Communications had long tried to buy out Vodafone's shares, but the two didn't reach an agreement until 2013. The sale closed in 2014. Vodafone gave back $84 billion from the sale to shareholders -- the largest single return in modern corporate history. A chunk of the remainder went to pay taxes and reduce debt. The rest of those funds helped bankroll Vodafone's two-year network-improvement program. The project, which mostly wrapped up this past spring, focused on expanding Vodafone's fourth-generation mobile network, or 4G, in Europe and both its fourth- and third-generation networks in emerging markets such as India. For years, Vodafone and John Malone's Liberty Global PLC have publicly flirted with the idea of a combination. The two companies expect to complete a merger of their operations in the Netherlands later this year, creating a 50-50 joint venture. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference last month, Mr. Colao and Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said the Dutch tie-up wasn't necessarily indicative of future deals. But Mr. Colao kept the door open. ""We see the world the same way,"" Mr. Colao told investors, describing Mr. Fries. ""Is this the first trial of something bigger? Not necessarily....But of course it helps to know each other.""

                                    in jeopardy. To make security great again, we must augment the best preventive security with detection capabilities that can catch an attacker red-handed at an early stage, before damage can occur. This is a departure from the conventional “Cold War” security mindset that is concerned with keeping attackers out by building taller and thicker walls. It involves assuming that attackers will break into the network and become active — the most common breach scenario of 2016 — and shifting strategy, tools and staffing as a result. Today, the industry average time for finding an active attacker is about five months, reflecting the colossal failure of conventional security. The state of the union for federal security is that few if any non-defense agencies can find an active attacker on their network. Most cannot find a network intruder or a malicious insider, such as a rogue employee or contractor, working to steal or damage information or assets. Consider that the National Security Agency, the Office of Personnel Management and the FBI were breached along top security vendors and agencies. If government agencies with some of the top security talent were no match for cybercriminals, how can an enterprise stand up to the same threats? Since most organizations, public or private, lack the ability to find active network attackers, there is no telling if an intruder is lurking and what they have been able to accomplish. Only in the relatively straightforward “breaking and entering” cybercrimes of stolen personal information or financial details does it become clear at some point that a breach has transpired and damage has been done. With other forms of attack, you may never know. While defensive security is essential, it is no longer sufficient to protect networks. Security leaders in business and government need to admit to today’s reality and focus efforts on detecting active attackers. They need to shift from the traditional model of first encountering a threat and then developing a way to identify and block it. Instead, they need to find attackers by their operational activities that may blend in with normal network events. Such detection is difficult, but it can be done. It requires security based on behavioral profiling to find exceptional attack activities, rather than just trying to prevent the installation of malware. Preventive security is actually quite good and can deflect the vast majority of external threats. The trouble is that it can’t prevent every one. There are far too many ways for an attacker to get into a network, often just through compromising an employee’s or contractor’s computer or account through phishing or malicious software that loads on an unsuspecting user from a legitimate website. Now, in addition to a strong defense, companies need to expect that attackers will be able make their way on to the network. They need to spot them by their operational activities—the step-by-step processes that attackers must perform to gain control of valuable network assets. Instead of trying to find aspects of “known bad,” security professionals need a model of “known good” so that attacker activities can stand out from normal network events. That, for example, would understand that no one in the marketing department has ever used a tool like PowerShell, which is for network administrators, and to flag it as an anomaly when one does. One of the most important questions Donald Trump should be asking after he takes office in January is: “Do we have the ability to know if there is an active attacker on our networks?” That should be followed up with: “If so, how?” or “What is our level of confidence?” C-suite executives should be asking the same questions. What’s needed in both the public and private sectors is a new impetus for protecting vital assets and entrusted information based on admitting that an attacker will get in. Continuing with today’s approach will only yield more devastating loss and damage and becomes an illustration of insanity. Security must be modernized to meet the modern challenges and make it great again. Kasey Cross is director of product management at LightCyber, a leading provider of behavioral attack detection.

39,,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe’s Sky Plc SKYB.L, said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","
                Yahoo under scrutiny after latest hack, Verizon seeks new deal terms | Reuters",0.9877
40,,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the summer of 2013, Yahoo Inc launched a project to better secure the passwords of its customers, abandoning the use of a discredited technology for encrypting data known as MD5. It was too late. In August of that year, hackers got hold of more than a billion Yahoo accounts, stealing the poorly encrypted passwords and other information in the biggest data breach on record. Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week. The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called “hashing” algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings. In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a U.S. government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 “should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.” Yahoo’s failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo’s security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts. Stronger hashing technology would have made it more difficult for the hackers to get into customer accounts after breaching Yahoo’s network, making the attack far less damaging, they said. “MD5 was considered dead long before 2013,” said David Kennedy, chief executive of cyber firm TrustedSec LLC. “Most companies were using more secure hashing algorithms by then.” He did not name specific firms. Yahoo, which has confirmed it was still using MD5 at the time of the attack, disputed the notion that the company had skimped on security. “Over the course of our more than 20-year history, Yahoo has focused on and invested in security programs and talent to protect our users,” Yahoo said in a statement to Reuters. “We have invested more than $250 million in security initiatives across the company since 2012.” The former Yahoo security staffers, however, told Reuters the security team was at times turned down when it requested new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections, on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority. Partly, that reflected the internet pioneer’s long-running financial struggles: Yahoo’s revenues and profits have fallen steadily since their 2008 peak while Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and others have come to dominate the consumer internet business. “When business is good, it’s easy to do things like security,” said Jeremiah Grossman, who worked on Yahoo’s security team from 1999 to 2001. “When business is bad, you expect to see security get cut.” To be sure, no system is completely hack-proof. Hackers have managed to break into passwords that were encrypted using more advanced technologies than MD5. Other Internet companies, such as LinkedIn and AOL, have also suffered security breaches, though none nearly as large as Yahoo’s. “This could happen to any large corporation,” said Tom Kellermann, a former World Bank security manager and security industry executive. Kellermann, now CEO of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, said he was not surprised that it had taken Yahoo several years to identify the massive attacks. “Hackers often have a capacity to burrow deeper than we thought into a system and remain for years,” he said. Reuters could not determine how many companies besides Yahoo were using MD5 in 2013. Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to another former security veteran at Yahoo, even when the company was growing quickly, security sometimes took a back seat as the company focused on system performance to keep up with the growth. Then, when growth stalled, senior security staff left for other companies and the chances of getting approval for expensive upgrades dropped further, the person said. “Any changes to the user database took forever because they were understaffed, and it’s an ultra-critical system - everything depends on it,” said the former Yahoo employee. Yahoo declined to comment on details of its security practices, but said it routinely conducted drills to test and improve its cyber defenses and highlighted campaigns such as a “bug bounty” program in which it pays hackers to find security flaws and report them to the company. Last September, Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyber attack that affected at least 500 million customer accounts, the biggest known data breach at the time. Following last week’s news of the even bigger 2013 breach, U.S. federal investigators and lawmakers said they are scrutinizing Yahoo’s security practices, and Verizon Communications Inc is seeking to renegotiate a July deal to buy Yahoo’s internet business for $4.8 billion. The former Yahoo employees said the company’s security problems began before the arrival of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer in 2012 and continued under her tenure. Yahoo had suffered attacks by Russian hackers for years, two of the former staffers said. In 2014, Yahoo hired a new security chief, Alex Stamos, and one of the security crews he led - known internally as ‘The Paranoids’ - thought they were making headway against the hackers, former employees said. In 2015, when the security crew discovered a hidden program attached to Yahoo’s email servers that was monitoring all incoming messages, their first thought was that the Russian hackers had come back. It turned out that the program had been installed by Yahoo’s email engineers to comply with a secret surveillance order requested by a U.S. intelligence agency, as Reuters previously reported. Stamos and some of his staff left Yahoo soon after that, creating further disruptions to security operations. This week, in addition to disclosing the 2013 hack, Yahoo said someone had accessed its proprietary computer code to learn how to forge “cookies,” which would allow hackers to access an account without passwords. Yahoo said it connected some cookie-forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor it believed was responsible for the 2014 data theft. “They burrowed in and got access to everything,” said Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits. On Thursday, Germany’s cyber security authority criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt adequate encryption techniques and advised German consumers to switch to other email providers. Yahoo told Reuters it was committed to keeping users secure by staying ahead of new threats. “Today’s security landscape is complex and ever-evolving, but, at Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure.” ","

Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

(CHTR) shares have been gaining in recent days, up more than 4.5% so far this week on continued speculation Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) could buy the cable operator. According to media reports, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts at a meeting earlier this week that buying Charter would make “industrial sense.” McAdam didn’t say Verizon was readying a move or considering a deal, nor was Charter Communications expressing interest. The New York Post, citing sources that were present at the meeting, said Verizon would have to raise its level of debt to acquire Charter Communications, which could make a deal a non-starter. What’s more, the same people told the paper it’s not clear if the Trump Administration would support a deal between the two. Charter, which in May purchased Time Warner Cable for $71 billion, has a market capitalization of $78.8 billion. Ever since AT&T Inc.’s move to acquire Time Warner Inc. and launch its own streaming video content service, DirecTV Now, speculation has been swirling about other M&A in the telecom industry. While some industry watchers said Charter could go after a content company, CEO Tom Rutledge poured cold water on that at a recent investor conference. The executive said Charter is happy where it’s at and doesn’t need to buy a content company. But he didn’t rule out making cable acquisitions, pointing out that the incoming Trump Administration appears more open to consolidation. (See also: Comcast Is Launching Netflix on Set-Top Boxes.)

Speaking during the Sohn Conference in London last week, Hohn, who owns shares of Charter, said he thinks the company will be a takeover target given the consolidation going on in the U.S. market, naming Verizon as a bidder. Hohn’s comments echo a similar assessment by RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who recently initiated coverage of Charter with an outperform rating and $325 price target.

""Our recent channel checks suggest US SSS [same-store sales] have improved in recent weeks, allaying fears about difficult compares in 4Q,"" analyst Jason West wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. West's prescient upgrade of McDonald's stock in September 2015 preceded a 23 percent rally in the shares into the end of that year. The upgrade was based on the restaurant's expansion of all-day breakfast.

49,Michael Brush,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:46 a.m. ET Those with high deferred tax liabilities will be the real winners By Many investors are now hunting for companies that pay high U.S. taxes because they stand to benefit the most if Donald Trump cuts corporate taxes, as he said he would. But the real accounting sleuths are looking elsewhere for the hidden gems that may get the biggest boost. They’re digging up the companies that have the largest “deferred tax liabilities” on the books. If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

From current levels, the 2,263 area remains an inflection point, and is followed by the S&P’s all-time high of 2,277.5. (The S&P’s record closing high rests at 2,271.72, and has been challenged early Tuesday.)

                                   is holding the range top. Consider that before Tuesday, the Dow’s all-time closing, and absolute peaks held at 19,911.21, and 19,966.43, respectively. Both areas remain under siege. Conversely, the range bottom matches last week’s low of 19,748. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains technical. As illustrated, the index bottomed twice last week at 5,426, precisely matching first support. Conversely, the Nasdaq’s all-time closing, and intraday peaks, rest at 5,463.83, and 5,486.75 respectively. Separately, the index has staged alternating tests of the range across five straight sessions. Technical price action within an uptrend is bullish. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has sustained the December breakout. First support closely matches the 5,400 mark, and is followed by the 5,340 breakout point. More broadly, the prevailing upturn builds on the steep July rally. An intermediate-term target projects to the 5,570 area. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has taken flight, thus far topping 34 points under the 20,000 mark. Though still near-term extended — and due to consolidate at some point — the prevailing bull flag is a continuation pattern, technically positioning the index for incremental gains. Near-term support matches last week’s close of 19,843, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a deeper floor around 19,750. Similarly, the S&P 500 has established a flag pattern, digesting the December spike. Recall that S&P 2,252 marks near-term support, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a more significant floor at 2,214. Broadly speaking, each major U.S. benchmark has established an orderly five-session range, consolidating slightly under record territory. The muted selling pressure, even after the Federal Reserve’s rate hike last week (and hawkishly revised outlook), is technically constructive. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. Recall that the IWM bottomed last week at 134.81 — slightly above the November peak — an area that pivots to support. Conversely, the all-time closing, and absolute peaks — 138.31, and 138.82, respectively — remain within striking distance. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has staged a flattish pullback from record territory. First support matches last week’s low, fractionally under 303, and is followed by the November peak of 298.77. Conversely, resistance matches the MDY’s all-time highs, technically spanning from 309.09 to 309.59. Widening considerably, to the S&P 500’s three-year view, adds perspective. Each bar on the chart above represents one week. As illustrated, the index has staged two directionally sharp 2016 spikes to uncharted territory. The prevailing late-year rally builds on the initial July Brexit-fueled breakout. The intervening downturn was comparably flat, punctuated by a brief pre-election violation of the 2,131 floor, and the more important 2,117 support. Fast forward to the present, and first support rests at S&P 2,252, an area pinned to price action, and a percentage downturn, detailed last week. This is followed by more significant support at the 2,214 breakout point, and the 2,190 mark, closely matching the December closing low. (Recall that the current leg higher originates from the Dec. 1 close of 2,191, effectively matching major support.) The S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term technical bias points higher barring a violation. Also see: Bull trend confirmed: Charting the approach of Dow 20,000 ahead of the Fed.

The shares subsequently followed through, plunging to record lows after the Federal Reserve’s policy statement. (Very generally, rising U.S. interest rates make the dollar more attractive versus the euro, a backdrop contributing to prevailing trends.) Fast forward to the present, and the euro has ventured closer to parity with the U.S. dollar, pressured amid rising geopolitical tensions, and following the Bank of Japan’s “status quo” policy statement, issued last night.

Image source: Getty Images. At first glance, Sprint (NYSE:S) vs. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) looks like a very simple, natural rivalry. Two of the four nationwide wireless networks, set up in a steel cage, do battle over traditional telecom metrics and issues, and a single survivor leaves the ring victorious. That's actually not how this rivalry works at all. Let's get complicated. First, let me give you a sense of the two companies' relative scale: Metric Verizon Sprint How Much Bigger Is Verizon's Number? Trailing revenue $128 billion $32.4 billion 4 times Net income $14 billion ($1.8 billion) N/A Trailing free cash flow $11.7 billion $2.4 billion 5 times Enterprise value $319 billion $65 billion 5 times Data source: Yahoo! Finance. In short, Sprint can't hold a candle to Verizon's hugeness. In an industry where economies of scale play a deciding role, this is a massive business advantage for Big Red. The company can strike billion-dollar deals without breaking a sweat, take large business risks without betting the farm, and negotiate from a position of cash-backed strength. Meanwhile, Sprint nurses negative earnings and returns on equity under a crushing debt load. The company depends on capital injections from majority owner SoftBank just to keep its network upgrades and other business plans alive. And for the income investors out there, Verizon sports a generous 4.3% dividend yield while Sprint can't afford to spend any cash at all on dividend checks. Knockout in round one, right? Verizon must be the only reasonable choice, thanks to a dominant financial performance. Well, not quite. Sprint investors have enjoyed a thrilling 138% return in 2016. Verizon shareholders had to settle for 16%, or 21% if you include reinvested dividend payments along the way. Market momentum is clearly on Sprint's side, and there are certainly plenty of buyers out there who see value in Sprint shares. Yes, more value than they see in Verizon's stock. In many ways, Sprint is a turnaround gamble. From the end of 2013 to the start of 2016, share prices had fallen a bloodcurdling 66%. The company is in the habit of reporting weak subscriber counts and even weaker bottom-line profits, and that hurts in the long run. This year's bounce rests on a firmer top line and smaller cash losses -- plus the tantalizing possibility of Sprint joining forces with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) to create a third megatelecom. Reports would have it that Sprint wants to buy T-Mobile in a deal financed by SoftBank cash. The Japanese company keeps inviting these rumors only to swat them away once the wild and woolly tales get going. In the latest round of this action, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son promised President-elect Donald Trump to invest $50 billion in the American market, raising the ghost of T-Mobile combination plans again. But the cash is reportedly meant for investment in smaller start-up businesses, not big-ticket buyouts. But that report's boost never faded from Sprint's stock chart, even after dismissing the direct buyout conclusion. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts.

Image source: Getty Images. Though it might seem simple and straightforward, investing in top telecom stocks is far more complex than it initially seems. As we learned in an earlier two-part blueprint for investing in telecom companies, providers of wireless and landline services operate in a multifaceted, highly regulated industry. If you really want to gain an in-depth sense of the industry, I suggest the above two articles as a great starting place. However, as a quick primer, we'll review three of the most important high-level takeaways that anyone considering buying telecom stocks absolutely must consider. When it comes to winning in the telecom space, history shows time and again that size matters. The telecom industry's massive fixed costs -- and the voluminous cash flows they can eventually produce -- allow the companies with the financial resources to invest in their wireless or wireline infrastructure to maintain their competitive positions. Moreover, closing the gap between market leaders and potential challengers requires massive capital expenditures on the insurgents' parts, which can strain companies' balance sheets along the way. Here's a quick example of how this dynamic plays out among U.S. wireless providers, where AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the entrenched incumbents, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) desperately want to steal market share from the former. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash Flow from Operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital Expenditures -$19.2 billion -$17.7 billion -$7.0 billion -$4.7 billion) Free Cash Flow $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending 3/31/16. To me, this is one of the most important charts in explaining the current competitive stance of the U.S. wireless market. Verizon (143 million) and AT&T (133 million) enjoy a roughly 2-to-1 wireless subscriber advantage over T-Mobile (69 million) and Sprint (59 million). As you can see, this larger scale translates into AT&T and Verizon needing to invest a far smaller percentage of their cash from operations into their networks than Sprint or T-Mobile. All of that extra free cash flow gives Verizon and AT&T the ability to invest in opportunities like Verizon's acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!, or AT&T's DIRECTV and Time Warner buyouts. When it comes to the telecom business, it pays to be one of the top dogs over the long term. With well-known names like AT&T and Verizon sporting dividend yields more than double the market average, the telecom industry can be a paradise for income investors. However, chasing yield in this sector can be the siren song of a money-losing investment. Here, a company like rural wireline provider Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) serves as a useful cautionary tale. WIN data by YCharts. In case you've never heard of it, Windstream provides landline telephone, broadband, digital TV, and security services to 1.4 million subscribers across the rural areas of 18 states. Spun out from the now-defunct Alltel in 2006, Windstream's strategy has been to roll up as many rural fiber assets and subscribers as possible to essentially become the biggest fish in an area of the telecom industry that's in structural decline. This ""growth via merger"" model works well on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but it ultimately lies on the losing side of history. The company continues to push forward, recently announcing an all-stock merger with the similar EarthLink. However, with demand for its services declining as our digital world evolves, Windstream's core business strategy appears unsustainable over the long term. What likely first pops out when looking at Windstream is its 8% dividend yield. However, as you saw in the above chart, Windstream's temptingly high dividend yield should more appropriately be viewed as a proxy for its risk. There's a long list to support this truism -- see Alaska Communications Systems or Frontier Communications -- but chasing yield in the telecom space is a quick way for investors to lose their shirts, which segues nicely into the final point on telecom investing. The final telecom investing tip might seem obvious, but given the industry's sneakily diverse mix of companies, investors must understand in detail the business model and strategy of a given company prior to buying. Are they in a growing segment of the industry? Wireless providers and the companies that supply their infrastructure are growing, while older technologies are fading. What does their competitive positioning in that market look like? As we saw with wireless providers, AT&T and Verizon remain far stronger than T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite the wireless space's overall favorable growth characteristics, the benefits of that growth are rarely distributed evenly. At the end of the day, this harkens back to Warren Buffett's concept of a circle of competence. Investors make unintended mistakes when they don't take the time to fully understand any potential investment. The seeming simplicity and sleepiness of the telecom industry can mask the underlying complexity of the sector, much to an investors' detriment. Taking the time to dig into a company's competitive position, its dividend details (if applicable), and its business model and outlook are critical steps that can save investors from making costly missteps or, better still, help identify stocks that can earn investors thousands.

    3 Telecom Investing Tips That Could Earn You Thousands -- The Motley Fool

Image Source: Sprint. About two years ago, Sprint's (NYSE:S) marketing team started breaking out chainsaws and other power tools to promote the wireless carrier's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" offer. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) customers could bring their wireless bills to Sprint, and it would give them a service plan with nearly identical data allotments for half the price they paid at the two larger carriers. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) customers didn't get to join in on the overzealous chainsaw-bill-demolishing fun until last year. But those earliest takers of Sprint's bill-shredding offer are now facing the fact that the promotional pricing is limited to two years. Sprint faces the challenge of moving those customers to its regular pricing without losing them to competitors. Even Sprint knows that pricing is its only differentiating factor. Its newest advertising campaign featuring ""Paul from Verizon"" touts how its network is almost as good as Verizon's and its service costs half the price. When the thousands of Sprint customers who switched over for the Cut Your Bill in Half promotion see their bills increase, they're going to have a hard time rationalizing sticking with Sprint. It will also mark the end of any two-year installment or leasing plans they signed when joining Sprint, providing an optimal time to switch carriers. T-Mobile is trying to move away from being viewed as a low-cost service provider like Sprint to a best-value service provider. It's made a few significant price increases over the last few years with the shift to T-Mobile One -- its unlimited data plan -- being the most noticeable. Still, it's hard to argue that T-Mobile doesn't provide one of the best values in wireless service if it has good coverage in your market. And its coverage is improving significantly with the deployment of its recently acquired 700 MHz spectrum -- which provides better signal strength inside buildings. During T-Mobile's third-quarter earnings call, CEO John Legere noted that it's seeing improved porting ratios with Sprint in the early fourth quarter -- i.e., more Sprint customers are coming to T-Mobile for every customer that's leaving it for Sprint. The other carriers' porting ratios remain stable, indicating the results are largely due to customers leaving Sprint specifically, not anything T-Mobile is doing differently. During the first quarter that Sprint ran its Cut Your Bill in Half promotion, it saw a 20% increase in gross postpaid phone additions year over year. It saw strong double-digit percentage growth in postpaid phone gross additions for the next few quarters, although management would often obscure exact details in their earnings releases. The point is, the promotion worked in that it attracted a lot of new customers to Sprint. The problem currently is that those customers are now about to experience a rate hike -- if they haven't already. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk expects Sprint's postpaid phone gross additions growth will decline to just 1.7% in the fourth quarter from 18.7% last year. He also sees subscriber churn increasing to 1.53% from 1.37% last quarter. As such, Sprint can expect to see continued declines in average revenue per user and slowing postpaid subscriber growth. The result is a likely return to net revenue declines after just breaking out of a two-year slide last quarter. ","
      
    1 Big Reason Sprint Subscribers Might Start Leaving -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Investors have likely heard a lot about the Internet of Things (IoT). The term refers to the connection of formerly unconnected things to the Internet, so that they can collect data or automate processes. A smartwatch is an IoT device, and so is an Internet-connected tractor that knows how many seeds have been planted, and where. The IoT's broad applications have made it a favorite among some investors, and there are plenty of companies to choose from in the space. But is now a good time to invest? To help answer that question, let's take a look at a few key developments happening in the IoT space right now. Japanese telecom giant SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF) recently purchased the British chipmaker ARM Holdings for nearly $32 billion, mostly based on ARM's position in the IoT. SoftBank's billionaire CEO, Masayoshi Son, had this to say about the importance of IoT in the acquisition: ""First there was the internet, then the mobile internet and next there will be the internet of things, which is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history. I'm making this investment at the very beginning of this shift."" SoftBank's purchase of ARM was the company's largest acquisition, the biggest Japanese acquisition in Europe, and one of the largest acquisitions of 2016. The company is betting that ARM's IoT chip designs will be just as popular as ARM's tech has been in smartphones. But SoftBank isn't the only telecom betting on the IoT. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is already making inroads in the IoT space in the U.S. with its Hum automotive telematics service and its upcoming 5G network. The former allows drivers to add an internet-enabled device to their car's onboard diagnostics connection and pair it with an app that tracks how fast the car is going, monitors if it leaves a specified boundary, and provides maintenance reminders. But the real opportunity is in Verizon bringing an IoT-specific network online, to allow the billions future IoT devices to come online. Verizon's vice president of technology planning, Adam Koeppe, said in an interview earlier in 2016 that the ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies -- traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself -- that's where 5G comes into play."" The company says that 5G will be the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and will bring part of the 5G network online sometime in 2017, with more expansion after that. Companies have been building out IoT platforms for developers for a few years now, but the number of platforms is increasing and their capabilities are expanding. Take Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for example. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been around for a while now, but the company is continually releasing new IoT platforms that help developers connect to it. Amazon's latest IoT platform, called Greengrass, debuted earlier this month and allows developers to set a single hub device to receive data from multiple low-energy devices and transmit the data to the cloud for those devices. All of this allows small IoT devices to conserve energy yet still collect data to be analyzed. That's just one small part of Amazon's broad-based IoT focus, but it's another example of the company building IoT platforms that tie directly into its AWS. That's good news for the company as it expands its AWS revenue, which was $3.2 billion in the third quarter. Amazon isn't the only one going down this path, of course. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has built out several iterations of IoT platforms, and just released its newest one, called Android Things. This version allows developers to build on Android APIs and connect with the company's new Google Assistant. Google has already released several different IoT plaforms (Android@Home and Brillo), but Android Things is already starting to gain traction, with Belkin, WeMo, and Honeywell already signing up. The benefit for Google is the same as with Amazon's IoT platform: If Google can get more developers to use its protocol when building IoT applications, then it might be able to host those devices on its cloud services as well. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) strong position in the mobile space is undeniable, but as sales of smartphones slow down, even this mobile juggernaut is looking to the IoT for new opportunities. The company made a $37 billion bid for chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) in October and expects the purchase to boost its IoT prospects. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf commented on the acquisition's potential during a conference call: ""Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies. Our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments."" Qualcomm will use the NXP purchase to enter the growing semi-autonomous car market, while benefiting from NXP's IoT position in the near-field communication and radio-frequency identification spaces as well. Qualcomm says that after the deal closes on NXP, the company will earn about 30% of its total revenue from the Internet of Things and automotive segments, up from about 8% right now. ","

56,Selena Maranjian,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With fewer and fewer of us able to enjoy traditional pension income, it's more important than ever that we plan for our future financial security and set ourselves up to receive sufficient income when we're no longer working. Here are 10 ways you can boost your retirement income. Image source: Getty Images. You can accumulate a lot of money in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Traditional (not Roth) IRAs and 401(k)s receive pre-tax contributions. So, if you have taxable income of $75,000 and you contribute $5,000, you get to subtract that from your taxable income and avoid paying taxes on it now (you will ultimately be taxed on it upon withdrawal in retirement, when your tax rate may be lower). If you're in the 25% tax bracket and contribute $10,000 to these accounts, you'll cut your tax bill by $2,500! Roth varieties of these accounts offer no upfront tax break, but if you follow the rules, you can withdraw from them in retirement tax-free. Here's how much you might be able to accumulate over time: Growing at 8% for $5,000 Invested Annually $10,000 Invested Annually $15,000 Invested Annually 15 years $146,621 $293,243 $439,864 20 years $247,115 $494,229 $741,344 25 years $394,772 $789,544 $1.2 million 30 years $611,729 $1.2 million $1.8 million Calculations by author. A good way to have more income in retirement is to have no mortgage payments due every month. It's smart to pay off your mortgage before retiring, if you can. If you're still some years away from retiring, consider making extra payments in order to reduce your balance. It could even make sense to refinance to a 15-year loan if that will help you pay the house off sooner. Image source: Pixabay. Another option, though one with some significant drawbacks, is a reverse mortgage. With a reverse mortgage, you essentially borrow money based on your home equity and you don't have to pay it back until you die or stop living in your home. It can deliver a welcome income stream -- and a tax-free one at that, generally -- but it can mean your heirs don't get to inherit your home. Learn more about reverse mortgages if you're interested. You have to qualify for one, you may not get as much income as you'd hoped, and you'll face closing costs, but it's still a good solution for some people. Buying an annuity is a lot like buying yourself a pension. Stick with fixed annuities (that pay immediately or later), and think twice about variable or indexed annuities -- as those can have steep fees and restrictive terms and limits on growth. For $200,000, a 70-year-old couple might get an immediate fixed annuity that pays around $1,000 per month for as long as at least one of them is alive. A 70-year-old woman who spends $100,000 may get about $577 per month (that's around $6,900 per year), vs. $641 for a 70-year-old man (about $7,700 per year). Women will usually receive less because they tend to live longer than men. A fixed annuity can provide peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to your health insurance, spend some time reading up on the topic so you can get the most bang for your buck. Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in stocks and bonds -- and staying invested throughout retirement -- can generate interest and dividend income for you. Remember that even at age 70, you might have another 20 years ahead of you, so it's not crazy to have some of your nest egg in stocks. A $300,000 portfolio of dividend-paying stocks with an average yield of 4% can deliver $12,000 in annual income -- plus the payouts are likely to increase over time as long as the companies remain healthy and growing. Here are some recent yields to give you an idea of what's out there: Stock Recent Dividend Yield AT&T 4.7% Verizon Communications 4.4% General Motors 4.2% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.6% IBM 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Johnson & Johnson 2.8% Microsoft 2.5% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Image source: Getty Images. Another good way to increase your income in retirement is to stay at your job for a few more years than you originally planned. That lets you keep adding to your retirement accounts -- and a fatter nest egg can generate more income. It can also keep you on your employer's health insurance plan a bit longer, possibly saving you some money for a few years, and it delays your starting to withdraw funds from your savings to live off of. If you don't want to keep working full time for a few more years, you might start your retirement by only partially withdrawing from the work force. A part-time job, for example, can keep some money flowing in during your early retirement years, boosting your income. It can also be a good way to transition into full retirement, which can be jarring for some people, with the lack of routines and the big drop-off in socializing. Even working 12 hours per week at $10 per hour can generate $120 per week -- $6,240 per year -- in extra retirement income. There are lots of other ways to boost your retirement income, some of which might not occur to many people. For example, you might rent out a room to a boarder, or just take in occasional guests as an Airbnb host. You might become an online tutor in any subjects you know well, or you might turn a hobby into a profit center, perhaps selling soaps, jewelry, sweaters, or furniture you make. You might move to a smaller, less expensive home, or perhaps even to a less expensive part of the country. If you and your spouse each have a vehicle, consider downsizing to just one, if you can swing it. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, remember that the income many of us are counting on in retirement -- Social Security -- is something you can control, to some degree. The average Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,350 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,639 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. (For example, you could start collecting the lower-earner's benefits first while letting the higher-earner's benefits grow larger.) Putting just a few of the strategies above into use can significantly boost your retirement income. ","

Or maybe buy into Trump’s defense-spending plans? Or even bet on one of Europe’s most hated airlines? According to a group of top fund managers, those plays are likely to offer you some of the best returns for the next year. Speaking at the Sohn Conference in London earlier in December, 14 fund managers from the U.S. and Europe each unveiled their top investment calls for the next year to a group of around 450 investors. How to benefit from president-elect Donald Trump’s expected fiscal policies was a major topic at the conference, but continued optimism over the commodity sector also featured highly among fund-manager favorites. Here’s a list of some of the most interesting calls from the annual conference: Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC

Croxson points to two key factors behind his Ryanair call: 1) The company’s cost structure is significantly lower than other airlines, including rival easyJet PLC

Ryanair is already Europe’s largest airline with a market share pf around 15%, but with an expanded route network to more popular airports coupled with continued low prices, Croxson expects the airline to control 25% of the European market in coming years.

Autoliv already sits on 38% of the market, but is almost guaranteed to grow its share to 50% due to serious problems at its main competitor Takata Corp.

Since those events, Autoliv has won 55% of all new orders, which means the market share should start to accelerate in the second half of 2017 and well into 2019, the Bodenholm fund manager said.

See: Lockheed’s stock drops after Trump tweets about ‘out of control’ jet costs What makes Leonardo stand out in the industry, she said, is its rise from the ashes under new CEO Mauro Moretti that has succeeded with a much-needed restructuring program. She estimates the stock has potential to rally to €24.30 in coming years, a more than 80% upside from the €13.49 it currently trades at. “If you’re looking for a deep-value cyclical, which has been penalized for being Italian — although only 15% of its revenue comes from Italy — which benefits from the secular trend of increased spending in defense, which will also benefit from a cyclical upturn in the helicopter market, a fantastic management team and [huge] upside, I suggest you take a look at Leonardo,” she said.

61,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

63,Mark Hulbert,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

64,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

He called the major telecom stocks “a steal” on Dec. 5: And on Jan. 11 he told MarketWatch he would still buy them, even though they had risen since Dec. 5.

According to FactSet, the company’s free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

65,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:50 a.m. ET A deep dive yields generous income-producing stocks coupled with some downside protection By Income-hungry investors continue to flock to stocks over bonds, where yields, while rising, remain relatively low. But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits. And if a high dividend-payer’s sales and profits are also increasing, so much the better. Meanwhile, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds range from 75 to 150 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasury notes

This left us with 164 stocks. We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

66,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:51 a.m. ET Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings values and high rates of earnings growth By In a recent interview, Erick Ormsby, the founder of Alcosta Capital Management, looked ahead by a year and based several stock picks on companies expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2018. The companies were also trading at relatively low price-to-forward earnings valuations.

                                    SPX, -0.16% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade. (As always, gold and the U.S. dollar are inversely correlated.)

                                   has extended its recovery attempt, rising amid Brexit-related currency cross currents. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has confirmed on Tuesday that Britain will leave the European Union, but via a phased transition. Technically, the FXE has reached one-month highs, rising to challenge the 50-day moving average, currently 103.30. A sustained break higher opens the path to major resistance, circa 104.90, an area matching the bottom of the November gap.

68,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"The news stoked speculation about the future of the T-Mobile-Sprint tie-up, and also about other potential merger partners for T-Mobile. Analysts have said that the telecoms and cable sectors are primed for a wave of deal activity, and executives have openly talked about potential mergers. If the talks with Charter and Comcast fail, Sprint’s negotiating position could weaken if it were to restart merger talks with T-Mobile, JPMorgan analysts said. T-Mobile’s shares fell 3.3 percent on Tuesday to $61.06, while Dish shares were up 0.3 percent at $64.02. Sprint shares were last up 2.7 percent at $8.22. Analysts have speculated that Dish, a satellite TV provider that has been buying up wireless spectrum, could be an attractive acquisition target for both Verizon and T-Mobile. Sprint’s talks to provide the backbone for a wireless network for Comcast and Charter serve as a “three-way hedge” for the companies, said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “From a game theory perspective, this is a fascinating move,” Moffett wrote in an email. The two cable companies are hedging for a possible tie-up between Sprint and T-Mobile that could reduce their negotiating leverage, and the wireless deal also allows Sprint to hedge against the risk that a merger with T-Mobile never happens, Moffett said. A wireless deal with Comcast and Charter would also give Sprint more bargaining leverage if it does secure a tie-up with T-Mobile, he added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the negotiations between the companies on Monday, said Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. A minority equity investment was being discussed but that may not be part of any deal, sources told Reuters. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources said. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May in a bid to offset customer attrition as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast also already has an MVNO agreement with Sprint that stems from the cable company’s 2008 investment in Clearwire Corp. A source familiar with the matter said Comcast would seek better terms for that agreement given the highly competitive nature of the wireless business and technological changes in the past nine years. MVNOs do not own networks, and instead rent capacity from established operators to sell on to their customers, usually at low prices due to their small overheads, with cheap distribution through the internet or convenience stores. The cable companies’ agreement with Verizon restricts them to offer wireless within their own service areas, while a deal with Sprint could allow them to offer the service nationally. Verizon shares were down 1.6 percent on Tuesday at $44.97. ","

69,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"WILMINGTON, Del./BOSTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp used confidential information from its alliance with RadioShack Corp to open competing mobile phone stores, dooming the comeback by the electronics retailer and destroying jobs, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by RadioShack creditors. RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack’s official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. The lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack’s best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States. Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States. ","

70,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added. One of the sources said that a minority equity investment was being discussed but that it may not be part of any deal. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources added. Sprint, Comcast and Charter declined to comment. An agreement with the cable providers over its network does not mean Sprint may not also seek a merger agreement with T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, the sources said. Sprint sees the partnership as increasing competition in the market, which should help alleviate any antitrust concerns over a merger with T-Mobile, the source added. Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion. Three years ago, Sprint ended a previous round of talks to acquire T-Mobile amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. ","

71,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders. The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump’s effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the government’s computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week. “We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs,” Trump told the executives on Thursday. “We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.” In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc. Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

72,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of $750 million senior unsecured notes due 2027. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt, including debt under its 2013 and 2014 revolving credit facilities. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, pro forma outstanding borrowings on AMT's RCFs totalled approximately $2.9 billion. The pro forma amount reflects the net repayment of approximately $95 million on is 2013 credit facility subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017. AMT currently has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong FCF and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently around 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain relatively stable margins. Tower revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: At March 31, 2017, net leverage was 5.0x, and Fitch expects AMT's net leverage to decline slightly to under 5.0x at the end of 2017. Leverage has gradually declined following AMT's acquisitions over the last couple of years, including the acquisition of the rights to towers and outright purchases of towers from Verizon Communications Inc. in 2015. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur, would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international operations generated approximately 34% of total property revenues in the first quarter of 2017. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --In 2017, consolidated revenue grows to approximately $6.6 billion, based on expectations for property revenue to be near the mid-point of company guidance of $6.5 billion. In 2018 and thereafter, Fitch assumes revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2017 due to the lower margins associated with acquired properties but increase moderately thereafter as additional tenants are added to towers. --Capital spending of approximately $850 million in 2017. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF, cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2016, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was approximately $1 billion. As of March 31, 2017, cash approximated $713 million and unused revolver capacity was approximately $1.77 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $564 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility due in January 2022 (the 2014 RCF) and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June 2020 (the 2013 RCF). The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x (up to 7.0x for specified time periods following a qualified acquisition). The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. There are no material maturities in 2017, and approximately $1.5 billion matures in 2018. Contact: Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

73,Alan Farley,6292017,Investopedia,6222017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Nasdaq-100​ component Altaba Inc. (AABA) holds the balance of the remaining Yahoo assets, including 15.4% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), following Verizon Communications Inc.'s (VZ) partial acquisition. The newly minted $52 billion market cap seems pricey, but no one really knows the value of this corporate hodgepodge or how it's going to grow in the coming years. Technically speaking, the stock is well positioned for gains through the rest of 2017 because the new entity has adopted Yahoo's long-term chart, yielding a timely breakout above the 2014 high at $52.62. While it's easy to second guess this glued-together reporting, consider that other big caps including United States Steel Corporation (X) and AT&T Inc. (T) have also sewn together bits and pieces of newly acquired operations or divestitures into multi-decade price charts. (See also: What Is Altaba Anyway?) AABA Long-Term Chart (1996 – 2017) The former company came public at $1.49 (after adjustment for five stock splits) in April 1996 and fell into a downtrend that found support near 65 cents. It then entered a powerful trend advance driven by the awakening of the net bubble, rising to an all-time high at $125.03 in March 2000. The subsequent downtrend relinquished the majority of the prior decade's dramatic gains, dropping the stock more than 97% to $4.01 at the end of 2002. The subsequent uptrend topped out at $43.66 in January 2006, highlighting severe technical damage because the rally failed to reach the .386 Fibonacci bear market retracement level. A pullback into 2008 accelerated during the economic collapse, dropping the stock back into the single digits for the second time in six years. It underperformed badly after hitting a bottom in November 2008, stuck in a narrow trading range bounded by resistance in the upper teens. The stock took off in the strongest buying impulse so far this decade in the second half of 2012, breaking out above the 2006 high in October 2014 before topping out in the low $50s a few weeks later. It then entered a steep correction that found support in the upper $20s in early 2016, ahead of an equally strong bounce that reached within a few points of the prior high in May 2017, just a few weeks before this month's post-acquisition breakout. (For more, see: Verizon Officially Now Owns Yahoo, Mayer Resigns.) AABA Short-Term Chart (2015 – 2017) The sell-off into 2016 unfolded through an Elliott five-wave decline, perfectly aligned with bearish action throughout the tech universe during that period. The stock tested the September 2015 low at $27.20 in February 2016, broke down and then rallied strongly, setting off a 2B buy signal that denotes the failure of bears to hold new resistance. Rumors about a company sale or divestiture generated speculative buying interest into September, when it disclosed high-profile hacking incidents that raised questions about the company's valuation. (For more, see: Yahoo Confirms Massive Data Breach.) On-balance volume (OBV) topped out in 2014 and entered a persistent distribution wave that ended four months before the price bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016. This bullish divergence contributed to steady buying interest that reached a new high ahead of the Verizon sale. The transaction triggered high-volume price bars and a sharp indicator downturn to a nine-month low, signaling aggressive profit taking as well as new purchases. The OBV downturn tells us that the stock needs to rebuild previously loyal sponsorship to continue the 16-month uptrend. However, the price remains in breakout mode, and it makes sense to ignore recent signals because they're unfolding right at the interface between the two corporate identities. In other words, this seemingly bearish activity could reflect the natural rotation from one set of shareholder hands to another. (See also: On-Balance Volume: The Way to Smart Money.) Altaba came to life after Yahoo sold key assets to Verizon, with the new entity using the parent's long-term chart. The split has triggered a major breakout undermined by a bearish volume signal, but we'll ignore that red flag for now, given broad tech strength and confusion about the new entity's legitimate supply and demand.

(AABA), the remnant of Yahoo after the core internet assets were sold to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), announced the final results of its modified Dutch auction to purchase up to $3 billion of shares with the company spending $3.4 billion. The company said Thursday a total of 64,514,767 shares of its stock were tendered at or below the final purchase price of $53.20 a share. Altaba said it accepted the purchase price and spent about $3.4 billion to buy back the shares. The $3.4 billion excludes fees and expenses related to the tender offer and represents around 6.7% of the shares outstanding as of June 20. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) In May, Yahoo announced the Dutch auction, saying then the price would not be less than $37 a share and that its directors and executive officers will not tender any shares in the buyback. The company started trading this week under the name Altaba, which is a play on the world ""alternative"" and Alibaba (BABA), in which it has a 15% stake, valued at around $341 billion. Recently, shares of Altaba were trading up 0.53%, or $0.28 to $55.34. The stock has been gaining all week as investors view it as a cheaper way to get a piece of Alibaba Group, the Chinese ecommerce giant. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, Yahoo warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. Investors also get access to a stake in Yahoo Japan valued at $7.7 billion by owning shares of Altaba. The company also has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon. Leading the new company is Yahoo board member Thomas McInerney, formerly the chief financial officer for IAC/InterActiveCorp. (which owns Investopedia), who has been on the board since 2012 and sat on the independent board committee charged with selling Yahoo’s core internet assets. McInerney will get base salary of $2 million annually and incentive pay based on performance goals.  ",Altaba Spends $3.5B on its Shares in Dutch Auction | Investopedia,0.9909

78,Leo Sun,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Telecom stocks are popular with income investors because they offer high yields and steady growth and their moats are tough for new competitors to cross. But with so many telco stocks on the market, it can be hard to identify the best plays. Let's take a closer look at three of my personal favorites -- AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and BCE (NYSE:BCE). AT&T pays a forward dividend yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend annually for over three decades. It spent 95% of its earnings and 70% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so it can easily keep raising its dividend for the foreseeable future. Image source: Pixabay. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's the largest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If its proposed takeover of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles, it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. AT&T is bundling these services together in lucrative packages to lock in customers. Its wireless customers, for example, can stream content from DirecTV and its ""sponsored data"" partners without the usage counting toward their data plans. It also recently bundled Time Warner's HBO channels with its unlimited wireless plans. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year and for its earnings to rise 2%. Those are lackluster growth figures, but the stock trades at just 19 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. Verizon also pays a forward yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend for 10 straight years. It spent 76% of its earnings on those dividends over the past 12 months. However, Verizon's free cash flow also dipped into the red over the past year -- partly due to its buyout of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014 and its subsequent purchases of AOL and Yahoo's internet business. Data source: YCharts. Verizon merged those two aging businesses into a new company called Oath, led by former AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Armstrong recently claimed that the new media platform would attract over 10 million creators for 2 billion customers and generate between $10 billion to $20 billion in annual revenues -- which would represent 12% of Verizon's 2016 revenue at the midpoint. Verizon plans to bundle all of these internet and media properties into its own wireless and wireline ecosystem. Like AT&T, it's using sponsored data to lock in customers with data-free streaming -- a strategy that both telcos hope will offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless customers. Analysts see Verizon's revenue and earnings both slipping 3% this year on the slowdown of its core wireless business and its increased investments in its ecosystem. However, both figures are expected to turn positive next year, and the stock remains cheaper than AT&T at 15 times earnings. BCE, formerly known as Bell Canada Enterprises, is the largest telecom company in Canada. It generates most of its revenue from internet, phone, and TV packages, but also generates additional revenue from investments in media outlets, real estate holdings, and professional sport teams. BCE pays a forward dividend yield of 4.8%, and it's hiked that dividend on an annualized basis for two straight years. It spent 83% of its earnings and 87% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so its payout looks very sustainable. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, BCE is posting steady growth in wireless postpaid subscribers, which is only partly offset by its weaker prepaid growth. Its wireline business also continues growing, thanks to the strength of its internet and TV businesses. Analysts expect BCE's revenue to rise 4% this year, but its earnings are expected to slip 1% -- partly due to its recent takeover of Manitoba Telecom Services. But above all, BCE isn't copying AT&T's and Verizon's strategies of expanding their media ecosystems or divesting their wireline businesses. So if you're looking for a simpler telco with fewer moving parts, BCE -- which trades at a reasonable 18 times earnings -- might fit the bill. ","

79,Andrew Tonner,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Comparing American telecom players Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) to one another is like comparing the Major Leagues to Triple-A. They technically play the same sport, but they operate at entirely different scales. Thankfully, in the investing world, stocks of all shapes and sizes can make for potential buys; we're equal-opportunity investors here at the Fool. So keeping that in mind, let's look at CenturyLink and Verizon across three important categories to determine which company looks like the more appealing investment today. As a baseline, investors need to first understand the financial stability of any prospective investment before digging into its broader growth and valuation narratives. To guide this analysis, let's look at four metrics to get a sense of how Verizon and CenturyLink stack up in terms of liquidity and solvency. Company Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio CenturyLink $214 million $19.6 billion $4.2 billion 0.9 Verizon $4.3 billion $116.8 billion $16.9 billion 1.0 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The aforementioned difference in scale between the two comes into sharper contrast here. However, it should also jump out that, though they differ quite dramatically in absolute size, CenturyLink and Verizon share fairly similar capital structure and cash flow generation profiles. The two companies share virtually identical current ratios. Beyond that, CenturyLink carries just 1.1% of its total debt load in cash and investments, whereas Verizon holds 2.6% of its borrowings in liquid assets -- not much difference there. Alternatively, CenturyLink's 12-month cash flow from operations represents 21.4% of its total debt, whereas Verizon's cash flows only account for 10.1% of its $116.8 billion in debt. Granted, Verizon enjoys an investment-grade credit rating versus CenturyLink's non-investment-grade rating, so Verizon's cost of borrowing is likely lower. However, since the two share so much in common in terms of their financial footprint, it seems fairest to call this section a tie and move on. Image Source: Getty Images. Here's where the differences between the two start to really hit home. As the largest wireless provider in the U.S., Verizon's business model is largely predicated on providing wireless services to consumers and businesses -- $89 billion of its $125 billion in fiscal 2016 revenue came from wireless. Though the U.S. wireless market is no longer growing as fast as it once was, the space is generally stable. Alongside the other U.S. wireless monolith AT&T, Verizon's massive financial resources should allow it to effectively compete against continued competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. Moreover, the company is attempting to align itself with the broader trends in the wireless industry, most notably by buying its way into mobile advertising via its AOL and Yahoo acquisitions. For the record, I like AT&T's growth strategy more, but there's little reason to fret over Verizon's long-term place as a central player in this space. CenturyLink, on the other hand, finds itself in a slightly more precarious situation. In fact, $7.6 billion of the company's $17.4 billion in 2016 sales come from what CenturyLink calls its legacy services segment, which mostly consists of landline phone services for companies and consumers. As the company itself notes, this business is expected to remain in secular decline as the use of landline phones continues to dwindle. The remaining majority of CenturyLink's revenue comes from providing broadband and other data connectivity services to companies and individuals, which isn't necessarily a growth market either. The company hopes to shore up its competitive position via its pending merger with Level 3 Communications. The $34 billion deal should help expand CenturyLink's presence in the broadband service market and provide considerable cost savings. To be clear, this move is undoubtedly a smart one. However, it doesn't change the company's fundamental problem that it is largely tied to competitive markets that seem likely to decline over time. Looking to the final section of our analysis, let's start by reviewing three popular valuation metrics for Verizon and CenturyLink. Company P/E Forward P/E P/Cash Flow CenturyLink 15.6 12.2 12.3 Verizon 25.2 12.5 11.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar. Chart by author. Let's also tie in analysts' consensus growth estimates here to provide a bit more context about each company's valuation. Wall Street expects Verizon's sales to decline 2.7% this year and grow 0.5% next year. For CenturyLink, the analyst community sees its sales falling 5.4% this year and 1.8% next year. In this light, Verizon's higher current P/E starts to appear more favorable, and its forward multiples seem more enticing. Lastly, any discussion of these two telecom names would be remiss without looking at their dividends, one of the hallmarks of telecom investing. Verizon currently pays out a comparatively lower 4.9% dividend, and its dividend payout ratio stands at 76% of net income. CenturyLink pays out an 8.5% dividend with a 211% dividend yield, which seems rather aggressive. Ultimately, a safer dividend can be better than a higher yield. Verizon wins this final portion of our analysis. Apologies to the CenturyLink fans in the crowd, but Verizon is simply a higher quality business in terms of its current strategy, its size within the space, its growth outlook, and the sustainability of its dividend. To be sure, CenturyLink's Level 3 buyout should help the company improve the efficiency of its operations. However, in thinking about which company you see thriving over the long term, Verizon is the clear winner in this matchup of telecom industry powers. ","

There are some stocks you couldn't persuade me to buy if they were the last tickers on the market. They are headed toward extinction-level events and are hardly worth the electrons their digital stock certificates are printed on. For me, that list includes fading retailer Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), near-forgotten smartphone veteran BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and regional telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). Your list of blackball stocks may be different; read on to see why I'm staying away from these tickers. Image source: Getty Images. Frontier Communications has a habit of picking up the landline and FiOS operations that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) doesn't want to deal with anymore. Two large Verizon deals in 2010 and 2016 have more than quintupled Frontier's annual sales in seven years, yet they didn't help Frontier's earnings or free cash flows at all. Furthermore, the company's debt balances rose from $4.8 billion to $17.9 billion and annual interest expenses quadrupled to $1.5 billion. Lacking the large cash flows you'd expect from a mature telecom company, Frontier is cutting its dividend to help finance the debt-servicing costs. And management has not shown much concern for long-term shareholders, either -- the Verizon deals involved both new debt and a massive load of new Frontier shares going into the hands of Verizon's owners. Share prices have reacted as one might expect under this campaign of creative value destruction: FTR data by YCharts This is not a turnaround story just waiting to be told. It's a long, slow death march under the yoke of expensive and unprofitable wireline operations. I suppose the FiOS portion of Frontier's Verizon transactions could have worked out, since high-speed internet connections have worked wonders for other cable and telecom operators in recent years. But even there, Frontier is losing customers quarter by quarter and data service revenue keeps falling. I don't see a happy ending to Frontier's gloomy story. Not now, not in 10 years, not until the company completely shakes up its business model to come up with something that works. Failing that, this stock is going to zero in the long run. Once upon a time, BlackBerry was synonymous with ""smartphones."" High-quality physical keyboards made the company's devices a joy to use for secure text messaging and basic web browsing. Then Apple and the Android gang showed up with their sleek touchscreens and massive app stores. The smartphone game changed overnight, and BlackBerry never managed to find a foothold in the new market. This chart speaks volumes of BlackBerry's fading fortunes: BBRY data by YCharts BlackBerry CEO John Chen is turning the former smartphone giant into a very different business. The Canadian company is now all about secure messaging apps and data security tools. Best of luck, but BlackBerry burned a ton of credibility years ago. Any success the company finds at this point must be built from scratch, not resurrected from the glory days. This turnaround effort is a risky proposition, and it's easy enough to find better investments elsewhere. BlackBerry simply doesn't belong in my portfolio. Finally, I can't think of a single company more obviously headed to the scrap heap of history than Sears Holdings. The mall-based store chain started circling the drain long before Frontier or BlackBerry, and there's no going back: SHLD data by YCharts Kmart and Sears stores are closing their doors by the hundreds, the company is selling off real estate assets and household-name product brands to stay afloat, and billionaire CEO Eddie Lampert was forced to prop the balance sheet up with cash from his own pockets, since banks are no longer interested in doing business with Sears. I don't even have to aim my laser pointer at Sears to see it crumble. This company is falling apart on its own, and I don't want anything to do with it.

Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) is a company firing on all cylinders. In its 2017 first quarter results, all five of its business segments saw year-over-year revenue growth. Four of the five divisions-Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences-realized double-digit earnings increases over the previous year's results. Investors in the company have been rewarded for its performance as shares are up 47% over the past year. Yet, while the rally in Corning's shares has been fueled by a broad-based rise in the company's various business segments, it is the fast growth of two, in particular, that might have investors most excited. These divisions, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials, just scored major deals that highlight the opportunities of the industries they each compete in and the large macro trends that might drive further growth for years to come. GLW data by YCharts In the company's most recently reported quarter, its Optical Communications division saw sales of $818 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, and core earnings of $93 million, a whopping 258% year-over-year increase. This division supplies optical fiber to major telecom companies and internet service providers. With the need to upgrade their networks to meet the requirements of 5G soon, the demand for optical fiber isn't going away. Verizon agreed to purchase more than $1 billion of optical fiber from Corning over the next three years. Image source: Corning Incorporated. That's why it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Corning landed such a huge deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) mere days before the company reported its first-quarter earnings. The deal committed Verizon to purchase more than $1 billion in ""optical solutions"" over the next three years which translates to about 20 million kilometers of optical fiber that Corning will supply Verizon annually for the duration of the contract. Corning's CEO Wendell Weeks said the company could sell even more fiber to companies if it had additional manufacturing capacity. As Weeks succinctly put it in the company's first quarter conference call, ""If we had more, we could sell more."" For this reason, Corning is investing in additional optical fiber capacity, which is factored into the company's four-year plan of capital expenditure spending of $6-7 billion. Because of the company's ability to expand its capacity for manufacturing optical fiber, Weeks said he expects the company to grow ""significantly faster than the optical markets we serve."" If all goes according to plan, Corning's shareholders should expect to see further success in this segment. During the conference call, Weeks sounded especially optimistic when he stated: Stepping back, all of our customers have the opportunity to benefit from our unique set of capabilities in Optical Communications. We are engaged in deep dialogue with major telecom players across the globe as they anticipate transformations in communications, education, healthcare, transportation, and ultimately, the way that we all live. Corning's Optical Communications market access platform, essential to realizing their vision, because of our ability to economically expand capacity and deliver innovative solutions. In early May, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook announced the inception of his company's one billion dollar Advanced Manufacturing Fund to spur innovation among American manufacturers. Just weeks later, Apple announced Corning would receive $200 million as the fund's first recipient. The money will go to Corning's Harrodsburg, KY facility where it manufactures Gorilla Glass. Corning scientists produce Gorilla Glass, the glass that is used for iPhones and iPads. Image source: Corning Incorporated. Gorilla Glass is Corning's proprietary state-of-the-art glass that covers most of the world's smartphones and tablets, including every iPhone and iPad ever made. In the first quarter, the business segment saw sales of $300 million and core earnings of $48 million, respective 32% and 50% year-over-year increases. Gorilla Glass 5, the latest and greatest iteration of the specialty glass, has seen a more rapid adoption than previous generations of Gorilla Glass which has translated into gains in price premiums and market share for Corning. With more and more major smartphone manufacturers using glass on the front and backs of their products, it's little surprise that Apple would take such an interest in the glass manufacturing process just before a major product release of its own. Neither optical fiber, which is the backbone of the world's connectivity, or Gorilla Glass, the medium we touch to connect to the rest of the world, are going away anytime soon. The recent deal with Verizon and investment by Apple highlight the many opportunities ahead for Corning in these two growth segments. ","

IBM (NYSE:IBM) has disappointed plenty of investors, including Warren Buffett, with 20 straight quarters of annual revenue declines and a 20% haircut in its market value over the past five years. But as I discussed in previous articles, Big Blue's low valuation and high dividend should limit the stock's downside potential. IBM pays a forward yield of 3.9%, which is almost double the S&P 500's average yield of 2%. That dividend is supported by a low payout ratio of 46%, which gives it plenty of room to continue its 22 straight years of annual dividend hikes. Source: Getty. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, pays a slightly higher forward yield of 4%. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 71%, and Qualcomm has raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years. Source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm initially seems to have worse growth prospects than IBM, with analysts expecting its revenue and earnings to respectively fall 3% and 4% this year. Those declines are attributed to its loss of market share in mobile chipsets to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from bigger smartphone makers, and an OEM revolt against its high-margin wireless licensing fees. It's also dealing with a series of antitrust probes and lawsuits -- which claim that it leveraged its wireless patent portfolio to push competitors out of the market and secure exclusive deals. But looking ahead, Qualcomm is also expected to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in the near future, which would diversify its business away from the troubled mobile market, grow its addressable markets by 40% by 2020, and make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world. The deal is also expected to be ""significantly accretive"" to its non-GAAP earnings once it closes. I believe that's a better turnaround strategy than waiting around for IBM's ""strategic imperatives"" growth to finally pay off. Investors who think Qualcomm looks too risky should consider buying telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), which pays a forward yield of 5.1% and has hiked its dividend annually for over three decades -- making it a ""dividend aristocrat,"" a company that has hiked its payout for over 25 straight years. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 95%. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's also the biggest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its acquisition of DirecTV in 2015. It will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world after its proposed acquisition of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles. AT&T's flagship store in San Francisco. Source: AT&T. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year, and for its earnings to rise 2%. However, those estimates don't include the Time Warner deal, which could become accretive to AT&T's earnings and free cash flow within the first year, and generate $1 billion in annual run rate cost synergies within the first three years. In addition to offering higher yields and more exciting long-term growth prospects than IBM, Qualcomm and AT&T are also fundamentally cheap. Qualcomm trades at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 25 for semiconductor companies. AT&T trades at 19 times earnings, versus the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. So before you buy IBM for its dividend, take a closer look at Qualcomm and AT&T to see if they better suit your income investing needs. I personally own both stocks as long-term income plays, and I'm not losing any sleep over either one. ","

83,Daniel B. Kline,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. That's an old saying, but it's one that most people keep in mind when they evaluate the latest offer from a cable company, internet service provider (ISP), or a wireless carrier. Even a company like T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), which built its rep on giving customers what they want, got greeted with skepticism earlier this year when it announced plans to drop all taxes and fees. In that case, the deal turned out to be exactly what was promised. That's not really true, however, when you look at Sprint's (NYSE:S) offer to cut your phone bill in half made to Verizon and AT&T customers. That promotion, while a good deal, only applied to the service portion of the bill, meaning people who accept the offer won't actually see their wireless bill cut in half. The same logic applies to many cable and ISP promotions where a short-term low price deal comes with a contract for future years that are more expensive. Pay television companies are notorious for offering prices that don't reflect the mandatory fees and surcharges customers have to pay. Because of that, news that Virgin Mobile (which is operated in the United States by Sprint) would be offering a year of unlimited talk, text, and data to customers who sign up by July 31 for $1 certainly caused consumers to raise an eyebrow. It seems like a phenomenal deal, but is it too good to be true? The Virgin Mobile deal requires buying an iPhone. Image source: Apple. The company is giving away a year of unlimited service (with high-speed data capped at 23GB a month) for $1, plus applicable taxes. That deal is not made up, it's not a bait-and-switch offer, but it's also not the whole story. To get a year of unlimited talk, text, and data for $1, the customer must purchase an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone and transfer his or her number to Virgin's Inner Circle plan, which costs $50 a month once the promotion ends. Virgin sells all currently offered iPhone models, including offering the entry-level iPhone SE for $279.99 for the 32GB version, which Apple sells for $399. The only thing approaching a catch here is one that's easy to avoid. To get the deal you need to buy an iPhone. If you buy one from Virgin, it will be locked, which locks you into its service after the promotion expires. To get around that, all you have to do is buy the phone directly from Apple. In that case, it will be unlocked, and you will be free to move to another provider at the end of the $1 promotion (or at any time, because Virgin does not lock people in with contracts). Aside from that, the only catch is that you have to pay taxes, which vary by market, but Virgin has not hidden that fact. This is actually a good deal that sets a new bar in the wireless industry. It's a bold move by Sprint, which is banking on the idea that after a year customers won't leave. That may not be true, but that's something shareholders, not consumers, should worry about.

Some of these stocks are unprofitable today, relying on strong sales growth and optimistic projections for the far future to reach these skyrocketing year-to-date gains. Others are already delivering solid bottom-line results to give their market caps a firmer footing. And these 10 tickers took very different paths to achieve today's terrific returns. Here's a closer look at the five biggest gainers: Image source: Getty Images. Universal Display's OLED display technology is becoming a staple among smartphone makers and television set builders. On-demand healthcare services specialist Teladoc is finding traction for its remote checkup tools. Wireless broadband chip designer Sequans is already eyeing the upcoming 5G wave of system upgrades, and the Internet of Things looms as a large growth opportunity. And Shopify is powering many of your favorite e-commerce sites today, with many more to come. All of these business successes are showing up in each company's earnings reports. Those that are not profitable today have demonstrated a clear strategy to rise above the break-even point someday soon, and investors are taking notice. These tickers deserve a closer look from investors with a knack for high-growth investments. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    Top-Performing Tech Stocks of 2017 -- The Motley Fool

85,Selena Maranjian,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here's the bad news: The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,365 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,687 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. Clearly, Social Security isn't going to give any of us a luxurious retirement. There's good news, though: There are many ways you can generate retirement income. It's smart to spend a little time figuring out how much money you'll need in retirement, and then planning how you can produce your needed cash flow. Here are a dozen strategies to consider. Image source: Getty Images. This one won't win a popularity contest, but it can be very effective. If you can work two or three more years than you originally planned to, your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). Here's what a difference this can make in your investing: Imagine that you sock away $10,000 per year for 20 years and it grows by an annual average of 8%, growing to about $494,000. If you can keep going for another three years, still averaging 8%, you'll end up with more than $657,000! That's more than $160,000 extra just for delaying retiring for a few years. Next, consider easing into full retirement instead of jumping in feet first. If you're willing and able to work a little in your first few years of retirement, you can generate some helpful income. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. Better still, a part-time job can also give your days more structure and regular opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Here are some ideas of ways you might work in retirement: You could be a cashier at a local retailer or deliver newspapers. You might do some freelance writing or editing or graphic design work. You might tutor kids in subjects you know well, or perhaps give adults or kids music or language lessons. You might do some consulting -- perhaps even for your former employer. You could babysit, walk dogs, or take on some handy-person jobs. These days the Internet offers even more options. You might make jewelry, soaps, or sweaters, and sell them online. You might even just work part-time for your current employer. Image source: Getty Images. Think twice before entering retirement with a lot of credit card debt or other high-interest debt. When you're living on a reduced income, it will be extra hard to pay that off, and those payments can hurt your ability to make other necessary payments. It's a good idea to enter retirement mortgage-free, too, if you can, so that you don't have to make any mortgage payments and will only have to deal with insurance, taxes, and maintenance. This great retirement income strategy is only great at certain times -- when interest rates are meaningful. Right now if you park $100,000 in certificates of deposit paying 1.5% in interest, you'll collect $1,500 per year, hardly a helpful sum. Back in 1984, though, rates for five-year, one-year, and six-month CDs were in the double digits. If you could get 10% on a $100,000 investment, you'd enjoy $10,000 per year, equivalent to about $830 per month. Low interest rates not only deliver little income, but they also don't keep up with inflation. Bonds are another interest-paying option, but the safest ones (from the U.S. government) tend to pay modest interest rates, especially in low-interest-rate environments. Still, if you have a lot of money, you might make this strategy work by buying a variety of bonds that will mature at different times, generating income over many years. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA -- and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The following table shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: $5,500 Invested Annually For: Growing at 6% Growing at 8% Growing at 10% 15 years $135,699 $161,284 $199,224 20 years $214460 $271,826 $346,514 25 years $319,860 $434,249 $595,000 30 years $460,909 $672,902 $995,189 Data source: Calculations by author. A 401(k) has much more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 for most people and $24,000 for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which are increasingly available, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! While some annuities, such as variable annuities and indexed annuities, can be quite problematic, often charging steep fees and sporting restrictive terms, fixed annuities are well worth considering. They're much simpler instruments, and they can start paying you immediately or on a deferred basis. Following are examples of the kind of income that various people might be able to secure in the form of an immediate fixed annuity in the current economic environment. (You'll generally be offered higher payments in times of higher prevailing interest rates.) Person/People Cost Monthly Income Annual Income Equivalent 65-year-old man $100,000 $545 $6,540 70-year-old man $100,000 $623 $7,476 70-year-old woman $100,000 $586 $7,032 65-year-old couple $200,000 $937 $11,244 70-year-old couple $200,000 $1,029 $12,348 75-year-old couple $200,000 $1,178 $14,136 Data source: immediateannuities.com. Annuities can provide much peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. A deferred annuity can also be smart, starting to pay you at a future point, such as when you turn a certain age. A 60-year-old man, for example, might spend $100,000 for an annuity that will start paying him $962 per month for the rest of his life beginning at age 70. That can remove any worries about running out of money late in life. You can generate income in retirement by selling off shares of stock from your stock portfolio over time -- but with dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! A $300,000 portfolio, for example, that sports an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll probably receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield Ford Motor Company 5.4% Verizon Communications 5% Chevron 4.1% Pfizer 3.8% Cisco Systems 3.6% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a fine option, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.6%. Image source: Getty Images. Next, you might consider a reverse mortgage. It's essentially a loan secured by your home. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- perhaps because you moved into a nursing home or died. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell your home unless they can afford to pay off the loan, but if you're really pinched for funds and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. Another home-related retirement-income option is relocating. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Borrowing against your life insurance is another option. If you have a life insurance policy that no one is depending on -- such as if the children you meant to protect with it are now grown and independent -- you might consider borrowing against it. This can work if you've bought ""permanent"" insurance such as whole life or universal life, and not term life insurance, that generally only lasts as long as you're paying for it. You'll be reducing or wiping out the value of the policy with your withdrawal(s), but if no one really needs the ultimate payout, it can make sense. Plus, the income is typically tax-free. Image source: Getty Images. A little creative thinking can pay off well when it comes to retirement income, too. You may be able to come up with some ways to spend less and/or bring in more money. For example, you could spend less by quitting cable TV and just streaming your video entertainment -- that might save $50 you per month or $600 per year. If you're not using the gym much but are paying $40 monthly for it, that's another $500 or so in potential annual savings. Believe it or not, you might save hundreds of dollars just by spending an hour on the phone calling insurance companies to get the best current deal on your home insurance and car insurance. Eating out less and having friends over to play games or watch movies can save on dining and entertainment expenses. If you smoke, you can probably save thousands of dollars per year by quitting -- and you might lengthen your life, too! To bring more moola in, you might rent out a room now and then via Airbnb, or even take in a boarder for a year or two. If you're not already using cash-back or rewards credit cards, look into them. If you charge about $1,200 per month on credit cards and earn 2% back, on average, you're looking at close to $300 in cash back per year. Clear out your basement, attic, and/or garage by selling things online or via a yard sale and you might net hundreds of dollars. Or take an easier route and donate clothes and household items to charity, reaping tax deductions. You could make things to sell online, too, such as soaps, furniture, or jewelry. Reducing your household's automotive fleet by one vehicle can save a lot in insurance and upkeep, too. Finally, learn more about Social Security strategies. Just as there are many ways to boost your retirement income, there are a bunch of ways to boost your Social Security income, as well. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or early, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks. ","
      
    12 Ways You Can Get More Money in Retirement  -- The Motley Fool

86,Billy Duberstein,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","
      
    CenturyLink's New Succession Plan Is Very Good News for Shareholders -- The Motley Fool

87,24/7 Wall St.,6292017,MarketWatch,6222017,"Published: June 27, 2017 7:15 a.m. ET By Investors love dividends. Whether the market is up or down, many investors need those dividends to help pay income in retirement. Dividends also account for up to half of all shareholder returns through time. While high dividends are desirable for investors, savvy investors know that not all dividends are created equal. 24/7 Wall St. has conducted a review of the top dividends from America’s largest companies. Almost all the companies should be recognizable to most Americans. It turns out that there were 25 large companies paying a yield of 3.5% or more — and some much higher. The reason that the 3.5% dividend yield matters so much to equity investors is that this is 1% higher than the average yields of the S&amp;P and Dow. This was also more than 100 basis points higher than the average yield of the 10-year to 30-year Treasury. The volatile dividends for real estate investment trusts (REITs) were excluded, while the safer dividends from utilities and other sectors were included. Much of the retail segment’s high dividend yields may have a similar set of caveats, and they may feel driven by lower and lower share prices. As of the last week of June 2017, the average S&amp;P 500 Index yield was 2.37% and the average yield of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks was 2.43%. The huge difference between the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 is that all Dow stocks currently pay dividends — while there were close to 80 non–dividend payers in the S&amp;P 500, and the index includes the higher-yielding REITs. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at just 2.13% and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was just 2.70%. The difference between the Treasury yields and equity yields is that the former are locked. Many of these major dividend paying companies should grow their revenue and earnings in the years ahead, and investors assume dividend and earnings growth in future years also will translate to higher share prices. 24/7 Wall St. used data from Thomson Reuters on financials and on target prices, and some extra color and commentary on what has driven these high yields also has been provided. The consensus analyst share price targets from Thomson Reuters have been used to show whether Wall Street thinks each company’s stock has room to appreciate or if they think there is already a fair value. Here are 25 great American companies paying dividends that 3.5% yield or greater. Macy's &gt; Yield: 6.78% &gt; Price: $22.46 &gt; Mean price target: $25.79 &gt; 52-week range: $21.51 to $45.41 &gt; Market cap: $6.8 billion Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M) has the highest dividend yield of major retailers at this time. Its stock also has been brutalized by the growth of Amazon, and Macy’s has been unable to turn its own omni-channel up enough to offset in-store sale erosion. Its yield was already high a year ago, but the big dividend yield growth for new investors has been due to the pain of a falling stock price for existing shareholders. Macy’s is also pursuing more store closures to focus on the most profitable locations. At the start of 2017, Macy’s had almost 150,000 employees and operated about 830 stores under the Macys, Bloomingdales, Bloomingdales The Outlet, Macys Backstage and Bluemercury banners. Kohl's &gt; Yield: 5.94% &gt; Price: $37.38 &gt; Mean price target: $40.52 &gt; 52-week range: $35.16 to $59.67 &gt; Market cap: $6.4 billion Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS) has faced many of the same issues as Macy’s, including the rise of Amazon and e-commerce. As of January 28, 2017, Kohl’s operated 1,154 department stores, 12 FILA outlets and another three Off-Aisle clearance centers. Seagate Technology &gt; Yield: 5.91% &gt; Price: $42.39 &gt; Mean price target: $46.23 &gt; 52-week range: $20.77 to $50.96 &gt; Market cap: $12.6 billion Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ: STX) is best known for its storage devices, and it is currently one of the dividend kings of the technology sector. It operates globally and dominates in storage devices, with a focus on hard drives, solid state drives and portable drives. Ford &gt; Yield: 5.43% &gt; Price: $11.10 &gt; Mean price target: $12.80 &gt; 52-week range: $10.67 to $14.04 &gt; Market cap: $44.2 billion Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) has a better dividend than a stock performance of late. It has struggled to find direction in the post-Mulally years and is soon to have a new chief executive. At the same time, Ford has been experiencing a peak-auto trend in the United States as it seems hard to imagine the 2016 sales cycle being as robust in the year and years ahead. Staples &gt; Yield: 5.17% &gt; Price: $9.19 &gt; Mean price target: $9.80 &gt; 52-week range: $7.24 to $10.25 &gt; Market cap: $6.0 billion Staples Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLS) is the king of all independent retailers of office supplies. That being said, it is under a relatively new leadership now that its acquisition of rival Office Depot failed to get approved. Staples has been a rumored buyout candidate of its own, but it also faces the Amazon and small e-commerce impact that has been a challenge to much of the retail landscape. AT&amp;T &gt; Yield: 5.16% &gt; Price: $38.13 &gt; Mean price target: $39.68 &gt; 52-week range: $36.10 to $43.89 &gt; Market cap: $234.4 billion AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T) is still the king of major telecom dividends, but its lead over Verizon has come in. AT&amp;T has already diversified with its acquisition of DirecTV, and it is further trying to diversify with the pending acquisition of Time Warner to further spread into cable, telecom and content. AT&amp;T’s revenue was almost $164 billion in 2016. Verizon &gt; Yield: 5.09% &gt; Price: $45.81 &gt; Mean price target: $50.05 &gt; 52-week range: $44.46 to $56.95 &gt; Market cap: $186.9 billion Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has the highest yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has so far been less of an acquirer than rival AT&amp;T, but it has now acquired AOL and Yahoo and plans to grow its video and ad platforms. Its revenue was $126 billion in 2016. Occidental Petroleum &gt; Yield: 5.06% &gt; Price: $60.24 &gt; Mean price target: $71.44 &gt; 52-week range: $57.20 to $78.48 &gt; Market cap: $46.1 billion Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) is not the largest of the oil companies in raw market value, but it is the largest oil and gas dividend of the integrated players. Some of that dividend boost is because its shares are way down from the highs, and a weak oil market might be a continued risk to Occidental and all oil and gas players. Occidental’s 2016 revenue of $10 billion was almost half of the revenues just two years earlier. FirstEnergy &gt; Yield: 4.98% &gt; Price: $30.04 &gt; Mean price target: $33.53 &gt; 52-week range: $27.93 to $36.60 &gt; Market cap: $13.3 billion FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) is an electricity utility and generator via coal-fired, nuclear, hydroelectric, oil and natural gas, wind and solar power generating facilities. The company serves approximately 6 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Target &gt; Yield: 4.89% &gt; Price: $51.45 &gt; Mean price target: $58.12 &gt; 52-week range: $48.56 to $79.33 &gt; Market cap: $28.4 billion Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) is in the middle of a tight retail market, wedged somewhere between the cross-hairs of Walmart and Amazon. The drop in Target’s shares has been far worse than rival Walmart, and that has helped to drive up the dividend. Despite having revenue of $69.5 billion in 2016, that is down from almost $74 billion the prior year. Southern Company &gt; Yield: 4.65% &gt; Price: $50.17 &gt; Mean price target: $51.16 &gt; 52-week range: $46.20 to $54.64 &gt; Market cap: $49.9 billion Southern Co. (NYSE: SO) is another electric utility and has power generation assets, sells wholesale electricity and distributes natural gas. Southern is based in Atlanta and claims roughly 9 million customers spread over electric and natural gas. Its 11 regulated utility markets are in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and several more states. General Motors &gt; Yield: 4.44% &gt; Price: $34.29 &gt; Mean price target: $39.50 &gt; 52-week range: $27.34 to $38.55 &gt; Market cap: $51.8 billion General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) might be its own company again since its notorious bankruptcy and re-emergence as a public company. The stock also has been pretty much a nothing-burger since that IPO, and just like rival Ford, GM faces tough comparisons for a peak U.S. auto trend. Still, GM has been unwinding some money-losing and less profitable efforts in Europe. Entergy &gt; Yield: 4.41% &gt; Price: $79.60 &gt; Mean price target: $78.69 &gt; 52-week range: $66.71 to $82.09 &gt; Market cap: $14.3 billion Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) is an electric utility based in New Orleans. It serves portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans. It distributes natural gas and delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers. Overall Entergy is one of the big players among utilities in the deep south. Although it operates through several different subsidiaries, it has over 14,000 employees. The stock has made steady gains over the past few years, and it is actually closing in on an all-time high — with a dividend like this, that says something. Valero Energy &gt; Yield: 4.24% &gt; Price: $66.28 &gt; Mean price target: $73.89 &gt; 52-week range: $46.88 to $71.40 &gt; Market cap: $29.6 billion Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) is a top petroleum refiner and ethanol producer in the country, and its stock can be volatile around the swings in oil pricing and also around how the refining sector’s margins grow and contract. Its revenue of more than $75 billion in 2016 is down handily from prior years, but much of that is price-driven by commodity prices rather than its raw profitability. Unlike traditional oil companies, refining companies do not thrive as well under high oil prices as the margins are tougher. As of December 31, 2016, the company owned 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day, and it owned and operated 11 ethanol plants with a combined capacity of approximately 1.4 billion gallons per year. Gap &gt; Yield: 4.19% &gt; Price: $22.27 &gt; Mean price target: $25.53 &gt; 52-week range: $19.33 to $30.74 &gt; Market cap: $8.8 billion Gap Inc. (GPS) has become a post-growth retailer after prior decades of expansion, and it is facing many of the same Amazon-related and e-commerce pressure of other retailers. The company has consolidated many stores under the namesake Gap brand, and it has Old Navy and Banana Republic brands. Gap also owns Athleta and Intermix.

88,,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"In support of the “Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality,” more than 80,000 websites - from big social media platforms like Facebook to streaming services like Netflix and matchmaking website OkCupid - are displaying banners, alerts, ads and short videos to urge the public to oppose the overturn of the landmark 2015 net neutrality rules. Net neutrality is a broad principle that prohibits broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. The rule was implemented by the Obama administration in 2015. Changes to the rule are being proposed by the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commision (FCC), Ajit Pai, appointed by President Donald Trump in January. Pai wants the commission to repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities, saying the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama harm jobs and investment. The FCC voted 2-1 in May to advance a Republican plan to reverse the “net neutrality” order. During a speech in April, Pai asked: “Do we want the government to control the internet? Or do we want to embrace the light-touch approach” in place since 1996 until it was revised in 2015. At a Capitol Hill press conference, Democrats and internet companies vowed to fight the changes and suggested internet companies could slow internet speeds. Senator Edward Markey said the internet “is under attack.” “We will not let this takeover happen,” Markey said. “A free and open internet is our right and we will fight to defend it.” FCC spokesman Brian Hart declined to comment. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat on a commission with two current vacancies, said in a statement on Wednesday she supports “those who believe that a free and open internet is a foundational principle of our democracy.” The public will have until mid-August to send comments to the FCC before the final vote. More than 550,000 comments have been filed in the last day with the FCC and more than 6.3 million filed to date and thousands of people called Capitol Hill offices to express concerns. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on the social media platform, “Right now, the FCC has rules in place to make sure the internet continues to be an open platform for everyone. At Facebook, we strongly support those rules.” Twitter expressed support for the existing rules, encouraging users to protest while promoting the hashtag #NetNeutrality. “Net Neutrality is foundational to competitive, free enterprise, entrepreneurial market entry – and reaching global customers. You don’t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea, a unique perspective to share, and a compelling vision can get in the game,” Twitter said in a blog. Online forum Reddit displayed a pop-up message that slowly loads the text, “The internet’s less fun when your favorite sites load slowly, isn’t it?” A pop-up banner on The American Civil Liberties Union’s website read: “Trump’s FCC wants to kill net neutrality. This would let the cable and phone companies slow down any site they don’t like or that won’t pay extra.” ","

89,,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday that it was launching new leasing options aimed at price-sensitive customers who want to upgrade their phones more often, the carrier’s latest effort to lure subscribers in an oversaturated market for wireless service. The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier will now allow customers to lease any phone and have the option to upgrade it after a year. Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments. “We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,” Robert Hackl, Sprint’s senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years. Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors’ plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices. Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s about lowering the cost for the consumer,” he said. “What’s in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.” The company, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network. “Considering that they’re more in an M&A mindset, they need a growing company,” Entner said, of Sprint executives. “Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.” ","

Apoyando al “Día de la Acción por el Internet para Salvar a la Neutralidad de la Red”, más de 80.000 páginas web - desde grandes plataformas de redes sociales como Facebook hasta servicios de streaming como Netflix y webs de citas como OkCupid - están desplegando pancartas, alertas, anuncios y clips de vídeo para alentar al público a que se oponga a la derogación de las emblemáticas leyes de 2015 por la neutralidad de la red. La neutralidad de la red es un principio que prohíbe que los proveedores de banda ancha otorguen o vendan acceso a Internet rápido, esencialmente lo que vendría a ser una “vía rápida”, a algunos servicios de internen y a otros no. La ley fue implementada en 2015 por la administración del anterior presidente, el demócrata Barack Obama. Cambios a esta legislación están siendo propuestos por el director de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de EEUU (FCC, por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, nombrado en enero por el actual presidente, el republicano Donald Trump. Pai quiere que la comisión revoque las leyes que reclasificaron a los proveedores de Internet como si fuesen servicios públicos, alegando que las leyes del Internet abierto adoptadas por Obama dañan el empleo y la inversión. La FCC votó 2 a 1 en mayo dar inicio a un plan republicano que derogase la orden de “neutralidad de la red”. Durante un discurso en abril, Pai preguntó: “¿Queremos que el gobierno controle el Internet?¿O queremos acoger la estrategia de tacto fino (en vigor desde 1996 hasta que fue revisada en 2015)?”. En una rueda de prensa en Capitol Hill, demócratas y empresas de Internet se comprometieron a luchar contra los cambios y sugirieron que las empresas de Internet podrían ralentizar la velocidad de red. El senador Edward Markey dijo que el Internet “está siendo atacado”. “No vamos a dejar que este asalto ocurra”, dijo Markey. “Un Internet libre y abierto es nuestro derecho y lucharemos por defenderlo”. Grandes proveedores de banda ancha, incluyendo a AT&T Inc y Verizon Communications Inc, reconocieron el apoyo del público por la neutralidad de la red. Enfatizaron que estaban a favor de un “Internet abierto” pero dejaron claro que estaban contra la orden de reclasificación de la neutralidad de la red de 2015 que dijeron que, según ellos, podía llevar a la regulación gubernamental de los precios. El portavoz de la FCC Brian Hart rechazó comentar la cuestión. La comisionada de la FCC, Mignon Clyburn, la única demócrata en una comisión que cuenta con dos plazas vacantes, dijo en un comunicado el miércoles que apoya “a aquellos que creen que un Internet libre y abierto es un principio fundacional de nuestra democracia”.

(DIS) to rest during the Allen & Co. annual media and technology conference being held this week in Sun Valley, Idaho. When asked if there was truth to the rumors, which resurfaced last week, he bluntly responded ""No,"" according to Variety. The executive, who has expressed interest in deal-making in the past, made the comment as he walked past a group of reporters at the confab. The annual event, which brings together some of the leading executives in entertainment and technology, has spawned many deals in the past. (See also: Three Reasons Why Verizon Won't Buy Disney) Previewing the conference, the New York Post last week reported McAdam could be gearing up for his next acquisition after completing its purchase of the core internet assets of Yahoo, and that he may set his sights on Disney. The paper cited a “well-placed banker” as saying Verizon can’t be counted out as a suitor for the Burbank, Calif.-based media giant. That report prompted Wall Street analysts to come out against a deal, arguing it would be too costly for Verizon and didn’t make a whole lot of sense. “[W]hen we saw this latest ‘news’ of Verizon looking to buy Disney, we laughed. Out loud. In fact, we’re still laughing. What would a wireless juggernaut want with a theme park, a YUGE consumer products line and the various movie studios,” wrote Wells Fargo media analyst Marci Ryvicker in a research report at the time. Acquiring Disney would take a lot more than the $4.5 billion Verizon spent for Yahoo assets given the entertainment company has a market value of $168 billion. Verizon would have to offer up a big premium to see a deal come to fruition with some estimates hitting $190 billion. Even if McAdam was looking to strike up some type of alliance with Disney, he would be hard pressed to do so, at least at the Allen & Co. confab. Chief Executive  Bob Iger isn’t attending this year’s event in Sun Valley.  (See also: Yahoo and AOL Will Form 'Oath') While the CEO was quick to dismiss a deal with Disney, that doesn’t mean the company isn’t looking for mergers and acquisitions after closing on its purchase of Yahoo’s core internet assets. Back in April, McAdam told Bloomberg the company is open to the possibility of merging with either Comcast (CMCSA), Disney, or CBS (CBS)  if it helps the mobile network carrier to get a better grip on the rapidly evolving telecom industry and beat its big spending rival AT&T (T).

He and his clients own shares of VZ.) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) may be weighing a purchase of Walt Disney Co. (DIS) to bolster its content ownership, several news stories recently speculated. But perhaps Verizon should consider looking in another direction and grab both CBS Corp. (CBS) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB) at a fraction of what Disney would cost, without taking on the theme parks and the troubles of ESPN. Disney has an enterprise value of about $180 billion, which means a deal to acquire Disney would likely cost $200 billion or more to get investors on board to approve a deal. CBS and Viacom together would have an enterprise value of nearly $60 billion, putting a purchase of both these companies at nearly one-third the price of Disney. (See also: Three Reasons Why Verizon Won't Buy Disney.) It was just last fall when talks were swirling about bringing Viacom and CBS back together, and now Verizon could be in a position to make that happen. There is something else Viacom and CBS have in common: National Amusements Inc., which owns nearly 80 percent of both Viacom and CBS. National Amusements Inc. is controlled by media mogul Sumner Redstone, which could make brokering such a deal easier – at least because of the limited number of interested parties. In December 2016, Sumner and his daughter, Shari Redstone, killed the possibility of a merger between CBS and Viacom. Verizon's stock has performed poorly in 2017, down almost 20 percent. Over the past three years, the stock is down nearly 12.5 percent. Earnings growth is expected to be anemic as well, putting further pressure on Verizon to make a move to keep pace with competitors AT&T Inc. (T) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), which acquired Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and NBC Universal, respectively, to grab content. VZ data by YCharts Comcast, the cable and communications giant, is expected to grow its EPS by nearly 53 percent over the next three years, while analysts are looking for Verizon to grow its EPS by only 1 percent. VZ Annual EPS Estimates data by YCharts Meanwhile, CBS is expected to grow EPS by nearly 45 percent, and Viacom is expected to increase by almost 20 percent. VIAB Annual EPS Estimates data by YCharts Together, both CBS and Viacom could bring a combined $27 billion in projected revenue to Verizon, and perhaps spur some growth and provide synergies to Verizon. After all, a deal would bring Verizon Showtime, the movie studio Paramount Pictures, TV stations, a line-up of shows, CBS Sports and the NFL. The NFL on CBS would perhaps be tied into Verizon mobile's NFL offering. VIAB Annual Revenue Estimates data by YCharts According to Comcast's most recent 10-K filing, the NBC Universal segment grew revenue by 11 percent, to $31.6 billion, while the cable communications segment grew revenue by 6.6 percent, to $50 billion. Since March 2013, when Comcast completed its acquisition of NBC, shares have risen by nearly 93 percent. Verizon has taken on a considerable amount of debt in recent years, most notably in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion. Verizon's current long-term debt stands at nearly $120 billion. Verizon needs a shot in the arm, and perhaps bringing CBS and Viacom together under the Verizon umbrella could be key to that.

95,Leo Sun,7132017,Fool,7062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) investors probably know that the telecom giant evolved from the AT&T's (NYSE:T) forced divestment of the Bell Operating Companies in the 1980s. Bell Atlantic, one of the seven ""Baby Bells"", merged with a few other Bells to become ""Verizon"" -- a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon -- in 2000. Verizon subsequently became the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. Over the past two years, it dramatically reduced its wireline presence, shuttered its public cloud business, and aggressively expanded into the online media space by gobbling up AOL and Yahoo's internet businesses. Source: Getty. Today, let's examine five lesser-known facts about Verizon which might change your overall perception of the evolving telecom company. Newer investors might think that Verizon always owned Verizon Wireless. However, that business was actually founded as a joint venture between Verizon and British telco Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) in 1999. In 2014, Verizon paid a whopping $130 billion to acquire Vodafone's 45% stake. However, that buyout increased Verizon's debt, reduced its free cash flow, and doubled its exposure to the saturated wireless market. Last quarter, Verizon posted its first-ever decline in wireless subscribers -- making the intelligence of that deal seem questionable. To offset that softness, Verizon is investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) market. Verizon's IoT business generated nearly $1 billion in revenue last year, a drop in the pond relative to its total revenue of $126 billion, but still an indication that it's reaching drones, connected cars, wearables, and other IoT gadgets. In the drone market, Verizon developed new long-range autonomous drone applications with Sierra Wireless and American Aerospace Technologies, a drone monitoring partnership with NASA, and launched its new ThingSpace IoT platform for connected devices. It also acquired Skyward, a drone management start-up, earlier this year. That start-up makes a suite of tools for tracking drones, handling pilot records, and organizing administrative paperwork. That's also why Verizon acquired Telogis -- a developer of cloud-based telematics, compliance, and navigation systems used by major automakers and telcos -- last year. That purchase helps Verizon connect to vehicle fleets and gather data from their routes. It also enhances its own Verizon Telematics business, which is used in over 40 countries. Verizon also previously launched Hum, a two-piece hardware system which connects any old car manufactured since 1996 to Verizon's network. Hum also adds diagnostics and telematics functions to the tethered mobile app, which essentially turns any car into a ""connected"" one. Those moves lay down the foundations for fully autonomous drones and cars to travel across Verizon's wireless networks in the near future -- which could cause widespread paradigm shifts across multiple industries. AT&T and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) have repeatedly opposed ""One Touch Make Ready"" rules, which allow ISPs to attach their own wires on utility poles themselves without waiting for other providers to move their own. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, which is expanding its Fiber network nationwide, claims that AT&T and Comcast aren't violating the rules by refusing to move their wires to make room for Google Fiber's. Verizon also supports the enforcement of those rules, because it plans to roll out a lot of new fiber to support its wireless network in the near future. In a blog post and FCC filing, Verizon complains that it takes ""six months to a year"" and ""piles of paperwork"" to get a new attachment approved and placed on a pole. If the FCC sides with Verizon over AT&T and Comcast, Google Fiber might experience an unexpected growth spurt. In a previous article, I discussed how Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX) liberal statements often antagonized conservative customers -- yet had no long-term impact on its revenue growth. On the other side of that coin is Verizon, with its staunchly conservative views often casting a shadow over its core businesses. Back in 2007, Verizon blocked text messages from a pro-choice group. In 2009, it sponsored a controversial climate change denier rally organized by a pro-coal group in West Virginia. Three years ago, it killed off its own fledgling tech news site, Sugarstring, reportedly because it published too many stories on net neutrality and surveillance -- both hot button topics for its parent company. Verizon's near-term future still relies heavily on the expansion of its wireless customer base and its ability to digest AOL and Yahoo's online business. However, the financial impact of the Vodafone deal can still be felt today, its expansion into new IoT markets can reduce its dependence on smartphones, and the enforcement of ""One Touch Make Ready"" rules could help it expand its wireless infrastructure to meet next-gen 5G needs.

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) just quietly increased the price of its One Plus plan by another $5 per month. T-Mobile first introduced One Plus, an add-on to its One unlimited data plan, after Verizon (NYSE:VZ) launched its unlimited plan, which includes HD video streaming and up to 10 GB of high-speed tethering. One Plus matches those capabilities and throws in unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi from Gogo. With the price increase, T-Mobile charges $80 per month for a single line -- the same as Verizon's unlimited plan. In fact, T-Mobile's pricing is a bit higher than Verizon's for family plans of three or more lines (even when you account for the inclusion of taxes and fees in T-Mobile's price). While the price increase isn't great for consumers, it's a sign that T-Mobile is starting take its foot off the pedal with its competitive pressure. Sprint (NYSE:S) has been most aggressive with its pricing, but it doesn't have the network quality to compete with T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T (NYSE:T) Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile has been the only major wireless carrier to be able to raise its average service revenue per subscriber in the last few years. Granted, it still sits below Verizon and AT&T, but it's also adding new subscribers, which supports strong revenue growth. T-Mobile has given itself several hurdles to climb over in order to increase its revenue per subscriber. First, it gave customers the option to lock in their pricing indefinitely as long as they stick to their current plan. That means T-Mobile has to convince subscribers to switch to its unlimited plan in order to increase revenue from existing customers. Second, it switched to only offering unlimited data plans. The One Plus plan is its only means of increasing the bill on those unlimited customers. T-Mobile's decision to increase the price on One Plus indicates it's confident the price increase won't negatively impact net additions too much. If it proves successful, it could lead to a price increase of its original unlimited plan, which would have a much bigger impact on ARPU. Investors should look for commentary on management's pricing decision during the company's upcoming earnings call. If T-Mobile begins to bump its pricing higher across the board, it's particularly good for both AT&T and Verizon investors, and should have a modestly positive impact on Sprint. For Sprint, its biggest competitive advantage is its pricing. Its service is priced well below the competitors, and T-Mobile increasing its prices just makes that advantage greater. That said, Sprint will only attract price-conscious consumers, so it may have difficulty increasing its prices in the future and keeping subscriber churn under control. Both AT&T and Verizon, meanwhile, have suffered significant declines in service revenue as a result of T-Mobile's aggressive promotions. Price increases may be a sign that it's ready to take its foot off the pedal and start focusing more on cash flow instead of customer acquisition. That means AT&T and Verizon may experience fewer switchers and customer retention expenses, and gain a bit more freedom to play around with pricing on their own. AT&T has been aggressive with its promotions, offering free HBO and a discount on its video services for subscribers to its $90-per-month Unlimited Plus plan. Verizon may offer similar incentives with the expected launch of a nationwide television streaming service later this year, but it might not have to if T-Mobile eases up on the pressure. As the carrier stealing customers away and providing innovative offers, any reduction in competitive pressure from T-Mobile should be welcome news for investors in the other three major wireless companies. The price increase for T-Mobile's One Plus plan may be just the start, and that's good for everyone. Well, everyone except for the consumers that missed out on saving $5 per month per line.

    T-Mobile's Unlimited Plan Practically Costs the Same as Verizon's Now -- The Motley Fool

At the beginning of the year, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) said it planned to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores, expanding its retail footprint to catch up with its network expansion. After the first quarter, T-Mobile had to update its outlook to 1,500 T-Mobile stores. T-Mobile's VP of Sales Jon Freier tweeted this week the company has opened 1,000 stores already this year, surpassing its original goal. The footprint expansion represents a huge opportunity for T-Mobile. While the company has been able to continue stealing away customers from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), expanding its footprint outside of major metro areas presents additional upside for the wireless carrier. Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile expects its new stores to cover 30 million to 40 million new people. What's more, the competition in the areas where T-Mobile is opening new stores is much less intense than the metro areas it currently operates, giving T-Mobile a good opportunity to take market share. T-Mobile already has strong brand recognition in these markets thanks to its national advertising campaigns, so it should be able to quickly capture market share. CFO Braxton Carter said a market share in the teens is achievable within a five-year time frame. That could mean an additional 5 million customers or so over the next five years just from the stores it's opening this year. That growth will be in addition to the customers T-Mobile is still bringing in from the two-thirds of the country it covered with its retail stores in 2016. That growth is still going strong, with T-Mobile adding 1.3 million customers in the first quarter between T-Mobile and MetroPCS. That's four straight years of adding over 1 million customers every quarter. Expanding its retail footprint also gives T-Mobile room to increase its pricing as it's now competing for a larger market. The company recently increased the price of its ONE Plus plan, putting it roughly in line with Verizon's unlimited plan. That could be just the start of price increases at T-Mobile as it starts to focus on cash flow. But T-Mobile just set a record low postpaid churn rate in its first quarter. Combined with the new greenfield markets its retail operations are expanding into, it can afford to see its net additions in existing markets wane a bit. Importantly, existing customers can keep their current pricing for as long as they keep their current plans. That should help keep churn rate low. So, not only do T-Mobile's new store openings support customer growth, they support average revenue per user growth for the carrier. With the broadest retail footprints in the country, AT&T and Verizon are going to be the biggest losers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Both companies have been bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile for years now. AT&T is relying on bundle economics to keep customers from leaving. It's offering all unlimited plan customers $25 off a DIRECTV package, and Unlimited Plus customers also get free HBO on any AT&T video service. Verizon is relying on the strength of its brand and its network, which still regularly ranks atop the four national carriers in independent studies. Verizon may also launch a nationwide video streaming service later this year that it could bundle. But consumers are cutting the cord more than ever, so it's not clear how much a bundle will help. That said, Verizon is better positioned than AT&T to hold onto its customers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Nonetheless, both companies must remain aggressive, as the competition in the industry remains fierce. ","

Retirees have a different set of financial priorities than their younger counterparts. Instead of seeking high-growth investments, these investors should focus on owning lower-risk stocks that also provide a steady stream of income. Which stocks do we think are a good choice for this age cohort? We asked that question to a team of Motley Fool investors, and they picked Ford (NYSE:F), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). Image source: Getty Images. John Rosevear (Ford): Everybody knows Ford, an iconic American brand that has undergone a renaissance over the last decade or so. But why is it a good stock for retirees now? Consider the following: To be clear, there are a couple of reasons why Ford's stock is cheap right now. First, Wall Street is concerned that the U.S. new-car market is slowing, which could squeeze Ford's profit margins for a time. Second, investors have had concerns about how well Ford is keeping up with rivals (notably General Motors) in terms of both future innovation and its products in the here and now. That's part of why Ford has a new CEO who has promised to aggressively address both. My sense is that Jim Hackett is the right leader to shift the Blue Oval back into high gear. If so, Ford's profits and stock price should both climb nicely. It may take a little while for that to happen, but Ford's fat dividend will help make it easy to stay patient. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Your golden years should be spent enjoying life, not worrying about the latest tech trends, or what part of the market is hot today. Steady companies with strong dividends are what I think investors in their golden years should value most. And Verizon is the perfect stock for those investors. Verizon is one of only four major U.S. cellular-network operators, and it's really only competing with AT&T for customers who demand a fast, reliable, and national network. That gives it pricing power and the cash flow needed to invest in next-generation networks, like the 5G networks that are rolling out today. You can see below the free cash the company was generating when it had a bigger 4G network than competitors, and now it's investing in 5G, which it hopes will lead to a competitive advantage in 2018 and beyond. VZ data by YCharts. Verizon's dividend today would be enough to make it a great investment, but I think the number of connected devices will only grow in the future. And having a leading 5G network will be a huge advantage for Verizon as that happens. This should be a company that pays a great dividend for many years to come, making it a great stock for your golden years. While investing in renewables should help shareholders feel good about this company's commitment to go green, these moves are paying off financially, too. Over the last decade, these investments have helped NextEra to grow its adjusted earnings per share more than 8.1% annually. In turn, the company has been able to raise its dividend each year by a similar rate. The markets have responded to these developments by taking shareholders on a highly profitable ride. SPY Total Return Price data by YCharts. Moving forward, NextEra believes that it will be able to continue growing its profits and dividend by 6% to 8% annually over the next few years through continued investment in new growth projects. When you combine that with the company's well-covered dividend yield of 2.8% -- NextEra's dividend payout ratio is only 44% of earnings -- NextEra stands a good shot at providing investors with high single-digit total returns. That makes this an ideal stock for income investors to put on their radars. ","

Cord cutting started picking up steam in 2016 when 1.9 million pay-TV customers abandoned the service, according to an estimate from SNL Kagan. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The research group expects 10.8 million more customers to cut the cord over the next five years, with total subscribers falling to 82.3 million. That's bad news for pay-TV giants like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T). But it could be a major opportunity for virtual providers like DISH Network's (NASDAQ:DISH) Sling TV to take share of the pay-TV market. Kagan estimates virtual service subscribers will climb to 11 million by 2021. Image source: Getty Images. Even though some consumers ditch their traditional pay-TV plans, they still have a habit of sitting in front of the television. That leads them to spend more time watching over-the-top video services compared to cord-never households, according to data from Comscore. Virtual pay-TV providers often offer cord cutters a lower-priced option compared to traditional cable, which may attract some to simply switch service providers. Considering the switching costs for virtual providers is extremely low for customers (and often includes free trials), many cord-cutters may opt to sample various services to see if any fit their lifestyle at a price they can accept. There are currently just over 3 million virtual pay-TV subscribers in the U.S. Sling TV is the market leader with over 2 million subscribers. The number of virtual options continues to grow with Hulu and YouTube recently offering live TV services. AT&T launched DIRECTV Now last fall. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is expected to launch its own over-the-top service as well. The space is much more wide open for competitors compared to traditional television content delivery, which required significant upfront capital investments. As more and more companies enter the market, it could help accelerate the cord cutting trend at traditional providers. Some companies like DISH, AT&T, and Verizon will be cannibalizing their own services, although management likes to say it's expanding the addressable market. The problem cable stalwarts like Comcast now face is the potential erosion of their video subscriber base as more competition enters the market. Comcast currently benefits from offering a premium product compared to traditional and virtual distributors. Its X-1 platform for on-demand and streaming content has helped improve subscriber retention. Additionally, streaming services are much more prone to technical glitches and outages, making the viewing experience sub-par at times. But as more competitors enter the over-the-top market and technology improves, Comcast's advantages may disappear. If that's the case, it will see an uptick in subscribers abandoning its video service and find itself forced to do what AT&T and DISH Network did and launch its own OTT service. That could result in lower profit margins for its video business, as these services generally carry significantly lower service prices while programming expenses take up a larger share of revenue. While it beats the prospects of losing a customer entirely, Comcast will want to delay an over-the-top service as long as it can. There is a potential upside for traditional pay-TV providers, though. Many are tied to certain territories due to the limitations of the physical infrastructure required for distribution. Virtual providers can easily operate nationwide, opening up new markets to companies like Comcast and Verizon. (AT&T and DISH notably already have nationwide coverage through satellite.) Verizon's territory is relatively small compared to Comcast, so it makes sense that it's planning to launch in the near future while Comcast delays a virtual service outside of its territory. The next wave of cord cutting is just starting to build to a crest and the influx of virtual providers is helping it gather momentum. The good news is that many cord-cutters will be looking for a replacement instead of an alternative, which, as Kagan's estimates show, ought to result in most customers paying for TV one way or another.

The average dividend stock on the S&P 500 pays a little over 2%, which understandably doesn't get many income investors too excited. However, there are some stocks that pay much higher dividends that are safe and have lots of long-term growth potential. Here are three examples, all of which yield more than 5% as of this writing. Company Symbol Recent Share Price Dividend Yield Verizon VZ $44.66 5.2% Store Capital Corp. STOR $22.45 5.2% Senior Housing Properties Trust SNH $20.44 7.6% Data Source: TD Ameritrade and author's own calculations. Share prices and dividend yields as of 7/1/2017. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is an excellent choice for investors who need a steady, reliable income stream, and is actually the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The 5.2% dividend yield paid by the telecom giant is backed by reliable cash flow generated by the company's subscribers. Image source: Getty Images. The company's size and financial flexibility should give it a durable competitive advantage in developing new technologies (such as its anticipated 5G network) and pursuing attractive value-adding acquisition opportunities that come up, which it has certainly shown its willingness to do in recent years. Verizon's dividend is not only generous, but it is also safe. The payout represents just 62% of 2017's expected earnings, so the company has plenty of cushion to absorb any earnings weakness, and also has plenty of cash to use for future dividend increases. Finally, with a P/E ratio of just 12 times 2017's expected earnings, Verizon looks like quite a bargain at the current share price. Net-lease REIT Store Capital (NYSE:STOR) recently announced that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, had acquired a 9.8% stake in the company. In a nutshell, ""net-lease"" real estate means that tenants sign leases that require them to pay property taxes, building insurance, and certain maintenance expenses. These leases typically have long initial terms and have annual rent increases, or escalators, built in. The benefits are a steady, predictable income stream, as well as minimal vacancy risk. In fact, 99.5% of Store Capital's properties are occupied as of the first quarter of 2017. Store Capital owns 1,750 properties, the majority of which are leased to retail businesses, with a particular emphasis on service-based businesses like movie theaters and restaurants. And the business has grown rapidly, at an average rate of 76 new properties per quarter. Thanks to the perceived weakness in the retail industry, which doesn't affect most of Store's tenants, the stock is down about 20% over the past year, even after the ""Buffett rally,"" which has created an interesting opportunity for long-term investors. Healthcare real estate could grow rapidly over the coming decades, especially senior-specific property types, as the Baby Boomer generation retires and the 65-and-older population in the U.S. roughly doubles by 2050, and older age groups are expected to grow even faster. Senior Housing Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SNH) could be a smart way to invest in this growth, and generate a fantastic income stream along the way. Image source: Senior Housing Properties Trust investor presentation. Despite the name, just over half of Senior Housing Properties Trust's portfolio of 434 properties is made up of senior housing, with medical offices making up most of the rest. The company's tenants derive 97% of their revenue from stable private-pay revenue sources, one of the highest ratios in the healthcare REIT industry. Many readers may think that Senior Housing Properties Trust's 7.6% dividend yield may sound too good to be true. However, it represents just 83% of the company's FFO, which isn't high for a REIT, so there is no reason to worry about the safety of the income stream. And as I recently wrote, the company represents a pretty compelling bargain at the current price. ","

However, would an Amazon-Dish partnership really have any impact on an investment thesis for Amazon stock? After running through some of the benefits from a potential partnership I think Amazon investors should consider the potential Dish partnership an interesting proposition, but not something that should change their current Amazon investment strategy. Here's why: Image source: Pexels. Aside from the idea of launching a phone service for Prime members, most of the ideas above are simply improvements to what the company is already doing (or, in the case of drones, testing). So the primary benefit for Amazon creating a partnership with Dish would be to give it more control over current operations, and not necessarily to create new revenue streams. More control over existing services is great, but it's not exactly something that investors should get all that excited about. What's still unclear is how much this could cost Amazon. There was no estimate on how much Amazon might pony up for such a deal, but investors should keep in mind that building out wireless networks -- as Dish is doing -- is very expensive. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is expected to spend about $17 billion in capital expenditures this year, and AT&T's could hit $22 billion. Not all of that will come from building out their networks, but much of it will. Verizon CFO Matt Ellis said on the company's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings call that ""you should expect to see that CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017."" As such, if Amazon agrees to help spend capital to build out a network in partnership with Dish, it could end up being a costly venture. Rather than making any investment moves on this rumor, investors should just take note that Amazon is simply looking into how it can expand its services through wireless networks. Eventually, that could bring the company more control over its products and services, and perhaps give it an improved path to introduce new ones down the road -- but changing your investment strategy because of this rumor at this point would be pure speculation.

Source: Getty Images. AT&T plans to buy Time Warner to expand its media ecosystem, which already includes U-verse, DirecTV, and ""sponsored data"" plans that provide AT&T customers with data-free streaming of its first-party and sponsored videos. If AT&T adds Time Warner's stable of media properties (HBO, CNN, Warner Bros.) to that mix, it could become a major threat to Netflix with its data-free bundles. Locking in customers offsets AT&T's sluggish growth in U.S. postpaid wireless customers, and diversifies its business with additional streams of revenue. It's similar to what Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is doing with its recent purchases of AOL and Yahoo's internet properties. But it's unclear how valuable the CNN brand is to AT&T's core strategy. On one hand, CNN's ratings rose significantly over the past few years under Zucker's watch. It just posted its most-watched second quarter in history with over a million daytime viewers in the 25-54 age group. Adding CNN to AT&T's sponsored or unlimited data plans could accelerate the network's digital transformation, while widening its moat against rivals like Verizon. CNN's mobile app. Source: Google Play. On the other hand, CNN still trails Fox News and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) MSNBC in total viewership. It also doesn't complement Time Warner's other entertainment-oriented properties, which are easier to integrate and less controversial. Buying CNN might also raise regulatory issues, with the nation's biggest pay-TV provider controlling the third largest cable news network. But this could just all be sound and fury signifying nothing. AT&T hasn't officially said anything about firing Zucker or selling CNN, and the Time Warner merger will likely be approved. The Republican-controlled FCC allowed AT&T to skip a lengthy public-interest review, provided that it sells its FCC licenses, while Trump's appointed DOJ antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, previously stated that he doesn't believe that the megamerger represents ""a major antitrust problem."" CNN's ongoing battles with the Trump Administration and its supporters dominate the headlines, but they're distracting investors from the real issues. The inclusion or exclusion of CNN from the deal won't matter as much as retaining HBO or the other Warner Bros. media properties, so it will likely boil down to what regulators want. ","

Income investors like dividend stocks because they not only make regular payments to shareholders but also have growth potential for the long haul. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) has done a good job over time of identifying dividend stocks that pay above-average yields and also have room to move higher, and the exchange traded fund's long-term returns have been solid.

VYM Total Return Price data by YCharts. Even though the overall market has gained ground this year, some sectors of the stock market haven't been as lucky, and those laggards show up clearly among Vanguard High Dividend Yield's top holdings. The energy sector has taken a hard hit in 2017, as oil prices have renewed their downward trend after recovering somewhat in 2016. Falling crude has put pressure on players from the largest integrated oil companies in the world to smaller exploration and production companies, and even Dow components ExxonMobil and Chevron saw declines of roughly 10% in the first half of the year because of those challenges. Industrial giant General Electric has posted similar declines so far in 2017, largely because of its ill-timed foray into the oil and gas sector a few years ago. The telecommunications sector has also performed poorly, falling prey to highly competitive conditions in the industry that have threatened even its most important companies. Verizon and AT&T have always been known for their attractive dividend yields, but the two wireless giants have had to fight against smaller carriers offering discounted prices for their services. So far, both companies haven't yet been able to convince customers completely that any superior quality is worth paying a premium subscription rate to get. With potentially costly upgrades to 5G networks looming, shareholders aren't certain whether profitability for the telecom giants will paint as attractive a picture as it has in the past. Finally, even in some strong sectors of the market, Vanguard High Dividend Yield has been saddled with underperformers. Technology stocks have advanced more sharply in 2017 than most other sectors, but major ETF holdings Intel and IBM have both lost ground this year. The two tech giants share the challenge of keeping up with the times, adapting their long and successful business models to address new competition while still innovating to attract high-end customers. Investors haven't been satisfied with their efforts to date, and each will have to work harder to sustain and build their businesses going forward. Image source: Getty Images. Boeing has also produced gains of more than 30% for the ETF. The commercial aerospace industry has remained strong for years, and airline consolidation has led many carriers to make new orders to update their aircraft fleets and maximize efficiency. Boeing also stands to gain from increased defense spending from the U.S. government, and greater military revenue could provide a new leg up on what has already been an impressive rally for the aerospace giant. Short-term performance in any investment can be volatile, and investors shouldn't worry about the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF's underperformance compared to the broader S&P 500 during the first half of 2017. Over time, ups and downs in the fund's returns tend to even out and provide solid long-term performance to shareholders who follow a disciplined income investing strategy. ","

Net neutrality, also called open internet, is the idea that everyone as a right to fair and unfettered online access. Under President Barack Obama, the Federal Communications Commission reclassified internet service providers with Title II of the Telecommunications Act, allowing them to regulate providers as common carriers, like telephone networks. Now, under a new administration and agency head, Ajit Pai, the FCC is planning to reverse Obama-era open internet policies. Read: FCC takes first step in rolling back net neutrality rules Also read: Here’s how other countries are addressing net neutrality The main fear among internet users is that devoid of net neutrality regulations internet service providers could throttle the speed at which users can access certain sites, creating “slow lanes.” Those opposed to net neutrality, however, argue that internet service providers were never meant to be regulated as common carriers and that it gives the government too much power in stifling what should be a free market.

Anyone with a great idea, a unique perspective to share, and a compelling vision can get in the game. “Without the guiding principles of net neutrality, it is entirely possible Twitter would not have come from a somewhat quirky experimental 140-character SMS service to where we are today.” #NetNeutrality allowed me to invent the web without having to ask for permission.

The Writers Guild of America sent a letter to Chairman Pai on behalf of Hollywood film and TV screenwriters. “The open internet has been critically important for content creators,” the letter read. “Decades of media consolidation have resulted in a handful of companies controlling what stories are told on television.

Comcast said on Wednesday that it too was in support of net neutrality. But the company doesn’t see the fight the same way as activists. It, and Verizon in its own statement, emphasized a desire to scrap what they see as 1930s-style utility regulation in favor of updated legislation. “We wanted to reinforce today — to the public, our customers, regulators and legislators — what we’ve been saying and doing for years. We support permanent, strong, legally enforceable net neutrality rules,” David Cohen, Comcast’s chief diversity officer in open internet, said. “For more than a decade this issue has been characterized primarily by slogans and rhetoric, and this has not led to protection of the open Internet on a permanent and predictable basis,” Verizon added in its response the day of action. “So we respectfully suggest that real action will involve people coming together to urge Congress to pass net neutrality legislation once and for all.” ","Netflix, Amazon, Twitter and others band together in protest of possible net neutrality rule reversal - MarketWatch",0.9959
106,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc’s quarterly results topped analysts’ estimates as the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier on Wednesday reported record low customer attrition and said it was considering a quarterly dividend. T-Mobile has been gaining share from larger competitors AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc in a saturated U.S. wireless market through network improvements and lower prices. Shares rose 3 percent to $63.90 in after-hours trading. The company had said it was open to considering various strategic options and has acknowledged interest in talking with rival Sprint Corp about a merger. But such discussions appear to be on hold as Sprint explores other partnerships. Sources told Reuters in June that Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, had entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with cable companies Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp until the end of July. Sources also told Reuters that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp were exploring an investment of $10 billion to $20 billion in Sprint. “I would say we have the same but maybe more opportunities from an inorganic or an expansion standpoint than we had last quarter,” Chief Executive John Legere said on the company’s post-earnings conference call. In April, Legere said satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp had access to content and spectrum and noted Sprint had “an awful lot of scale.” Amazon.com Inc and internet companies should be considered because “they drive great value for shareholders,” he added. As for Sprint, “investors may begin to rethink whether they want a merger, or at least, whether they want one now,” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a note. Shares of T-Mobile and Sprint trade at similar multiples of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) despite T-Mobile’s stronger performance, he said. T-Mobile added 786,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the second quarter ended June 30, up from 646,000 in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected net additions of 607,000, according to research firm FactSet. Churn, or customer defections, was 1.1 percent, a record low. “We’re actually starting to have conversations about instituting a small quarterly dividend that we can grow in the future,” Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said on the call. Net income rose to $581 million, or 67 cents per share, from $225 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.    Total revenue grew to $10.21 billion from $9.29 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $9.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ","

107,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tech companies clashed with internet service providers on Monday over whether a landmark 2015 net neutrality order barring the blocking or slowing of web content should be scrapped by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The Internet Association said in its filing with the FCC that dismantling the rules “will create significant uncertainty in the market and upset the careful balance that has led to the current virtuous circle of innovation in the broadband ecosystem.” Comcast said the order “represented an unfortunate, unnecessary, and profoundly unwise wrong-turn for the broadband economy and consumers more broadly.” AT&T said the FCC in 2015 “grossly exaggerated the need for public-utility-style regulation while ignoring its costs.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to weigh in on Monday, noting the FCC was an independent agency. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the former Obama administration’s order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. Pai has asked that if in the event the FCC reverses that order, whether it has the authority or should keep any regulations limiting internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer  “fast lanes” to some websites, known as “paid prioritization.” Pai, who argues the Obama order was unnecessary and harms jobs and investment, has not committed to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” The Internet Association said there was “no reliable evidence” that investment by providers had fallen. Twelve state attorneys general including from Illinois and California urged the FCC not to overturn the Obama rules, saying that would “expose consumers to the risk that their internet access will be interfered with and disrupted.” More than 8.4 million public comments have been filed on the proposal. Pai will face questions on Wednesday on the issue at a U.S. Senate hearing. Providers say they strongly support open internet rules and will not block or throttle legal websites even without legal requirements. But some providers have said paid prioritization may make sense at times, citing self-driving cars and healthcare information. The Internet Association said it was “open to alternative legal bases for the rules, either via legislative action codifying the existing net neutrality rules or via sound legal theories offered by the commission.” But it said Pai’s proposal “offers no clear alternatives.” ","

108,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp said on Friday that it was launching new leasing options aimed at price-sensitive customers who want to upgrade their phones more often, the carrier’s latest effort to lure subscribers in an oversaturated market for wireless service. The No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier will now allow customers to lease any phone and have the option to upgrade it after a year. Previously, the option was only available for Apple Inc iPhones and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s Galaxy devices. At 18 months, customers can either return their old phones and upgrade to new ones or purchase their devices. Those who want to buy their phones can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum or in six monthly increments. “We want to give full flexibility to our customers because you don’t want to get stuck with an old phone,” Robert Hackl, Sprint’s senior vice president of leasing, said in an interview. The changes come at a time when the U.S. wireless market is becoming increasingly competitive, and carriers are battling each other to lure customers through new deals. Verizon Communications Inc in February reintroduced unlimited data plans for the first time in more than five years. Earlier this year, Sprint began offering five lines of unlimited data for $90, cheaper than competitors’ plans. In June, it launched a promotion for free unlimited data, talk and text for a year for customers who bring their own devices. Sprint is the only carrier that leases devices to customers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s about lowering the cost for the consumer,” he said. “What’s in it for the carrier is people with new devices are happier. They are getting access to the new capabilities of the network.” The company, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp , is believed to be exploring a tie-up with rival T-Mobile US Inc. Sprint has also entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp on a wireless deal that would allow the cable companies to use its network. “Considering that they’re more in an M&A mindset, they need a growing company,” Entner said, of Sprint executives. “Nothing draws more customers into the door than low prices.” ","

109,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo started as a pioneer and wound up a mere holding company. Uber Technologies could be embarking on the same path. In the heady days of 1999, Yahoo’s market value soared beyond $100 billion. Last month, the company offloaded the last vestiges of its online business to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion. What’s left under the rebranded $56 billion Altaba is stakes acquired long ago in Jack Ma’s Chinese e-commerce goliath Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, along with about $11 billion of net cash. Meanwhile, legal and regulatory roadblocks keep piling up for Uber on top of a workplace-culture fiasco that has left the company, last valued at some $68 billion, without its co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, among other senior-level gaps. As it struggles to preserve its app-driven ride service and build fledgling logistics and autonomous-vehicle businesses, Uber has begun rounding up positions in some promising far-flung markets, too. It parlayed a cash-burning Chinese operation into a roughly 18 percent stake in rival Didi Chuxing last year. That stake alone is worth around $8 billion based on a recent $5.5 billion Didi fundraising that valued the whole company at $50 billion. Earlier this month, Uber did something similar in Russia, abandoning cutthroat competition with local rival Yandex in favor of 37 percent ownership in a new combined service, a stake initially valued at well over $1 billion. The two interests add up to approaching $10 billion. Meanwhile, Uber’s overall worth is declining. On the secondary market, it dipped to $50 billion in June, according to TechCrunch. It wouldn’t be surprising if it’s still falling following Kalanick’s ouster. A new fundraising in April for Lyft, Uber’s primary U.S. rival, pegged its value at $7.5 billion. Suppose Uber’s larger American business is worth twice that, and its China and Russia stakes soon appreciate by 50 percent. Ignoring Uber’s efforts in other countries, some of which eventually could become additional stakes, it would add up to a $30 billion company, with half the value already accounted for by minority interests. Extrapolate a few more years, and it’s not hard to see Uber becoming the next Altaba. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

111,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"NUEVA YORK/WASHINGTON - Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc y decenas de grandes empresas de tecnología más protestaron online el miércoles contra los cambios a las leyes de neutralidad de la red de EEUU, que prohíben a los proveedores de banda ancha otorgar o vender acceso a algunos servicios de Internet y a otros no. Apoyando al “Día de la Acción por el Internet para Salvar a la Neutralidad de la Red”, más de 80.000 páginas web - desde grandes plataformas de redes sociales como Facebook hasta servicios de streaming como Netflix y webs de citas como OkCupid - están desplegando pancartas, alertas, anuncios y clips de vídeo para alentar al público a que se oponga a la derogación de las emblemáticas leyes de 2015 por la neutralidad de la red. La neutralidad de la red es un principio que prohíbe que los proveedores de banda ancha otorguen o vendan acceso a Internet rápido, esencialmente lo que vendría a ser una “vía rápida”, a algunos servicios de internen y a otros no. La ley fue implementada en 2015 por la administración del anterior presidente, el demócrata Barack Obama. Cambios a esta legislación están siendo propuestos por el director de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de EEUU (FCC, por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, nombrado en enero por el actual presidente, el republicano Donald Trump. Pai quiere que la comisión revoque las leyes que reclasificaron a los proveedores de Internet como si fuesen servicios públicos, alegando que las leyes del Internet abierto adoptadas por Obama dañan el empleo y la inversión. La FCC votó 2 a 1 en mayo dar inicio a un plan republicano que derogase la orden de “neutralidad de la red”. Durante un discurso en abril, Pai preguntó: “¿Queremos que el gobierno controle el Internet?¿O queremos acoger la estrategia de tacto fino (en vigor desde 1996 hasta que fue revisada en 2015)?”. En una rueda de prensa en Capitol Hill, demócratas y empresas de Internet se comprometieron a luchar contra los cambios y sugirieron que las empresas de Internet podrían ralentizar la velocidad de red. El senador Edward Markey dijo que el Internet “está siendo atacado”. “No vamos a dejar que este asalto ocurra”, dijo Markey. “Un Internet libre y abierto es nuestro derecho y lucharemos por defenderlo”. Grandes proveedores de banda ancha, incluyendo a AT&T Inc y Verizon Communications Inc, reconocieron el apoyo del público por la neutralidad de la red. Enfatizaron que estaban a favor de un “Internet abierto” pero dejaron claro que estaban contra la orden de reclasificación de la neutralidad de la red de 2015 que dijeron que, según ellos, podía llevar a la regulación gubernamental de los precios. El portavoz de la FCC Brian Hart rechazó comentar la cuestión. La comisionada de la FCC, Mignon Clyburn, la única demócrata en una comisión que cuenta con dos plazas vacantes, dijo en un comunicado el miércoles que apoya “a aquellos que creen que un Internet libre y abierto es un principio fundacional de nuestra democracia”. La ciudadanía tendrá hasta mediados de agosto para enviar comentarios a la FCC antes del voto final. ","

112,Todd Shriber,7202017,Investopedia,7132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Some well-known sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can confuse investors. For example, the FANG stocks are often associated with the technology sector, but Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) reside in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), not in the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). Likewise, telecommunications is one of the 11 sectors found in the S&P 500, but telecom giants AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) reside in XLK. The construction of passively managed sector ETFs could change next year if index giants S&P Global and MSCI Inc. (MSCI) move forward with the creation of a proposed communication services sector. S&P and MSCI, the two largest providers of indexes for use by ETF sponsors, have jointly proposed communication services as a new GICS sector. The latest addition to the GICS lineup occurred last year when real estate was separated from financial services, marking the creation of the 11th S&P 500 sector. MSCI and S&P announced that move in 2014. (See also: GICS vs. ICB: Competing Systems for Classifying Stocks.) ""The proposed communication services sector could include companies in the aforementioned Telecom Sector including AT&T and Verizon,"" said CFRA Research Director of ETF and Mutual Fund Research Todd Rosenbluth in a note out Monday. Rosenbluth added that current members of XLY that could join the new communication services sector include well-known names such as Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), The Walt Disney Company (DIS) and Netflix. Likewise, XLK, the largest technology ETF, could see Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook, Inc. (FB) move to the communication services sector. Facebook and Alphabet combine for about 18% of XLK's weight. (See also: A Look at the Technology Sector SPDR ETF.) ""Based on CFRA's initial review of the proposed changes, we think AMZN could stay in the Consumer Discretionary sector along with Specialty Retail companies (17%) and Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure firms (14%),"" said the analyst. Amazon accounts for 15.5% of XLY's weight, more than double the weight assigned to Comcast, the ETF's second largest holding. While Amazon has long been assigned to the consumer discretionary sector, the company's dominant presence in the cloud computing space bolsters the argument that it could eventually be separated from its current sector designation in favor of technology or communication services. (See also: 5 ETFs With Amazon Exposure.) Last week, S&P and MSCI unveiled the consultation on the communication services sector, which would lead to the creation of a new industry group, two industries and a sub-industry, according to a statement from the index providers.

Or is this price decline a harbinger of more trouble ahead? The answers to these questions will likely depend on how well Verizon responds to the following challenges. In a largely saturated U.S. wireless market, the major carriers are locked in a battle for market share. Customers must be wrestled away from the competition to spur growth, and the ensuing struggle has ushered in a vicious price war. After initially resisting pressure from rival T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) to offer an unlimited plan, Verizon relented in the face of significant wireless customer losses. Verizon previously chose to compete on the strength of its network, which is widely considered best in class. But that advantage has lessened in recent years, as T-Mobile has steadily improved the quality of its wireless network. In fact, some studies now place T-Mobile's network on par with Verizon's. So Verizon was forced to join its rival in offering customers what they crave most: more data for less money. Unfortunately, while Verizon's new unlimited plan has helped to stem its customer losses, it's also dented its average revenue per user (ARPU) metrics. That's because many of Verizon's customers who switched to its unlimited plan were paying more for their previous data plans. In turn, this has pressured Verizon's revenue and profitability. Verizon expects ARPU trends to stabilize later this year, as new customers who come in on its new unlimited plan -- which is more expensive than some of the data plans it previously offered to new subscribers -- are expected to offset the decline from existing customers that lower their bills by switching to unlimited. This is an important trend that bears watching by investors, and one that will go a long way toward determining Verizon's future profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon may not be the first company that comes to mind when thinking about those most impacted by the rising number of cable cancellations, but with its FiOS business still accounting for about 10% of its total revenue, it's a serious threat nonetheless. Cord-cutting appears to be accelerating, as the plethora of online streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu is making it easier for more people to go without traditional cable TV. This trend is likely to only get worse for cable providers, as 10.8 million more customers are expected to cut the cord over the next five years -- up from 1.9 million in 2016 -- according to research group SNL Kagan. That's bad news for Verizon, whose FiOS TV segment has long been a source of growth. Recently, however, Verizon has begun to bleed customers -- including 13 million FiOS video subscribers in the first quarter -- as cord-cutting's impact has worsened. In response to these trends, Verizon sold off some of its FiOS assets in April of last year, sparking some analysts to wonder if it would be best served by exiting the pay TV business altogether. Yet for the time being at least, it appears that Verizon intends to keep its remaining FiOS assets. Verizon intends to counter cord-cutting by launching its own streaming service later this year. Of note, however, is that Verizon's previous attempts at online video have not gone well, and over-the-top video services typically carry lower profit margins than traditional cable. Worse still, Verizon's new streaming video offering is likely to at least partially cannibalize its existing FiOS TV business, although that's probably better than Verizon having its lunch eaten by its competitors. On a more positive note, Verizon's online video services would not be bound by the same regional constraints of its FiOS infrastructure, thereby allowing it to offer its streaming package on national basis. Yet there's likely to be fierce competition in this crowded arena, and rivals Sling TV and DirecTV Now already have a sizable head start. Still, having a competitive streaming service should only grow in importance as more and more consumers ditch their traditional pay TV packages in the years ahead. That makes Verizon's success in the streaming wars another area that investors should monitor closely. ","

117,Joe Tenebruso,7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported second-quarter results on July 19. The No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier delivered strong revenue and profit growth fueled by what are likely to be industry-leading customer gains. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $10.213 billion $9.287 billion 10% Net income $581 million $225 million 158% Earnings per share $0.67 $0.25 168% Data source: T-Mobile Q2 2017 earnings release (opens PDF). T-Mobile added 1.3 million net new customers, bringing its total subscriber count to 69.6 million and extending its streak of adding more than 1 million customers to 17 consecutive quarters. T-Mobile added 817,000 total postpaid subscribers -- who pay monthly bills and are typically the most sought-after customers for wireless carriers -- during the second quarter, including 786,000 net postpaid phone customers. T-Mobile expects these figures to lead the industry for the sixth consecutive quarter -- a notable accomplishment considering that industry leader Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) finally succumbed to the pressure of customer losses and began offering unlimited data plans earlier this year. Yet while Verizon may have slowed its subscriber defections, it didn't stop them, and now it appears that it also didn't halt T-Mobile's market-share gains. T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image Source: T-Mobile. CEO John Legere, who once again pulled no punches in his press-release statement, said that T-Mobile also gained the upper hand in network speeds after Verizon and fellow industry titan AT&T (NYSE:T) moved to match T-Mobile's unlimited data offerings. ""Our network just keeps getting better and faster while the Duopoly's networks seem to be choking after we forced them to go unlimited,"" Legere said. ""Make no mistake about it, the Un-carrier will not stop forcing change in this industry and our Q2 results are more proof that consumers are responding!"" To Legere's point, consumers do seem to be responding favorably to T-Mobile's offerings, as evidenced by both its industry-leading new-subscriber additions and its record low postpaid phone churn -- or customer defections -- which fell to 1.10%, down 17 basis points compared to the prior-year period. In all, T-Mobile's strong customer retention and subscriber growth fueled a 10% year-over-year increase in total revenue, to $10.2 billion. In turn, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring items -- jumped 19%, to $3 billion. Adjusted net income surged 158%, to $581 million, or $0.67 per share. These results prompted T-Mobile to boost its full-year subscriber-growth forecast to a range of 3.0 million to 3.6 million branded postpaid net additions, up from previous estimates of 2.8 million to 3.5 million. The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion from $10.4 billion to $10.8 billion. Peering out even further into the future, T-Mobile remains confident in its ability to grow its operating and free cash flow at annualized rates of 15% to 18% and 45% to 48%, respectively, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019. Legere also made some predictions during T-Mobile's earnings conference call: I predict that T-Mobile will be the only provider to grow total wireless revenues by double digits year-over-year. I predict that we'll be the only carrier to grow wireless service revenues at all year-over-year. And I predict that we will take all of the industry's postpaid phone growth again, at the same time achieving record profitability and strong free cash flow growth. While these are bold statements, T-Mobile has a history of delivering on Legere's promises. ","
      
    T-Mobile US Earnings Surge on 1.3 Million Subscriber Additions -- The Motley Fool

118,Daniel B. Kline,7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Both Frontier (NASDAQ:FTR) and Sprint (NYSE:S) sit in similar positions in their respective markets. The two companies are well behind the established market leaders with little reason for anyone to expect a major comeback. In addition, both companies may be worth more as an acquisition than they are as a stand-alone company. On top of that, Frontier and Sprint operate in markets that require significant investments just to keep pace. That's a challenging position for two money-losing companies to be in, but both brands do have potential upside. It's reasonable to say that neither company represents a great buy. Both face an uphill battle against long odds, but there is a clear better buy between the companies. Image source: YCharts. Frontier wanted to be a bigger player and it spent $10.54 billion to do that buying Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That move did make the company bigger and give it an economy of scale, but so far the purchase has been a disaster. The company paid dearly to acquire 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers from Verizon in April 2016. It has lost some of those subscribers in each quarter since the CTF deal closed. That's troubling news and while CEO Daniel McCarthy tells analysts and shareholders every quarter that it will change, the losses keep mounting. In Q4, when Frontier reported the loss of 144,000 more residential customers as well as 14,000 business customers, McCarthy blamed the drop on Frontier getting rid of former Verizon customers who had not paid their bills. ""This process is almost complete, and we expect to return to a normalized trend by the start of the second quarter,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release. ""I am pleased that underlying CTF customer trends improved in Q4 and continue to improve in Q1."" That did not happen. and the numbers actually got worse. In Q1, Frontier lost 155,000 residential customers and 18,000 business customers. In addition, Frontier just completed a 1-for-15 reverse split and it has cut its dividend. Those are not positive changes, but the CTF purchase did succeed in one key area -- it's helping the company spend less money. The cable, phone, and internet provider reached its ""target of $1.25 billion in total annualized synergies by end of Q1 2017, and remains on track to deliver an additional $350 million by end of Q2 2018,"" according to the Q1 earnings release. That buys the company time and makes it a more attractive acquisition. It's also plausible that Frontier has already hit bottom. The company's stock, as you can see above, has already absorbed the blows from continual subscriber drops, the reverse split, and the dividend cut. As you can see below, the market has been kinder to Sprint than it has Frontier. That's partly because the company has managed modest growth in postpaid subscribers for each of the past four quarters, but it's mostly because the company has become an attractive takeover target. Image source: YCharts. Sprint had been talking about reviving its once-planned merger with T-Mobile. That deal, which faces some major regulatory hurdles, has been put on hold while Sprint enters an exclusive negotiating period with Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Those talks could result in a purchase, but that's not overly likely. Instead, the two cable giants are likely to invest in Sprint's network to beef it up to support their fledgling efforts to offer wireless service. Sprint has been very aggressive with its ads using former Verizon spokesperson Paul Marcarelli. Image source: Sprint. Sprint's biggest problem has been that T-Mobile had already staked out the territory as the alternative to wireless's biggest players. That made it hard for the number four carrier to add customers without resorting to major price cuts, which are risky in a market where consumers can leave after the promotional period ends. The likely support of Charter and Comcast could help stabilize Sprint. In addition, an investment from those companies will lessen its infrastructure expense while helping it grow subscriber counts. That makes Sprint the better buy even though its stock has moved very shakily upwards for the year. The wireless carrier simply has more options to turn around its business while Frontier faces a greater risk of going to zero. Multiple major players want at least a piece of Sprint. That should drive its price up were it to eventually sell and it gives the company leverage Frontier does not have. ","

119,"Travis Hoium, Timothy Green, and Cory Renauer",7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The stock market can seem to fall in and out of love with stocks at a moment's notice, creating great buying opportunities for investors. And sometimes it doesn't seem that valuations make any sense at all. Our Foolish investors have found three stocks they think the market is completely missing the boat on. Here's why they picked Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI), Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Tim Green (Hanesbrands): With so many headlines dedicated to the largest companies, it can be easy to forget that there are thousands of U.S. stocks available. It's impossible to keep up with all of them, so it's not surprising that the market misses the boat on some solid investment opportunities. Hanesbrands, which owns well-known apparel brands including Hanes, Champion, Playtex, and Wonderbra, is one such company. Shares of Hanesbrands took a dive earlier this year when revenue and earnings came up short of expectations, but they've been slowly moving higher since. The stock is still well below its peak reached in 2015, but it could find its way back if the company can put together a string of positive earnings reports. HBI data by YCharts. Hanesbrands' core innerwear business is in a funk, with sales down 5.9% year over year during the first quarter. The activewear business performed better, with sales rising by 3.4%, and international sales surged 71% thanks to acquisitions. The ongoing shift of retail sales online presents a challenge for Hanesbrands, with the company blaming weak retail traffic for the innerwear decline. Analysts are expecting Hanesbrands' to grow revenue by 6.9% this year and produce adjusted EPS of $1.98. That puts the PE ratio at just about 11.5. While the upheaval in the retail industry creates some uncertainty, shares of Hanesbrands look like a good deal for investors willing to ride out the storm. Cory Renauer (Masimo Corporation): This hidden medical technology gem doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves. The stock has soared about 281% over the past three years, but it's still flying under Wall Street's radar. Just three analysts bothered tuning in for the company's latest quarterly earnings call. Wall Street may be missing the boat on the new leader of oxygen monitoring devices, but that doesn't mean it's too late for individual investors to climb aboard. In fact, I'd argue that Masimo's best days lay ahead. Although you've probably never heard of the company, you've almost certainly been attached to one of its oximetry devices (or at least one that contains noninvasive vital sign monitoring technology owned by Masimo). In the years ahead, it might be nearly impossible to find a hospital, long-term care center, or primary care provider that doesn't employ a Masimo product. After successfully protecting its intellectual property from infringement by the Dutch device giant Koninklijke Philips, the former rival is now a major partner. Philips makes IntelliVue monitors, which monitor a patient's breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. New versions of the ubiquitous monitors will also provide healthcare providers with constant measurements of important blood oxygen information that previously required an invasive blood draw. While Masimo will see a direct bump in sales from the monitors, the long-term effect of integrating this technology into the popular patient monitors could be huge. Philips represents more than half of the high-acuity monitoring market. Once healthcare providers around the globe become familiar with the benefits of constant oximetry monitoring, they're likely going to drive demand for Masimo's products through the roof. Travis Hoium (Verizon Communications): It may sound crazy that the market is missing the boat on a company worth $177 billion, but I think that's the case with Verizon. Since 2000, Verizon's stock is down 27% while revenue more than doubled and net income rose 58%. But where I think the market is missing the boat is the incredible potential of 5G technology, where Verizon will be a clear leader. The number of connected devices is already surging, and according to Gartner, connected things will increase 31% to 8.4 billion in 2017. Cisco's Visual Networking Index takes that a step further and predicts that 27.1 billion devices will be connected by 2021 and the average American will have 23 connected devices. 23! Right now, most of the increase in connected devices is coming in the home and from static devices like smart TVs or connected machines in a factory that don't require a cell network. But 5G speed of 10 gigabits per second (as much as 1,000 times faster than LTE) or more will absolutely change the game for connected devices. It will enable self-driving cars on a broad scale, a new level of virtual reality, and innovations that haven't even been thought of yet. With arguably the best network in the U.S., Verizon will be at the center of the 5G revolution. And that's an incredible growth opportunity for a stock trading at just 14.6 times trailing earnings with a 5.4% dividend yield. ","
      
    3 Stocks the Market Is Missing the Boat On -- The Motley Fool

120,Anders Bylund,7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) fell 28% in 2016 and another 66% in the first half of 2017. The regional telecom's financial results have been a mixed bag lately, and Frontier recently slashed its dividend payments by 62%. Are shares a buy after these adjustments, or should investors still stay away from Frontier Communications stock? Let's start with a quick dividend analysis, because Frontier has been an income investor's best friend for many years. The stock's lowest yield in the last 10 years was a still-generous 4.9% in the spring of 2015, and Frontier's yields raced higher than 20% as share prices plunged in early 2017. That's where Frontier's management took action. Dividend Pay Date Payout Per Share (split-adjusted) Total Dividend Cost Cash Payout Ratio June 30, 2015 $1.575 $106 million 53% Sept. 30, 2015 $1.575 $189 million 83% Dec. 31, 2015 $1.575 $176 million 72% March 31, 2016 $1.575 $177 million 95% June 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 70% Sept. 30, 2016 $1.575 $178 million 106% Dec. 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 101% March 31, 2017 $1.575 $178 million 56% June 30, 2017 $0.60 $68 million (estimated) 28% (estimated) Data sources: Dividend.com and Frontier Communications. After holding steady at $1.575 per split-adjusted share for more than two years, Frontier's quarterly dividend was lowered to $0.60 per share in an announcement on May 2, 2017. At the same time, the company also approved a previously announced 15-for-1 reverse share split and reported disappointing first-quarter results. Share prices fell 22% over the next couple of days as investors digested the one-two punch of lower payouts and continued customer losses. Frontier CEO Dan McCarthy explained that the dividend needed to slow down in order to give Frontier more financial flexibility. ""As we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver on the full potential of our strong assets and generate additional cash flow, we will optimize our capital allocation to ensure we strike a balance between investing in the business, paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders,"" he said. So Frontier's dividend is down, and the company's cash flows have been earmarked for debt repayments rather than payout increases. Frontier's effective dividend yield remains generous due to sliding share prices, but you shouldn't expect any dividend payment boosts out of the company's management anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. McCarthy talks a good game, and promises to have his company back on solid financial ground soon enough. But Frontier often falls short of its own guidance targets and management needs to be held to its promises here. This is not made easier by the fact that Frontier is having trouble providing acceptable levels of service to its new customers in Florida, California, and Texas -- the three large markets the company acquired in a $10.5 billion deal with Verizon Communications in 2016. So I would take Dan McCarthy's rosy debt reduction talk with a grain of salt. That doesn't make dividend increases any more likely, either. In fact, it's probably a good idea to stay away from Frontier Communications stock altogether. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    Is Frontier Communications Stock a Buy? -- The Motley Fool

121,Adam Levy,7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. At the beginning of the year, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) said it planned to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores, expanding its retail footprint to catch up with its network expansion. After the first quarter, T-Mobile had to update its outlook to 1,500 T-Mobile stores. T-Mobile's VP of Sales Jon Freier tweeted this week the company has opened 1,000 stores already this year, surpassing its original goal. The footprint expansion represents a huge opportunity for T-Mobile. While the company has been able to continue stealing away customers from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), expanding its footprint outside of major metro areas presents additional upside for the wireless carrier. Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile expects its new stores to cover 30 million to 40 million new people. What's more, the competition in the areas where T-Mobile is opening new stores is much less intense than the metro areas it currently operates, giving T-Mobile a good opportunity to take market share. T-Mobile already has strong brand recognition in these markets thanks to its national advertising campaigns, so it should be able to quickly capture market share. CFO Braxton Carter said a market share in the teens is achievable within a five-year time frame. That could mean an additional 5 million customers or so over the next five years just from the stores it's opening this year. That growth will be in addition to the customers T-Mobile is still bringing in from the two-thirds of the country it covered with its retail stores in 2016. That growth is still going strong, with T-Mobile adding 1.3 million customers in the first quarter between T-Mobile and MetroPCS. That's four straight years of adding over 1 million customers every quarter. Expanding its retail footprint also gives T-Mobile room to increase its pricing as it's now competing for a larger market. The company recently increased the price of its ONE Plus plan, putting it roughly in line with Verizon's unlimited plan. That could be just the start of price increases at T-Mobile as it starts to focus on cash flow. But T-Mobile just set a record low postpaid churn rate in its first quarter. Combined with the new greenfield markets its retail operations are expanding into, it can afford to see its net additions in existing markets wane a bit. Importantly, existing customers can keep their current pricing for as long as they keep their current plans. That should help keep churn rate low. So, not only do T-Mobile's new store openings support customer growth, they support average revenue per user growth for the carrier. With the broadest retail footprints in the country, AT&T and Verizon are going to be the biggest losers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Both companies have been bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile for years now. AT&T is relying on bundle economics to keep customers from leaving. It's offering all unlimited plan customers $25 off a DIRECTV package, and Unlimited Plus customers also get free HBO on any AT&T video service. Verizon is relying on the strength of its brand and its network, which still regularly ranks atop the four national carriers in independent studies. Verizon may also launch a nationwide video streaming service later this year that it could bundle. But consumers are cutting the cord more than ever, so it's not clear how much a bundle will help. That said, Verizon is better positioned than AT&T to hold onto its customers as T-Mobile enters new markets. Nonetheless, both companies must remain aggressive, as the competition in the industry remains fierce. ","
      
    T-Mobile Is Opening Stores at a Breakneck Pace -- The Motley Fool

122,Brian Feroldi,7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Interest rates have been hovering near historic lows for several years now. That's a big problem for retirees, many of whom depend on income from their investments to help finance their lifestyles, and who may prefer interest-paying assets like bonds due to their low risk. But poor returns from those ""safe"" assets have incentivized some income investors to put money in the highest-yielding stocks they can find in order to generate decent level of regular returns. This might sound like an attractive plan, but it can actually be a risky strategy. Too many stocks wind up with impressive-looking yields because their shares have been punished, often justifiably, by the market. The business itself may not be able to sustain such a payout much longer, and falling stocks may have further to fall. Image source: Getty Images. Recognizing all this, let's put the 10 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 to the test to figure out if any of them could be worth buying today. Company Ticker Dividend Yield Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) 16.3% CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) 9.4% Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) 7% Macy's (NYSE:M) 6.8% Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 6.4% Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) 5.7% AT&T (NYSE:T) 5.4% Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) 5.3% L. Brands (NYSE:LB) 5.3% Ford (NYSE:F) 5.1% Data source: Finviz, as of July 17, 2017. This list excludes REITs. Smart income investors know that the first metric that they should look at when considering any high-yield dividend stock is its payout ratio. This figure is calculated by dividing the company's last 12 months of net income by its total dividend payout. The end result will tell investors what fraction of a company's profits are being used to cover the dividend. While this statistic is far from a perfect gauge -- one-time charges can sometimes heavily bias earnings downward -- it does provide investors with a quick way to measure a dividend's sustainability. Here's how these 10 companies stack up: Company Payout Ratio Frontier Communications NM CenturyLink 212% Mattel 190% Macy's 82% Seagate Technology 104% Kohl's 60% AT&T 95% Verizon Communications 77% L. Brands 63% Ford 64% Table source: Yahoo! Finance. NM = not meaningful; these companies reported losses over the past 12 months. A quick glance at the table above shows just how useful the payout ratio can be at helping you cull your list of potential investments. Frontier Communication hasn't even reported a profit over the last twelve months, which is why it doesn't have a payout ratio. After factoring in that it recently slashed its dividend by 62%, I'm content to eliminate the company from contention. Investors should be equally wary of investing in CenturyLink, Mattel, or Seagate Technology. All three of these companies are paying out more in dividends than they are earning in net income, which isn't a sustainable practice over the long term. That makes me believe they should also be excluded from further consideration. If a company's payout ratio looks sustainable, then I next like to get a sense of its growth potential. In my judgement, a dividend stock is only attractive if it can increase its payout over time. No company can do that long term without a growing profit stream. One quick way to gauge a company's growth potential is to look at both its historic rate of growth and its forecast growth rate over the next five years. While this method isn't foolproof, it does give us a sense of a where a company has been and where it could be going. Here's how our remaining six companies stack up in this area: Company Actual Earnings Growth Over Past 5 Years (Annualized) Estimated Earnings Growth Over Next 5 Years (Annualized) Macy's (5.1%) 18.6% Kohl's (4.1%) 5.3% AT&T 4.3% 7% Verizon Communications 12.4% 2.5% L. Brands Ford Data source: Yahoo! Finance. As you can see, big box retailers Macy's and Kohl's have seen their profits head in the wrong direction over the last five years. While there are a number of factors in play here -- declining mall traffic, discounting by competing bankrupt retailers, the rise of e-commerce -- the overall result has been shrinking net income. That's troubling, but it is interesting to see that Wall Street believes that both retailers will post healthy profit gains over the next five years -- Macy's in particular. That bullishness likely stems in part from the company's willingness to close underperforming stores and monetize its real estate assets. If that forecast growth rate can be believed, Macy's could certainly be worth considering. AT&T and Verizon Communications have both produced consistent growth over time, which makes sense given their dominance of the U.S. wireless industry. It is noteworthy that Verizon's profits have grown at a double-digit rate while Ma Bell's gains have been more muted. However, analysts expect that AT&T will be the faster grower from here, a view that likely stems from its recent purchase of DirecTV and its pending merger with Time Warner. If that merger gets the green light, then the company should have ample opportunity to grow revenue and cut costs, both of which could lead to an expanding bottom line. L. Brands, the retail company behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, has managed to keep its profits moving in the right direction in spite of facing the same issues that have plagued its big-box competition. Beyond its brand strength, one explanation for its success could be the company's big push into e-commerce. Last year, the company sold nearly $2 billion worth of products through its direct channels, representing about 16% of total sales. The company's growth plans call for a continued emphasis on online sales, and an intense push to grow its store count in China. If those moves pay off, then shareholders could certainly benefit. Meanwhile, analysts are predicting that Ford's profit trend will shift into reverse over the coming years. That view likely stems from worries that North American auto sales have peaked, plus concerns about it recent sudden change in leadership, and the long-term threats posed by electric and autonomous vehicles. New CEO Jim Hackett will have his work cut out for him in terms of changing Wall Street's outlook on Ford's. While these stocks are far from risk-free, and each has its own unique set of pluses and minuses, I must admit that Macy's and L. Brands are the two that interest me most from this list. Both companies can afford to make their dividend payments today, and could be in position to grow after the current wave of retail bankruptcies and store closures finally subsides. That's an intriguing combination that makes them worthy of further investigation. ","

A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. Our man, Steve Broido, will hit you with a question from the other side of the glass. David Kretzmann, you're up first. What are you looking at? David Kretzmann: I'm looking at Camping World Holdings, ticker CWH. RV sales in the U.S. are actually hitting the highest levels they've ever been at in about 40 years. As more baby boomers are retiring and younger people are trying to travel more while they're still young and working, RV sales are continuing to increase each year here in the U.S. Camping World Holdings is essentially the largest national retailer of RVs. They have 130 stores in 36 states, and they also own the Good Sam Club, which you can think of as the RV industry's membership club, kind of the AAA for RVs, and they have 1.7 million members in the Good Sam Club, which provides some high-margin recurring revenue for the company and keeps that relationship with their customers over time. There's a lot of mom-and-pop operators in this space, so what Camping World can do is acquire those mom-and-pop brands, rebrand them, and build this national RV brand under Camping World. So a lot of things to like here. It's a small cap, but I'm keeping a close eye on it. Hill: Steve, question about Camping World Holdings? Steve Broido: I'm legitimately fascinated with RVs. I have looked at them online. It's an interesting, interesting, interesting place to look, by the way. Would you go with a fifth wheel or a motor home? What are you going with? Kretzmann: Man, I am not an expert there, Steve. It depends on your respective circumstances. Broido: I'm going fifth wheel. Kretzmann: Fifth wheel, that sounds good. Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Jason Moser: Yeah, looking at Wayfair earnings coming out on Aug. 8. Ticker is W. I've been covering this business since it IPOed in 2014. It continues to perform, and all of the metrics seem to be going in the right direction. They're growing sales; they're growing users; margins are actually pretty steady. The big metric there is the percentage of orders from repeat customers, and that continues to appreciate over time. So then it's going to be a question of whether they can pull back on that acquisition at some point and really unleash some profitability in the business. There was a report of Amazon jumping into this line of work a month or so ago. It doesn't seem like that may be the Wayfair killer others thought it might be. But very interested in their quarter here. Hill: Steve, question about Wayfair? Broido: Is there a membership model in place here? Maybe like Restoration Hardware has done, where you become a member and you get a discount? That kind of thing? Moser: There is not yet. I do believe they have something in the mix there to try to develop a little bit more loyalty. Hill: Matty Argersinger, what are you looking at? Matt Argersinger: One stock recently on my watch list is Live Nation Entertainment. The ticker is LYV. Yes, music streaming has been around for years. We talk about things like virtual reality. But in my mind, you just can't replace the experience of going to a live concert or sports event. Live Nation is the largest events, promotion ticketing company in the world. Last year, they promoted 26,300 events; 71 million fans came and attended. They also own Ticketmaster, by the way, which is the largest ticketing company in the world -- 480 million tickets last year. I just think there's a lot going for this company, and I like the idea of a live events business in this Amazon-disrupted world we're living in right now. Hill: Steve, question about Live Nation Entertainment? Broido: It's a question for Matt. What's the best concert you've ever attended? Argersinger: Oh my gosh. I'm going to go old school. I went to Bruce Springsteen about 15 years ago, right out of college. It was one of the best times I've ever had. Hill: What about you, Steve? Broido: I'm going with The Cure. I saw The Cure in 1989, Disintegration Tour, it was really solid. Hill: Three stocks. You got one you want to add to your watch list? Broido: I'm going camping, man. Kretzmann: All right! Broido: I'm buying an RV. Let's do it. Kretzmann: Sounds good, Steve. Hill: Kretzmann going to do the cooking for you on that trip? Broido: I hope so. Kretzmann: We'll go to Chipotle. ","
      
    The 3 Stocks on the MFM Team's Radar This Week -- The Motley Fool

124,Motley Fool Staff,7202017,Fool,7132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Jeff Bezos and company keep steamrolling ahead, and not just in the United States. The Fools talk international, the Echo Show, Target's (NYSE:TGT) upgraded guidance, and e-commerce more broadly. Plus, they discuss the direction of commercial real estate, and one company picking up a fair amount of the space that was left empty with so many retailers shrinking their brick-and-mortar footprints. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: From big banks to big retail, in this case Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Target, Amazon Prime Day resulted in the biggest single day of sales ever for Amazon. This comes the same week that Target CEO Brian Cornell raised guidance for the retailer, citing higher traffic in their stores. Matty, let's start with Amazon. Forget Black Friday, forget Cyber Monday. It really does seem like Prime Day is the most important day for them. Matt Argersinger: Right. Based on the expected growth rate of 60%, Amazon probably pulled in almost a billion dollars. Not bad for a random Tuesday in July. No, this has become a big event. It started out a couple years ago as, ""It's the 20th anniversary of Amazon; let's have some special discounts for Prime members."" Hill: And by the way, it didn't go that well. Argersinger: No, not initially. I remember the site being down for several hours during that first time they did it. But it's now become this phenomenon. Of course, for Amazon, it really is about getting people to join Prime, experience what they can get on Prime. And for me, I'm really watching how people are interacting with Amazon Fresh and the household-staples part of the business. I think Amazon's goal is to get more and more people into that, realizing that's how they can steal a lot more market share from grocery stores, et cetera. David Kretzmann: Yeah, I remember in previous years, other retailers, I think Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target included, tried to have their own competition against Prime Day on Prime Day to try to steal some of that share from Amazon, and that didn't really happen this year, but I'm just thinking back to the first quarter of this year, where Wal-Mart's online sales grew 69%, Target's online sales grew 22%, which pales in comparison to what Wal-Mart and Amazon are putting up. I would be curious to see what those online numbers look like for retailers like Wal-Mart and Target coming up. Hill: Again, you go back two years to when they first did this, as you said, Matty, the site was down, they got some criticism, and I think it was fair, in terms of a little bit of bait-and-switch going on, in terms of the products they were promoting that sold out very quickly, that sort of thing. But Jason, in just two years' time, as we should expect with Jeff Bezos and his team, they've really got it down pat now. You look at what they're promoting this time around; it's very much the Echo, and it really does telegraph where they see that device in people's homes and what it means for Amazon's business. Jason Moser: Yeah, and the pace they're rolling out in new apps and skills for the Echo, it's very impressive. I really feel like we're going to need to get an Echo show at our house just to test it out, for sheer selfless market research, Chris, I may have to buy one of those and come back and tell you how that thing works. Because I do like the Echo in our house. We have a Dot as well. It's neat to see its functionality. I think the Echo Show gives them an opportunity to incorporate a bit more e-commerce. I think that's maybe one of the holdups there in making purchases with the Echo -- you're not quite sure what exactly you're getting; you can't make that visual confirmation. But I also think with Prime Day, it's really important to note that this is beyond just our domestic economy. It's very easy for us to look at it from a U.S.-centric perspective. But really, this rolled out Prime Day to 13 countries this year. This is where I think the real opportunity for Amazon still exists. They're investing so much in those international operations, and they're delivering those operating losses today. But remember 10 years ago, that's what it looked like here. So it's not too big of a leap to think that in 10 years, they're going to have a very impressive global e-commerce infrastructure and operation going that could reward shareholders for many years to come. Argersinger: You could see, as big as Prime Day was, maybe a billion in sales for Amazon, it pales in comparison to Singles Day in China, which is an Alibaba phenomenon on Nov. 11 every year, where they did $18 billion in sales. And I'm just wondering if Jeff Bezos was thinking to himself, ""Prime Day, eventually I think could be this worldwide thing where we pull in tens of billions of dollars in sales, and this is just the start of it."" Moser: It's a nice lever to pull! Hill: In some ways, probably not as surprising that they had this big of a day when you think about what Target did, just in terms of retail, David. Target's news this week, the guidance raise, the subsequent pop in Target's stock, it was almost like a sigh of relief on Wall Street, because for all of Amazon's success, Target is still a big player in this space, as is Wal-Mart, as is Costco. So you look at Costco's recent June sales, Target raising their guidance -- Amazon has a bright future, but these bricks and mortar power players are doing pretty well. Kretzmann: I think Wal-Mart especially, they've made numerous acquisitions, including Jet.com and Bonobos, another fashion online retailer that they bought within the last couple months. As I mentioned, their online sales in the latest quarter were up almost 70%, which is phenomenal. And they have almost the same amount of items on their platform online compared to Amazon, so they're making a lot of progress there. Target is more treading water, I think, even though their online sales were up 22% in the latest quarter. Compared to what Amazon in Wal-Mart are dealing with, Target is going to have to step up their game, and I think there's still a lot of questions there, even with their slightly raised guidance for this upcoming quarter. Argersinger: So Target is all excited about their restock program, which is, essentially, next-day delivery service that they're rolling out or testing in Minneapolis. Compare that to Prime, where you get same-day delivery in 5,000 cities around the world, and here's Target, ""We're testing next-day delivery in Minneapolis."" Kretzmann: Revolutionary! [laughs] Argersinger: ""We're excited about what this could do for our business."" You guys are 10 years behind by now. Hill: They get a lot of snow up there, though. You can't expect everything the same day. Argersinger: That's true. Hill: David, you and I were talking before we started taping today. One of the ripple effects -- and we don't really get into it all that much on this show -- you think about commercial real estate, when we look at the big retail trends, and a lot of well-known retailers closing stores and, in some cases, going out of business. In some cases, all of a sudden, that commercial real estate becomes really cheap. You mentioned something that really surprised me, which is that T-Mobile, of all companies, has opened a thousand locations so far in 2017. How have they done that? Kretzmann: Apparently they're finding someplace to put those stores. Maybe they're filling up the space that's opening up as all these other retailers and restaurants close up shop. They initially had guided to open a thousand new stores total in 2017. This is coming off a base of 2,000 stores at the end of last year. But they hit that mark earlier this week. By the middle of the year, essentially, they reached that mark, and now they're saying, ""We're going to open 1,500 total stores this year."" Their existing store base now covers about two-thirds of the U.S., and now this will really help boost their store coverage outside of the main metro areas in the country. This is a company that has, over the past four years, each quarter they've added at least one million new customers, stealing customers from Verizon and AT&T bit by bit. They also have a record low churn rate as of the latest quarter. So, a lot of things going well for T-Mobile. They're in full-on expansion mode. ","
      
    Prime Day Was Amazon's Best Day Ever, but Target and Wal-Mart Aren't Hurting -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9965
125,Michael Brush,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Published: July 20, 2017 4:54 p.m. ET Five areas of the global market will benefit from a weak greenback By Republicans tripped up the U.S. dollar this week by failing to make progress on replacing Obamacare. This hurt the greenback by casting doubts on other reforms promised by President Donald Trump — including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Big picture, the GOP’s Obamacare setback is really only part of the problem for the dollar. Even if politicians miraculously get their act together (don't hold your breath) the dollar is still in for trouble. In fact, it's been weak all year for reasons that have little to do with Washington, D.C. — and those issues aren't going away soon. Indeed these challenges could bring a surprise breakdown in the dollar later this year, forcing investors to make some painful portfolio adjustments, says Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. Below, I offer a five-step plan on how to position your own portfolio now, to profit from the moves others will have to make later as dollar weakens further. But first, here are the three main reasons this unexpected dollar weakness will play out. 1: A global recovery is bidding up the value of other currencies For most of the recovery since 2009, U.S. growth has outpaced foreign growth. That made the dollar more attractive. People had to buy it to get access to more favorable U.S. growth. Nowadays, though, about two thirds of foreign economies are growing faster than the U.S. Europe is a good example. ""The economy is growing well above its potential, and while full employment is still a ways off, it now seems very achievable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile, growth in China has stabilized, erasing fears about a potential meltdown there. And many emerging markets are back on track. All of this means investment dollars are flowing out of U.S. assets into foreign countries. This, of course, puts downward pressure on the dollar and drives up foreign currencies. The trend is likely to persist. Leading economic indicators suggest foreign economies will continue to do well relative to the U.S. 2: Foreign bonds are becoming more attractive For much of the recovery, U.S. government bond yields were more attractive than foreign bond yields. But now, as foreign economies strengthen, that's changing. ""For the first time in more than five years, foreign bond yields are finally becoming more competitive relative to U.S. yield offerings,"" Paulsen says. This, too, is channeling money out of the U.S. and into foreign countries, driving up their currencies relative to the dollar. 3: U.S. inflation will heat up Many pundits think the greenback will hang in there because the Fed is hiking interest rates. This will entice foreign investors to buy dollars to get access to those higher yields, according to this theory. But to really understand what is going on here and what it means for the dollar, you have to consider why the Fed is hiking rates. And that spells trouble for the dollar. The Fed is raising rates because it sees signs of higher inflation. It wants raise rates to fulfill one of its two mandates — controlling inflation. To anyone owning dollars, inflation is bad news. It means they'll have less purchasing power. So they naturally sell greenbacks. Indeed, history is replete with evidence that the dollar weakens when inflation rises. The best example: High inflation during the 1970s hammered the dollar. Don't make the mistake of being lulled by the June inflation slowdown. That was probably caused by one-off events. One was the sharp decline in cell-phone prices linked to the rising popularity of unlimited plans. Another was measurement problems related to changes in how doctors report their fees to government statisticians, Zandi says. ""The Fed continues to downplay the recent drop in core inflation,” agrees Barclays economist  Blerina Uruçi. Leuthold’s Paulsen thinks tight labor markets will soon push wage inflation above 3%, and this will boost consumer prices as people buy more stuff. ""We expect inflation anxieties to worsen in the second half of this year,"" he says. If inflation suppresses the dollar, as it normally does, matters will get worse. A weaker dollar bids up commodity prices. This leads to more inflation. And this erodes the dollar even more. Partly because of this feedback loop, a breakdown in the dollar could push wage and consumer price inflation to 3%-4%, says Paulsen, which would shock a lot of people. A key factor to watch: Any move in the dollar below its current trading range. Since early 2015, the U.S. Dollar Index

If it breaks out of that range to the downside, it will wake up a lot of investors to the potential for more dollar weakness. They'll scramble to adjust their portfolios. What to buy now: Here's what you can do now to benefit as investors make necessary changes to adapt to this new investing climate. Paulsen provided guidance on the themes below, and I've filled in suggestions on specific stocks and exchange traded funds. 1. Buy commodities: A weaker dollar pushes up commodity prices.

126,Nigam Arora,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Published: July 14, 2017 2:56 p.m. ET Retail sales and inflation reveal a weakening economy and, possibly, corporate profits By Sophisticated investors closely follow economic data. But I’ve noticed that some lesser-experienced investors don’t do the same. They should. Because two important pieces of economic data were just released. Retail sales Please click here to see a chart of retail sales. Please note from the chart that as the stock market continues to go higher, retail sales are declining after a prolonged run. This is especially troubling because the economy is near full employment. Typically, as employment gets stronger, retail sales climb. Could this be an early warning signal? The American economy is 70% based on consumer spending. For this reason, retail sales are very important. Retail sales, excluding autos, came in at -0.2% vs. +0.2% consensus month-over-month. We exclude autos from our models because they’re volatile and create noise that clouds the analysis. To see how The Arora Report filters out the noise, please click here. Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora. Inflation data The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) came at 0.1% vs. 0.2% consensus. In our models, we do not use headline CPI and exclude food and energy because they, too, are volatile. Weak inflation sometimes takes pricing power away from companies. This often leads to less profitability. Prime examples here are AT&T

Bonds and gold roar, but the dollar weakens After dovish testimony by the Federal Reserve’s Janet Yellen, weak economic data released now makes it less likely that interest rates will rise soon. The Fed is likely to focus on unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Any currency that pays a lower interest rate gets weaker. The dollar fell on the news.

Sooner or later, the music stops and someone is left standing. • From the large number of emails I have received from investors and social media, the momo crowd is driven only by price. Often such investors do not even have a good grasp of what a company does, yet they buy large quantities based on price momentum. Investors who are not especially nimble may consider staying away from this approach.

127,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"There has been a flurry of dealmaking for fiber assets, as growing demand from U.S. businesses for data transmission has fueled a revival in fiber optic services and is pushing large telecommunication companies to bulk up in fiber. No deal between WideOpenWest and Verizon is certain and negotiations could still fall apart, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Another buyer could still emerge for the asset, the sources added. WideOpenWest, which has market capitalization of around $1.4 billion and went public in May, is working with a financial adviser to explore a sale of the unit, the people said. WideOpenWest did not respond to a request for comment. Verizon declined to comment. Since 2014, WideOpenWest has built about 1,200 miles of fiber in the Chicago market for a “leading wireless carrier,” according to a corporate filing. The sources identified this carrier as Verizon. Verizon uses WideOpenWest’s fiber system in Chicago for backhaul, which is the data transfer of mobile traffic over wired lines, according to the sources. While it is under a long-term contract with the wireless carrier, WideOpenWest had said it expected it would find more business customers to use the fiber. Verizon reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst expectations on Thursday, adding 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers.. ","

128,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported quarterly revenue that topped expectations on Thursday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier attracted more subscribers with its unlimited data plan. Shares jumped 3.6 percent to $46.01 in premarket trading. In the quarter, Verizon added 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers, compared to an increase of 615,000 in the year-earlier period. The additions were higher than the JPMorgan estimate of 115,000 and consensus expectations of 70,000, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note on Thursday. Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones. In February, Verizon reintroduced an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years. Since then, other carriers have launched aggressive promotions. Sprint said in June that it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. The company added 358,000 phone-only subscribers, compared with 86,000 net additions a year ago. Verizon’s unlimited plan, priced at $80 a month for a single line, is more expensive than competing plans. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said Thursday’s post-earnings conference call that “even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver.” Churn, or the rate of customer defections for subscribers paying a monthly bill, was flat at 0.94 percent from the year-earlier period, and lower than analysts’ estimates of 1.1 percent, according to JPMorgan. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, called the subscriber numbers “very strong,” but added that “we remain cautious on Verizon equity given what we regard as unsustainable margins and returns in a competitive market.” Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.36 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter, from $702 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 96 cents per share. Total operating revenue edged up to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $29.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The latest quarter included a gain from the sale of data centers and lower expenses. Earnings in the year-earlier period were also hurt by a strike in the wireline business. ","

AT&T said it lost 89,000 U.S. phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the quarter, its most lucrative customers. Analysts had expected a far bigger loss of 256,000. The company’s better-than-expected subscriber metrics and margin performance alleviated some concerns that hang over the stock, Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski wrote in a note on Wednesday. “In Wireless, it now seems clear that we will see record low churn for the industry this quarter, with consumers likely waiting for the new iPhone before switching and upgrading,” wrote New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin on Wednesday. It bought Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85.4 billion to bundle mobile service with entertainment. AT&T expects that deal to close by year-end. AT&T announced in April it was offering its unlimited wireless plan with its streaming service DirecTV Now for an additional $10 a month. Product bundles will help win new subscribers and keep existing ones, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. AT&T reported second-quarter earnings of 79 cents per share, excluding certain items, topping analysts’ average estimate of 73 cents per share. Longer term, the Dallas-based company’s share appreciation will depend on performance after its acquisition of Time Warner, Barclays said.

132, ,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Yahoo started as a pioneer and wound up a mere holding company. Uber Technologies could be embarking on the same path. In the heady days of 1999, Yahoo’s market value soared beyond $100 billion. Last month, the company offloaded the last vestiges of its online business to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion. What’s left under the rebranded $56 billion Altaba is stakes acquired long ago in Jack Ma’s Chinese e-commerce goliath Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, along with about $11 billion of net cash. Meanwhile, legal and regulatory roadblocks keep piling up for Uber on top of a workplace-culture fiasco that has left the company, last valued at some $68 billion, without its co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, among other senior-level gaps. As it struggles to preserve its app-driven ride service and build fledgling logistics and autonomous-vehicle businesses, Uber has begun rounding up positions in some promising far-flung markets, too. It parlayed a cash-burning Chinese operation into a roughly 18 percent stake in rival Didi Chuxing last year. That stake alone is worth around $8 billion based on a recent $5.5 billion Didi fundraising that valued the whole company at $50 billion. Earlier this month, Uber did something similar in Russia, abandoning cutthroat competition with local rival Yandex in favor of 37 percent ownership in a new combined service, a stake initially valued at well over $1 billion. The two interests add up to approaching $10 billion. Meanwhile, Uber’s overall worth is declining. On the secondary market, it dipped to $50 billion in June, according to TechCrunch. It wouldn’t be surprising if it’s still falling following Kalanick’s ouster. A new fundraising in April for Lyft, Uber’s primary U.S. rival, pegged its value at $7.5 billion. Suppose Uber’s larger American business is worth twice that, and its China and Russia stakes soon appreciate by 50 percent. Ignoring Uber’s efforts in other countries, some of which eventually could become additional stakes, it would add up to a $30 billion company, with half the value already accounted for by minority interests. Extrapolate a few more years, and it’s not hard to see Uber becoming the next Altaba. Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

134, ,7272017,Reuters,7202017,［ニューヨーク　２０日　ロイター　BREAKINGVIEWS］ - 米ネット検索大手だったヤフーは、先駆者として登場したが、最終的にはただの持ち株会社に落ち着いた。米配車サービス大手ウーバー・テクノロジーズ[UBER.UL]もその道をたどり始めたかにみえる。 一方のウーバーは、法律や規制面での障害が次々と現れ、さらには職場のセクハラ問題などの不祥事を受けて共同創業者であるトラビス・カラニック氏が最高経営責任者（ＣＥＯ）を辞任し、他の幹部ポストにも空きが出る状態になっている。同社の直近の評価額は６８０億ドルだった。 アプリを使った配車サービスを維持し、ロジスティックスや自動運転車など新分野のビジネスを築こうと苦心する一方で、ウーバーは、遠く離れた一部の有望市場での事業を整理している。 ウーバーは昨年、大きな赤字だった中国事業を現地の配車サービス最大手「滴滴出行」に譲渡し、合併後の新会社株式の約１８％を取得した。滴滴出行が最近、評価額を５００億ドルとして５５億ドルの資金調達を行ったことを踏まえれば、この株の持ち分だけで約８０億ドルの価値がある。 しかしその間、ウーバー全体の企業価値は減少している。ニュースサイトのテッククランチによると、流通市場では６月に時価総額が５００億ドルに下落した。カラニック氏の辞任を受けて、さらに下落していても不思議ではない。 ウーバーの米国最大の競合相手であるリフトが４月に行った資金調達では、リフトの評価額は７５億ドルだった。ウーバーの米国事業がその倍の規模で、中国とロシアで保有する株式の価値が間もなく５０％上昇すると仮定しよう。ウーバーが他の国で展開している事業は、いずれ他社株式に転換されるものもあるかもしれないが、ここでは無視する。そうすると、全てを足し合わせた評価額は３００億ドルとなる。その半分はすでに他社株式の持ち分だ。これを元に数年後を予想すれば、ウーバーが次のアルタバになることは、想像に難くない。 ＊筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。 ＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。 ,"

The super-thin device touts a shatterproof display, thinner battery and a 360 Camera Moto Mod, a two-sided, circular camera which juts out at the top of the phone like a small periscope. (See also: Is Motorola a Great Stock for Value Investors?) Motorola has debuted a similar type of design to the Z2 with the release of the Moto Z Force and Droid Turbo 2. Like other phones in the Moto Z line, the new Z2 model has a set of connectors on its back that allows the phone to connect to Motorola’s various Moto Mod modular accessories, including wireless chargers or game controllers. A new Moto Mod 360-degree camera will cost a whopping $300. While the phone is not officially water resistant, but Motorola says it will have a level of “water protection” that allows it to survive light rain. While last year’s Moto Z Force was available only on Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ) network, the new Z2 version will sell for all the major carriers in the U.S. beginning Aug. 10. Price will vary by carrier, at around $750. While the wider availability will help expand Motorola’s market reach, competition is still fierce as smart device makers including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Samsung Electronics and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) plan to release new products in the upcoming months. Last month, Motorola shares jumped on news of the anticipated product release and word that the company was on track to sell 3 million Moto Z devices within the line’s first year on the market.

136,Liz Moyer,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"Comcast Corp. should buy Verizon Communications, a deal that could be worth $215 billion, an analyst from Citigroup said Wednesday. Though many view Verizon as a likely suitor for Dish Network, the analyst said Comcast could swoop in with a deal for the wireless carrier that would help it extend internet connectivity outside the home. The analyst estimates Comcast could pay a 20 percent premium to Verizon's share price, which was $43.98 at the close of trading Tuesday. Verizon's shares are down more than 17 percent this year, so much so that Comcast, the parent of NBCUniversal, is now bigger in terms of market value, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Verizon's market value was $179 billion as of Tuesday's close, so a 20 percent premium would put a deal value at $215 billion. ""It's a call Comcast should make ... and Verizon should take,"" wrote Bazinet in the note. Verizon shares were up more than 1 percent in morning trading, while Comcast shares were flat. The research cites press reports that indicate Verizon could be open to a deal with Disney, CBS or Comcast. A spokesman from Comcast and a spokeswoman for Verizon both declined to comment. It is a time of rapid consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries. Companies that create content are looking for more efficient ways to distribute it at a time when many households are moving to streaming services from Netflix and Amazon.com. Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2009 and attempted a deal with Time Warner Cable in 2014, but called it off the next year. Telecom giant AT&T and media giant Time Warner are waiting on regulatory approval for their $80 billion combination, which would marry video content with delivery on mobile devices. Bazinet said in his note that the regulatory climate may be more amenable under the current administration to big combinations. A Comcast-Verizon tie-up could boost revenue at the combined company, he said. He estimates Comcast would have to sell about 16 percent of its cable operations where it overlaps with Verizon's FiOS network.

Shares of  Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) popped on Thursday morning, trading 6.5% higher as of 11:15 a.m. EDT. The fuel for this fire came from Verizon's second-quarter earnings report, which it posted before the opening bell. Verizon's revenue held flat year over year at $35.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose from $0.94 to $0.96. The bottom-line result landed right where with Wall Street had expected it to, but the sales result was a modestly positive surprise. More importantly, Verizon added 590,000 net new subscribers in the all-important postpaid smartphones category. Retail postpaid phone churn landed below 0.9% per month for the ninth consecutive quarter, setting an all-time low in the LTE era at 0.7%. Low churn equals loyal customers, so that's great news for Verizon and its investors. Image source: Getty Images. This rosy report put a decisive stop to Verizon's recent share price slide, but the stock is still trading roughly 12% lower year to date. Management gave credit for these solid results to the February launch of all-new unlimited wireless data plans. Looking ahead, Verizon simply reaffirmed its view that full-year results in 2017 should stay close to the figures posted in 2016 on both the top and bottom lines. All things considered, Big Red earned this reprieve from share price pressures and today's market reaction makes perfect sense.

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has once again swept the twice-yearly RootMetrics Mobile Performance in the United States report on a national level. The company did tie with Sprint (NYSE:S) and AT&T (NYSE:T) in the ""text"" category, but the company lost ground at the metro level in the study that covers the first half of 2017. ""The bigger story exists at state and metro levels where AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile [(NASDAQ:TMUS)] make significant strides,"" according to an emailed statement from RootMetrics. ""Metro-level performance provides the strongest gauge of a network for consumers."" Since many people don't travel extensively, or travel within limited areas, or travel only a few times year, the most important thing is how their wireless network works wherever they spend the most time. Gains are being made by its rivals, but Verizon still has the top wireless network. Image source Getty Images. RootMetrics defines metro areas as not just city centers, but also residential suburbs, business districts, recreational areas, and the highways that connect them. It tests network performance in all those areas and while Verizon still won, it scored fewer first place wins than in the previous period while AT&T, and to a much-lesser extent, T-Mobile scored more. First-place awards are only part of the story as RootMetrics noted that ""AT&T and T-Mobile made big speed and reliability improvements in metro areas."" Even Sprint, which appears to be the least successful carrier in the current report, saw ""significantly boosted data speeds and reliability at the metro level,"" according to the independent research firm. To come up with its score, RootMetrics testers drove over ""275,000 miles while testing performance on highways and in big cities, small towns, and rural areas across the U.S."" In total the company collected approximately ""4.7 million test samples while driving and at more than 8,800 indoor locations."" It's worth noting that while Verizon has run television commercials based on RootMetrics' results, T-Mobile CEO John Legere considers them biased. He sent an email to the media in February 2016 about the research company turning off his company's Voice over LTE feature, ""that is on every single phone we sell. VoLTE handles roughly 50% of calls made on the T-Mobile network,"" he wrote. Legere also questioned exactly how independent the research firm is, asking ""Do we have to pay RootMetrics millions like the other carriers do to get them to stop deliberately turning off significant portions of our network and skewing results during their drive tests? Coincidence? Doubt it."" RootMetrics said in an email to The Motley Fool responding to Legere's complaint that anyone can purchase its highly detailed data, but that is not connected to its results. RootMetrics now tests VoLTE and has since the first half of 2016. Verizon can still accurately say it has the best network, but that claim no longer means as much as it once did. Wireless network reliability overall has improved and that has given the public more viable choices. For many people, AT&T, T-Mobile, and even Sprint offer a good, or at least good enough, experience. Verizon is the leader with AT&T the clear No. 2, but for a lot of people, T-Mobile and Sprint have improved to the point where they are reasonable options, especially since they are the cheapest of the four major carriers.

    Verizon Has the Best Wireless Network, but That's Not the Whole Story -- The Motley Fool

140,Adam Levy,7272017,Fool,7202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The second quarter was Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) first full quarter following the release of its unlimited plan. Prior to offering unlimited data, Verizon was bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and other competing wireless carriers. And while it might still be bleeding subscribers, the unlimited plan is certainly helping stem the losses. But a recent survey from Cowen and Company, found Verizon is the largest donor of subscribers to other carriers. Cowen determined Verizon's late entry to unlimited plans cost it a lot of subscribers. But one number from T-Mobile's earnings report indicates Verizon is starting to turn things around. Image source: Verizon T-Mobile reports its porting ratios with the other major carriers just about every quarter. The porting ratio is a good indicator of how many customers switch from one carrier to T-Mobile. A number over one indicates T-Mobile is winning more customers than its losing from that carrier. T-Mobile has reported porting ratios above 1 with every major wireless competitor for three years straight. But last quarter, T-Mobile's porting ratio with Verizon fell to 1.2. That's the lowest level it's seen in years. Even when Verizon was incentivizing subscribers to port their number, it didn't see a porting ratio so low with T-Mobile. Here's how it compares to AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) as well as prior periods. Q2 2017 Q1 2017 Q2 2016 Verizon 1.2 1.7 1.4 AT&T 1.6 2.3 1.6 Sprint 1.3 1.6 1.2 Data source: T-Mobile quarterly earnings calls As you can see, all three carriers made improvements against T-Mobile compared to the first quarter, but compared to the same period a year ago, Verizon was the only carrier that saw improved results. That's despite Sprint's efforts to attract subscribers with free service for a year and AT&T's unlimited bundles including discounts for its TV services and HBO. It's important to note that T-Mobile is just one of Verizon's big competitors. To wit, the trend in porting ratios is only an indicator of improving results at Verizon versus all of its competitors. But considering T-Mobile is the only carrier exhibiting significant postpaid subscriber growth, it's a pretty good indicator. Things are looking better for Verizon. Cowen and Company's survey shows a long-term view of the past. Verizon has donated more customers to other carriers over the last two years. That said, Verizon has more retail customers to donate than any other carrier, so it would only make sense that it loses the most customers. Additionally, Cowen's report doesn't look at trend lines. It's important to remember to invest based on expectations for the future, not what's happened in the past. Comments from T-Mobile's management indicate Verizon is doing a better job of holding onto its subscribers than it has in the past. There are a couple of factors that show up in the cost of Verizon's new unlimited plan. While it's helped the company retain subscribers, its average revenue per user is declining. That's because the first customers to switch to unlimited are those that can save money since they're regularly hit with overage charges from using tons of data. That said, Verizon expects the downward trend in ARPU to subside in the second half of the year, as more customers move up the chain to the unlimited plan and opt to spend more. The second area where Verizon is experiencing costs is in its network. T-Mobile just released data from Ookla showing Verizon's network speeds have declined significantly since it started offering its unlimited data plan. Its peak network speeds fell below AT&T's. While T-Mobile only reported peak speeds, and may not give the full picture of network coverage and average speed, the report is nonetheless a bad indicator for Verizon. Verizon's branding is all about the quality of its network. If its unlimited data plan cuts into the quality of its network to a noticeable degree, it may not be able continue retaining subscribers at its current rate. That said, Verizon has a lot of cash and more coming in every quarter to invest in its network. ","
      
    T-Mobile's Earnings Report Had Some Good News For Verizon Investors -- The Motley Fool

In one corner stands Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), heavyweight champ of the U.S. wireless industry with 114 million subscribers. In the other is AT&T (NYSE:T), the No. 2 ranked competitor and current challenger for Verizon's title belt. Together, these telecom giants control about two-thirds of the U.S. wireless market. They both generate robust profits and pay bountiful dividends of more than 5%. But in the battle for investors' dollars, which of these wireless titans will emerge victorious and be named the better buy today? Read on to find out. We pit AT&T against Verizon in this better buy battle. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to telecoms, competitive advantage is often determined by the strength of a company's wireless network. And while evidence suggests that the difference in network quality among the major U.S. wireless carriers is shrinking, Verizon still holds an edge over AT&T in this regard. AT&T, however, isn't just standing still. The company is competing not only on the performance of its wireless network, but also on the total value it can provide to consumers. Thanks to its $49 billion acquisition of DIRECTV in 2015, AT&T can offer its customers a bundled package of services including wireless, home phone, internet, and pay TV. In this way, AT&T is hoping that its customers see this bundle as an even greater value than the sum of its parts. And based on some customer loyalty surveys, it appears to be working. Still, Verizon's reputation for superior network quality is a valuable competitive advantage, and it gives it a slight edge over AT&T in terms of economic moat. Round 1 winner: Verizon Investors typically look to the telecom sector for two things above else: capital preservation and income generation. As such, a telecom's financial fortitude is of the upmost importance. Let's take a look at how Verizon and AT&T stack up in this regard. Metric Verizon AT&T Revenue $123.6 billion $162.6 billion EBITDA $39.7 billion $49.6 billion Net income $12.3 billion $12.6 million Free cash flow ($0.4 billion) $16.9 billion Cash $4.3 billion $14.9 billion Debt $116.5 billion $133.2 billion Data source: Morningstar. Round 2 winner: AT&T No better buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's check out some key value metrics for Verizon and AT&T, including forward and trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Metric Verizon AT&T Trailing P/E ratio 14.71 17.74 Forward P/E ratio 11.58 12.29 PEG ratio 4.77 1.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Verizon seems like the better bargain until you look at the PEG -- or price-to-earnings-to-growth -- ratio, which in my opinion is the most important out of these three metrics. The sizable variance in Verizon's and AT&T's PEG ratios is due to the fact that analysts are expecting AT&T to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 7% over the next five years, compared to only 2.5% for Verizon. With their forward P/E ratios being pretty close, this large difference in expected growth rates results in Verizon's PEG coming in at more than 2.5 times that of AT&T. Investors' returns from this point forward will be determined by these companies' future profits -- as opposed to their trailing earnings -- so AT&T's sharply lower PEG makes it the better bargain. Round 3 winner: AT&T AT&T, in a surprise upset, takes down Verizon in this heavyweight bout. Verizon's network quality lead isn't quite what it once was, and AT&T's superior cash flow generation and better valuation outmatch anything Verizon beings into the ring. For investors seeking a high-yield stock in the telecom sector, AT&T is the better buy. ","

Brutal doesn't begin to describe the past year for Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) shareholders. Nothing has gone right, and the market has noticed, giving Frontier one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market today. Things are so bad, in fact, that the stock has declined by an astounding 82.2% over the past year, against a 25.5% gain in the Nasdaq Composite over the same period. FTR data by YCharts So what caused this sell-off, and are further share-price declines in store? Let's examine each question. Over the past several years, Frontier has doubled down on legacy telecom services, hoping that economies of scale by way of consolidation could help buoy its performance, even as wireless standards continue to grow in popularity. In pursuit of its goal, Frontier closed a bet-the-farm acquisition of Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) legacy product customers in California, Florida, and Texas. In exchange for $10.5 billion in cash paid to Verizon, Frontier received ""3.7 million voice connections, 2.2 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video connections,"" according to the merger's February 2015 press release. The company funded that deal through a mix of debt and equity financing, but the former is particularly important, considering Frontier's current predicament. Over the years, Frontier has engaged in a series of roll-up acquisitions that helped make it one of the largest U.S. providers of legacy telecom services. Along the way, Frontier also amassed over $17 billion in debt, which lead to its current state of crisis. The company's soaring debt load has also given rise to concerns that the company may not be able to meet its interest payments. The first major repayment date is still several years off, when Frontier will need to repay $2.4 billion in principal in 2020. However, the company generated only $2.0 billion in cash from operations over the past 12 months, and that doesn't include necessary expenditures such as maintaining its network. Worse yet, the discouraging customer attrition metrics imply that Frontier will be unable to grow its cash flows as consumers continue to move away from traditional phone services in favor of wireless. Image source: Getty Images. Companies facing looming debt repayments can typically refinance those debts, pushing out their due dates. However, Frontier may not be able to secure such financing if its business metrics don't improve, which is why the company recently enacted a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at bolstering its financial profile. As part of its Q1 earnings announcement, Frontier disclosed plans to reduce its dividend by just over 60%, from $0.105 per share to $0.04, effective immediately. Management said the plan should help Frontier save $300 million annually, and it believes it can increase those savings to a run rate of $400 million annually by the end of 2018. This move will allow the company to pay down debt, with the goal of lowering Frontier's leverage ratio from 4.39 to 4.0 by the end of 2019, and eventually reaching 3.5 by the end of 2021. Assuming the company can implement the program, it should go a long way toward helping Frontier reduce its debt burden, from one that could be disastrous to one that's big but maybe not fatal. However, customer retention will also play a significant role in determining whether Frontier survives this dark chapter in its history. Here, the jury is out. Frontier claims it has weathered the worst of its subscriber churn crisis, but the company's growth strategy is predicated on further building out its fiber broadband network at the same time national telecom powers such as Verizon and AT&T  hope to bring more of their services over cellular networks. Investors should, therefore, think long and hard before trying to buy into Frontier as a contrarian turnaround investment. ","

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported second-quarter results on July 19. The No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier delivered strong revenue and profit growth fueled by what are likely to be industry-leading customer gains. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $10.213 billion $9.287 billion 10% Net income $581 million $225 million 158% Earnings per share $0.67 $0.25 168% Data source: T-Mobile Q2 2017 earnings release (opens PDF). T-Mobile added 1.3 million net new customers, bringing its total subscriber count to 69.6 million and extending its streak of adding more than 1 million customers to 17 consecutive quarters. T-Mobile added 817,000 total postpaid subscribers -- who pay monthly bills and are typically the most sought-after customers for wireless carriers -- during the second quarter, including 786,000 net postpaid phone customers. T-Mobile expects these figures to lead the industry for the sixth consecutive quarter -- a notable accomplishment considering that industry leader Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) finally succumbed to the pressure of customer losses and began offering unlimited data plans earlier this year. Yet while Verizon may have slowed its subscriber defections, it didn't stop them, and now it appears that it also didn't halt T-Mobile's market-share gains. T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image Source: T-Mobile. CEO John Legere, who once again pulled no punches in his press-release statement, said that T-Mobile also gained the upper hand in network speeds after Verizon and fellow industry titan AT&T (NYSE:T) moved to match T-Mobile's unlimited data offerings. ""Our network just keeps getting better and faster while the Duopoly's networks seem to be choking after we forced them to go unlimited,"" Legere said. ""Make no mistake about it, the Un-carrier will not stop forcing change in this industry and our Q2 results are more proof that consumers are responding!"" To Legere's point, consumers do seem to be responding favorably to T-Mobile's offerings, as evidenced by both its industry-leading new-subscriber additions and its record low postpaid phone churn -- or customer defections -- which fell to 1.10%, down 17 basis points compared to the prior-year period. In all, T-Mobile's strong customer retention and subscriber growth fueled a 10% year-over-year increase in total revenue, to $10.2 billion. In turn, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring items -- jumped 19%, to $3 billion. Adjusted net income surged 158%, to $581 million, or $0.67 per share. These results prompted T-Mobile to boost its full-year subscriber-growth forecast to a range of 3.0 million to 3.6 million branded postpaid net additions, up from previous estimates of 2.8 million to 3.5 million. The company also raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion from $10.4 billion to $10.8 billion. Peering out even further into the future, T-Mobile remains confident in its ability to grow its operating and free cash flow at annualized rates of 15% to 18% and 45% to 48%, respectively, from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019. Legere also made some predictions during T-Mobile's earnings conference call: I predict that T-Mobile will be the only provider to grow total wireless revenues by double digits year-over-year. I predict that we'll be the only carrier to grow wireless service revenues at all year-over-year. And I predict that we will take all of the industry's postpaid phone growth again, at the same time achieving record profitability and strong free cash flow growth. While these are bold statements, T-Mobile has a history of delivering on Legere's promises. ","
      
    T-Mobile US Earnings Surge on 1.3 Million Subscriber Additions -- The Motley Fool

144,Daniel B. Kline,7272017,Fool,7202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) bet $10.54 billion that bigger would prove to be better and that proved to be a mistake. The company spent that money buying approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) from Verizon (NYSE:VZ). That deal was supposed to give the company the scale to lower its costs, while also making it more competitive with its much-larger rivals. ""This is a transformative acquisition for Frontier that delivers first-rate assets and important new opportunities given our dramatically expanded scale,"" said CEO Daniel J. McCarthy in April 2016 when the deal closed. ""It significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" That's true, but paying $10.54 billion for subscribers you slowly lose, does not count as a good deal. Frontier has achieved over $1.25 billion in annual cost savings with another $350 million to come, but it's still losing money and its subscriber counts have fallen in all four quarters since the deal closed. Frontier has been losing subscribers and there's no reason to believe that will change. Image source: Getty Images. In recent months Frontier has slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.105 to $0.04. It did that at roughly the same time it completed a 15-1 reverse stock split. That was a needed move to avoid being delisted, but those two moves together dramatically weakened any reason investors had to hold onto their shares. McCarthy and the Frontier board of directors made the move not only to avoid delisting, but also to preserve cash. ""As you have seen, we have reduced our quarterly dividend to $0.04 per share, which will make available approximately $300 million of additional cash annually, increasing to $400 million annually in the second half of 2018,"" the CEO said. ""We'll use this to reduce debt at a faster rate, and we are now targeting a leverage ratio of 3.5 times over the next few years."" Those moves are needed because the company followed up a $133 million loss in Q4 2016 by losing $129 million in Q1 2017. McCarthy has proven to be very good at manipulating money and pushing out loan obligations to buy runway, but that won't solve the company's biggest problem, subscriber loss. As noted above Frontier has lost subscribers in every quarter it has owned the former Verizon properties. McCarthy first blamed that on problems related to the transition, then cited a lack of marketing, before most-recently saying that people not paying their bills caused a one-time drop. Whatever the reason the company lost 144,000 residential customers and 14,000 business subscribers in Q4. It then followed that by dropping another 155,000 residential customers and 18,000 business subscribers in Q1. Those losses can't be explained by cord cutting since the company has not followed the broad industry trend in losing pay-TV subscribers, it has also been losing broadband users. While McCarthy has excuses for the subscriber drop, the reality is that Frontier has lost the one edge it used to have. As a secondary provider in all its markets competing with much bigger companies, Frontier could lure people to its service with lower prices. It still uses that tactic, but it's no longer the only game in town. There are a variety of skinny digital streaming pay-TV packages that are cheaper than Frontier and the company also has to deal with consumers willing to cut the cord in favor of non-live TV services like Hulu or Netflix. Those trends are only going to accelerate with even big cable being more willing to offer more a la carte options or lower-cost bundles. That makes it very unlikely the company will reverse its subscriber trends, which will cause its losses to grow, eventually putting it in a hole too deep to climb out of no matter how clever McCarthy manages resources.

    Here's Why the Worst Is Yet to Come for Frontier Communications Corporation -- The Motley Fool

  ",-0.9973
145,Anders Bylund,7272017,Fool,7202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) fell 28% in 2016 and another 66% in the first half of 2017. The regional telecom's financial results have been a mixed bag lately, and Frontier recently slashed its dividend payments by 62%. Are shares a buy after these adjustments, or should investors still stay away from Frontier Communications stock? Let's start with a quick dividend analysis, because Frontier has been an income investor's best friend for many years. The stock's lowest yield in the last 10 years was a still-generous 4.9% in the spring of 2015, and Frontier's yields raced higher than 20% as share prices plunged in early 2017. That's where Frontier's management took action. Dividend Pay Date Payout Per Share (split-adjusted) Total Dividend Cost Cash Payout Ratio June 30, 2015 $1.575 $106 million 53% Sept. 30, 2015 $1.575 $189 million 83% Dec. 31, 2015 $1.575 $176 million 72% March 31, 2016 $1.575 $177 million 95% June 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 70% Sept. 30, 2016 $1.575 $178 million 106% Dec. 30, 2016 $1.575 $176 million 101% March 31, 2017 $1.575 $178 million 56% June 30, 2017 $0.60 $68 million (estimated) 28% (estimated) Data sources: Dividend.com and Frontier Communications. After holding steady at $1.575 per split-adjusted share for more than two years, Frontier's quarterly dividend was lowered to $0.60 per share in an announcement on May 2, 2017. At the same time, the company also approved a previously announced 15-for-1 reverse share split and reported disappointing first-quarter results. Share prices fell 22% over the next couple of days as investors digested the one-two punch of lower payouts and continued customer losses. Frontier CEO Dan McCarthy explained that the dividend needed to slow down in order to give Frontier more financial flexibility. ""As we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver on the full potential of our strong assets and generate additional cash flow, we will optimize our capital allocation to ensure we strike a balance between investing in the business, paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders,"" he said. So Frontier's dividend is down, and the company's cash flows have been earmarked for debt repayments rather than payout increases. Frontier's effective dividend yield remains generous due to sliding share prices, but you shouldn't expect any dividend payment boosts out of the company's management anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. McCarthy talks a good game, and promises to have his company back on solid financial ground soon enough. But Frontier often falls short of its own guidance targets and management needs to be held to its promises here. This is not made easier by the fact that Frontier is having trouble providing acceptable levels of service to its new customers in Florida, California, and Texas -- the three large markets the company acquired in a $10.5 billion deal with Verizon Communications in 2016. So I would take Dan McCarthy's rosy debt reduction talk with a grain of salt. That doesn't make dividend increases any more likely, either. In fact, it's probably a good idea to stay away from Frontier Communications stock altogether. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    Is Frontier Communications Stock a Buy? -- The Motley Fool

146,Tyler Crowe,7272017,Fool,7202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the market hitting the highs it has lately, any company that is selling for any kind of discount these days should probably be viewed with a certain bit of skepticism. After all, if there is so much confidence in the overall market, then something has to be deeply flawed with these companies. As is always the case with Wall Street, many of the things that dictate share price have to do with very short timelines that may not necessarily apply to an individual looking to buy and hold a stock for several years, especially when it comes to dividend stocks. Three stocks that look incredibly cheap today that may not necessarily merit such a deep discount are Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and 8point3 Energy Partners (NASDAQ:CAFD). Here's why these high-yield stocks may be worth a spot in your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. There's no denying that coal is on its way out as an economically viable energy source. According to Lazard's levelized cost of energy study, coal is now behind natural gas, solar, and wind on a cost-per-megawatt-hour basis -- and that doesn't include the impacts of subsidies or carbon taxes. Any company looking to invest in new power-producing facilities probably isn't going to look at coal as a viable option. Just look at the scheduled capacity additions in the U.S. for 2016-2020: Though net capacity additions will total 76 gigawatts, coal's net capacity will decline by 16 gigawatts, while other power sources offset these declines. This doesn't paint a pretty picture for any coal investments, but Alliance Resource Partners is probably the one exception. The company's mines in the Illinois Basin are the lowest cost-coal source out there when you consider all the factors, such as transportation. What this means is that Alliance's coal production has an opportunity to grow, while other mine regions, such as Appalachia and the Powder River Basin, suffer even larger declines. Also, when you consider that coal is still the largest source of electric power in the U.S., there is still some time left to make money in coal. And what better way to make money in this dying industry than with a company that has an 8.5% distribution yield and a balance sheet that won't blow up in a couple of years? Alliance's low-cost coal production, its low leverage, and a management team that isn't investing a lot in new mines is the strategy you want for an investment in coal today. Even with these desirable traits, Alliance's stock has an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio of just 2.4. That's the kind of valuation you give to a company that is on the brink of collapse. Alliance probably won't be around forever, but its stock doesn't merit a valuation that low. If you want a stock that will throw off gobs of cash over the next several years, Alliance is the company for you. We've seen this before in the telecommunications business. Wireless providers start to reach network parity as a certain technology matures, and it sparks a bit of a price war as the non-price factors diminish. This is where we are at right now when it comes to Verizon Communications. Its competitors have had time to invest in 4G network infrastructure such that the difference between networks is much smaller than when 4G first came out. So to keep customers, wireless providers have turned to offering lower-cost contracts and bringing back unlimited data plans. As a result, competitors like T-Mobile are taking market share. Here's the thing, though: We're on the cusp of wireless providers' starting to roll out 5G networks. Verizon said that it plans to roll out 5G service in 11 markets by the middle of this year. That may be just a baby step, but the $3.1 billion for Straight Path back in May gives the company loads of across-the-country spectrum that covers the 40 largest markets. Now that Verizon has the technology and the spectrum, the next thing it will need in order to deploy 5G is loads of cash flow for investing. That is one place where Verizon excels. The company's subscriber base is the largest in the nation and should provide it with the most cash to throw at deploying 5G. If it can beat all its competitors to market with a 5G network, don't be surprised if all that pricing competition falls to the wayside. When you consider this dynamic, Verizon's stock looks awfully cheap. It currently carries a dividend yield of 5.3%, and its enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 6.8 times is more than reasonable. When 8point3 Energy Partners IPOed a couple years ago, it looked like a solar yield company that made much more sense than others in the market. Having two parent organizations -- solar panel manufacturers Sunpower and First Solar -- gave some reassurance that it wouldn't get projects rammed down its throat by a single parent org just looking to grow the payout at the expense of everything else. Recently, though, both Sunpower and First Solar have announced that they are looking to sell their stakes in 8point3. Both companies seem to think that there are enough buyers out there for projects that they don't need to be involved in the development phase anymore and can focus on the manufacturing end. That may sound like a death sentence for 8point3. If it doesn't have a parent organization, then how will it be able to buy development projects? If that is the concern on Wall Street (and it appears so, as shares have a price-to-tangible-book ratio of just 1.6 times and a dividend yield of 7.2%), then it seems a bit shortsighted. One thing to consider is that it still has right of first offer on 301 megawatts of power-generating assets held by the two parent companies. If 8point3 buys all of these facilities, that's a 31% increase to the portfolio today. Also, if both parent orgs decide to cut ties, then there is nothing stopping 8point3 from buying a stake in other solar power facilities as a third-party financier. I'll admit that 8point3's accounting looks fuzzy. A lot of cash comes from minority and unconsolidated interests in projects that don't show up in revenue or earnings. However, if the reason so many people are shying away from the stock is that Sunpower and First Solar want out, then this is a steal. ","

Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) core business is thriving, with strong engagement for the company's namesake social network and its Instagram subsidiary driving impressive top- and bottom-line growth. Here's a look at how the momentum from the company's social networks translated to earnings performance last quarter: Data source: Facebook. With Facebook having since passed 2 billion monthly active users and management indicating that ad placement on the social network is near a saturation point, growth could be more difficult to deliver going forward, but the company is hardly resting on its laurels. The leader in social networking is working on initiatives that have the potential to create huge benefits for its core products and open up new business avenues down the line. Image source: Facebook. From the invention of the television through the rise of the mobile phone, the screen has been at the center of the information age, but dramatic changes for display technology could be on the horizon. Virtual reality (VR) got its first big commercial push in 2016 and currently has niche appeal, but Facebook is betting on the technology's potential and angling to play a leading role in bringing it to the mainstream. The social media giant's virtual reality push is probably the company's most well-known innovation investment, with its $3 billion acquisition of VR company Oculus generating lots of press and evidencing a clear enthusiasm for display innovation. Facebook's Oculus Rift headset has gotten off to a somewhat disappointing start, with the device receiving a number of price cuts following weaker-than-expected sales and trailing HTC's competing Vive hardware, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reiterated a belief in VR as the next big computing platform and has his company working on a range of hardware and content initiatives that could lay foundations for the future of the tech. Facebook Spaces; Image source: Facebook. The company recently launched Facebook Spaces, a platform that allows users to create an avatar to hangout and share pictures and video in virtual chat rooms. It also recently partnered with Samsung for the release of the Facebook 360 app, bringing the social network's panoramic photo and video content to the Gear VR platform. In 2016, Facebook committed a $250 million investment in VR content, and Zuckerberg has indicated that his company plans to invest an additional $3 billion over the next decade to improve VR and drive adoption. The company also has plans to develop augmented reality (AR) offerings far beyond the filters currently available on Instagram, stating in its most recent earnings call that it plans to invest aggressively in content and infrastructure to build its position in AR. These technologies have the potential to change the way the world sees and interacts with information, and, if they take off, they'll open up innovations opportunities in industries ranging from retail to healthcare. Image source: Internet.org. Facebook is working to bring free (or at least low-cost) internet to the world, a move that will dramatically expand its addressable market -- and one that could threaten internet service providers (ISPs) and wireless carriers. The company recently launched Express Wi-Fi, a partnership project with a group of ISPs in Africa and Asia to expand the reach of connectivity, and it's got even more ambitious plans in the works. Here's a Zuckerberg quote from Facebook's most recent earnings call about the progress the company is making with its internet-beaming airplane project: On the connectivity side, in April we successfully simultaneously beamed 16 gigabits of data in each direction between a location on the ground and a Cessna aircraft circling more than 7 km away. Eventually, we're going to use this technology along with Aquila, our solar-powered plane we're building, to beam internet to parts of the world that currently don't have access. The company is also working on delivering internet by satellite. Of the roughly 7.5 billion people on Earth, roughly 3.7 billion are currently connected to the internet, so expanding the reach of network connectivity presents Facebook with huge growth opportunities. Building its position in the telecommunications field gives Facebook ways to sidestep data cap and throttling issues the company faces from international ISPs as well as domestic providers including Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast -- issues that could become more pronounced as the social network makes streaming video content a bigger part of its platform. For now, Facebook's efforts are concentrated on making the internet more globally accessible, but, in the long term, growing its provider capabilities could make it significantly less dependent on today's telecom leaders. Image source: Facebook. Facebook is also aiming to shakeup the network hardware space, and has been distributing designs for ""white box"" alternatives and partnering with manufactures to make them available for enterprise. These are made with non-proprietary parts and run on open-source software, and pose a significant threat to networking companies including Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks because they offer levels of flexibility and customization beyond products from the current industry leaders. They also have the potential to dramatically reduce pricing power for routing, switching, and data center. Increases in video streaming and the use of VR and AR technologies will put added pressure on data centers and increase costs for businesses. Facebook has an interest in facilitating these technologies, and reducing the expenses associated with networking hardware has the potential to remove a central roadblock to their progression. Lowering the costs of network infrastructure is also likely to play a big role in bringing internet connectivity to areas that are currently without it, so it's a disruptive initiative that could have huge payoff and pave the way for the evolution of the social network.

    Beyond the Social Network: Facebook Wants to Disrupt These 3 Industries -- The Motley Fool

148,,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"After posting surprising losses among cellphone subscribers earlier this year, Verizon is back. The wireless carrier said Thursday that it has added 358,000 phone subscribers over the past several months, blowing analyst expectations out of the water and showing that its unlimited data plans are helping to keep customers loyal. The increase highlights a big turnaround from Verizon's last earnings report, which for the first time saw the company losing wireless customers faster than it could replace them. Those alarming results could have grown even worse without the release of Verizon's unlimited data plan, analysts said, which helped slow some of the losses. At the time, Verizon said it had lost nearly 400,000 phone subscribers early in the quarter, but it managed to pare those defections back to 289,000 with the introduction of unlimited data. [Why it took more than a week to resolve the Verizon data leak] Fast forward to today, and Verizon not only appears to have reversed the trend but is growing again. Much of that is attributable to record-low levels of customers leaving the network, said chief financial officer Matt Ellis. “That's certainly contributed to the net adds,” Ellis said on an investor call Thursday, “and showed that once we had a comparable offer out there … even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high quality network experience we deliver.” Verizon's strong report came a day after the market research firm RootMetrics called the company's network the best in the nation, saying that the popularity of unlimited data plans has not hurt network performance. Verizon had historically resisted unlimited data, arguing that customers did not need or want the option. But the company's tune changed as rivals such as T-Mobile began making strides with unlimited plans of their own. Thanks in part to unlimited data, customers across the wireless industry have remained remarkably loyal to their carriers — despite a promotional move by Sprint to offer a free year of service, Walt Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG, said in a research note Thursday.

While Verizon’s wireless business is seeing customers jump ship, wireless remains roughly 70% of the company’s revenue, according to Morningstar analyst Petra Vacval. Verizon is still very much reliant on wireless. “Trying to pivot a tanker doesn’t happen in a quarter,” Vacval said. “Yes you’ve seen the customer declines and the stock has been beaten up, but this is a huge company with really good margins, so it’s not like they need to do something tomorrow.” Verizon is set to report earnings for the second quarter before the market opens on Thursday. Here’s what investors can expect: Earnings: Verizon is expected to report earnings of 96 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be a slight improvement compared with the 94 cents the company reported during the same quarter a year ago, and the 95 cents per share reported for the first quarter. Verizon has beaten or met FactSet consensus estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters. Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, also expects Verizon to post earnings of 96 cents per share. Revenue: Analysts polled by FactSet expect revenue for the quarter to hit $29.86 billion, down more than 2% compared with the year-earlier period and less than 1% from the first quarter. Verizon has missed FactSet consensus in six of the last 10 quarters. Estimize is expecting Verizon revenue to hit $29.89 billion. Share price: Analysts tracking the stock have an average 12-month target of $49.08, according to FactSet, which would represent about a 12% premium to current trading levels. Analysts also rate Verizon a hold, on average. Shares of Verizon are down nearly 18% in the year to date and more than 21% in the trailing 12-month period. By comparison, the S&P 500

151,Austen Hufford,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 27, 2017 6:12 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp.'s entertainment unit surged in the second quarter, helped by the strong box-office performance of ""The Fate of the Furious,"" lifting profit and revenue even as cable video subscriber losses ticked up. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue rose 17% to $8.33 billion. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division jumped 60%, thanks to the latest installment of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise. The cable networks and broadcast TV units grew revenue and earnings due to increases in subscription fees from pay TV providers, but both also saw a decline in ad sales because of ratings softness. Cable networks' ad revenues declined 0.9% to $906 million, while broadcast TV ad revenue declined 1.2% to $1.27 billion. In the cable business, the company lost 34,000 residential and business video customers, compared with a loss of 4,000 in the same quarter last year. Comcast has generally managed to withstand the turmoil in cable TV from cord-cutting better than some peers in pay television. In a tough environment, with consumers gravitating to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Sling TV, the company has added net video subscribers in five of the past seven quarters. The cord-cutting has taken a toll on TV ratings, however, for NBCUniversal's channels just like those of many other media companies. Comcast and industry analysts point to its investment in X1, a cloud-based, set-top box system, as a reason its video business has held up. The company said that 55% of its residential video customers now have X1, up from nearly 40% in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast added 175,000 total internet customers in the second quarter, down from 220,000 in the year-earlier period. Total revenue per customer relationship, Comcast's unit revenue figure for its cable division, increased 2.2% to $151.19. Comcast lost 22,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 64,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 61% of revenue, rose 5.5% to $13.12 billion. Comcast recently launched a new wireless service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast, along fellow cable provider Charter Communications Inc., has explored a deal with Sprint Corp. that could provide an alternative reseller arrangement, potentially with better terms, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. In all, net income rose to $2.51 billion, or 52 cents a share, up from about $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 9.8% to $21.17 billion. Revenue and profit exceeded estimates from analysts, who were projecting earnings of 48 cents a share on $20.86 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.

152,Michael Brush,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 20, 2017 4:54 p.m. ET Five areas of the global market will benefit from a weak greenback By Republicans tripped up the U.S. dollar this week by failing to make progress on replacing Obamacare. This hurt the greenback by casting doubts on other reforms promised by President Donald Trump — including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Big picture, the GOP’s Obamacare setback is really only part of the problem for the dollar. Even if politicians miraculously get their act together (don't hold your breath) the dollar is still in for trouble. In fact, it's been weak all year for reasons that have little to do with Washington, D.C. — and those issues aren't going away soon. Indeed these challenges could bring a surprise breakdown in the dollar later this year, forcing investors to make some painful portfolio adjustments, says Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. Below, I offer a five-step plan on how to position your own portfolio now, to profit from the moves others will have to make later as dollar weakens further. But first, here are the three main reasons this unexpected dollar weakness will play out. 1: A global recovery is bidding up the value of other currencies For most of the recovery since 2009, U.S. growth has outpaced foreign growth. That made the dollar more attractive. People had to buy it to get access to more favorable U.S. growth. Nowadays, though, about two thirds of foreign economies are growing faster than the U.S. Europe is a good example. ""The economy is growing well above its potential, and while full employment is still a ways off, it now seems very achievable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile, growth in China has stabilized, erasing fears about a potential meltdown there. And many emerging markets are back on track. All of this means investment dollars are flowing out of U.S. assets into foreign countries. This, of course, puts downward pressure on the dollar and drives up foreign currencies. The trend is likely to persist. Leading economic indicators suggest foreign economies will continue to do well relative to the U.S. 2: Foreign bonds are becoming more attractive For much of the recovery, U.S. government bond yields were more attractive than foreign bond yields. But now, as foreign economies strengthen, that's changing. ""For the first time in more than five years, foreign bond yields are finally becoming more competitive relative to U.S. yield offerings,"" Paulsen says. This, too, is channeling money out of the U.S. and into foreign countries, driving up their currencies relative to the dollar. 3: U.S. inflation will heat up Many pundits think the greenback will hang in there because the Fed is hiking interest rates. This will entice foreign investors to buy dollars to get access to those higher yields, according to this theory. But to really understand what is going on here and what it means for the dollar, you have to consider why the Fed is hiking rates. And that spells trouble for the dollar. The Fed is raising rates because it sees signs of higher inflation. It wants raise rates to fulfill one of its two mandates — controlling inflation. To anyone owning dollars, inflation is bad news. It means they'll have less purchasing power. So they naturally sell greenbacks. Indeed, history is replete with evidence that the dollar weakens when inflation rises. The best example: High inflation during the 1970s hammered the dollar. Don't make the mistake of being lulled by the June inflation slowdown. That was probably caused by one-off events. One was the sharp decline in cell-phone prices linked to the rising popularity of unlimited plans. Another was measurement problems related to changes in how doctors report their fees to government statisticians, Zandi says. ""The Fed continues to downplay the recent drop in core inflation,” agrees Barclays economist  Blerina Uruçi. Leuthold’s Paulsen thinks tight labor markets will soon push wage inflation above 3%, and this will boost consumer prices as people buy more stuff. ""We expect inflation anxieties to worsen in the second half of this year,"" he says. If inflation suppresses the dollar, as it normally does, matters will get worse. A weaker dollar bids up commodity prices. This leads to more inflation. And this erodes the dollar even more. Partly because of this feedback loop, a breakdown in the dollar could push wage and consumer price inflation to 3%-4%, says Paulsen, which would shock a lot of people. A key factor to watch: Any move in the dollar below its current trading range. Since early 2015, the U.S. Dollar Index

If it breaks out of that range to the downside, it will wake up a lot of investors to the potential for more dollar weakness. They'll scramble to adjust their portfolios. What to buy now: Here's what you can do now to benefit as investors make necessary changes to adapt to this new investing climate. Paulsen provided guidance on the themes below, and I've filled in suggestions on specific stocks and exchange traded funds. 1. Buy commodities: A weaker dollar pushes up commodity prices.

153,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"There has been a flurry of dealmaking for fiber assets, as growing demand from U.S. businesses for data transmission has fueled a revival in fiber optic services and is pushing large telecommunication companies to bulk up in fiber. No deal between WideOpenWest and Verizon is certain and negotiations could still fall apart, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Another buyer could still emerge for the asset, the sources added. WideOpenWest, which has market capitalization of around $1.4 billion and went public in May, is working with a financial adviser to explore a sale of the unit, the people said. WideOpenWest did not respond to a request for comment. Verizon declined to comment. Since 2014, WideOpenWest has built about 1,200 miles of fiber in the Chicago market for a “leading wireless carrier,” according to a corporate filing. The sources identified this carrier as Verizon. Verizon uses WideOpenWest’s fiber system in Chicago for backhaul, which is the data transfer of mobile traffic over wired lines, according to the sources. While it is under a long-term contract with the wireless carrier, WideOpenWest had said it expected it would find more business customers to use the fiber. Verizon reported quarterly revenue that topped analyst expectations on Thursday, adding 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers.. ","

154,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported quarterly revenue that topped expectations on Thursday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier attracted more subscribers with its unlimited data plan. Shares jumped 3.6 percent to $46.01 in premarket trading. In the quarter, Verizon added 614,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, including tablet customers, compared to an increase of 615,000 in the year-earlier period. The additions were higher than the JPMorgan estimate of 115,000 and consensus expectations of 70,000, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note on Thursday. Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones. In February, Verizon reintroduced an unlimited data plan for the first time in more than five years. Since then, other carriers have launched aggressive promotions. Sprint said in June that it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. The company added 358,000 phone-only subscribers, compared with 86,000 net additions a year ago. Verizon’s unlimited plan, priced at $80 a month for a single line, is more expensive than competing plans. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said Thursday’s post-earnings conference call that “even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver.” Churn, or the rate of customer defections for subscribers paying a monthly bill, was flat at 0.94 percent from the year-earlier period, and lower than analysts’ estimates of 1.1 percent, according to JPMorgan. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, called the subscriber numbers “very strong,” but added that “we remain cautious on Verizon equity given what we regard as unsustainable margins and returns in a competitive market.” Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.36 billion, or $1.07 per share, in the second quarter, from $702 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 96 cents per share. Total operating revenue edged up to $30.55 billion from $30.53 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents on revenue of $29.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The latest quarter included a gain from the sale of data centers and lower expenses. Earnings in the year-earlier period were also hurt by a strike in the wireline business. ","

155,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Charter Communications Inc said on Sunday it was not interested in acquiring U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp, leaving the latter’s majority owner, SoftBank Group Corp, pondering how to orchestrate a merger. A merger of Charter and Sprint would create a telecommunications powerhouse, providing a one-stop shop for customers looking for internet and mobile phone services, and giving the combined company a stronger footing in creating the infrastructure required for so-called 5G wireless technology. SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is considering making an acquisition offer for Charter, which has a market capitalization of $101 billion and another $60 billion in debt, as early as this week, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, in what would be by far the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate’s biggest ever deal. SoftBank remains interested in merging Sprint with T-Mobile US Inc, another U.S. wireless carrier controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, with which Sprint held deal negotiations earlier this year, the source added. The source asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. SoftBank declined to comment. “We understand why a deal is attractive for SoftBank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint,” a Charter spokesman said in an emailed statement on Sunday. He declined to comment on whether Charter would entertain a bid from SoftBank and at what price. Sprint and T-Mobile could not be immediately reached for comment. SoftBank’s potential bid for Charter would follow the conclusion of two months of negotiations with Charter and larger cable peer Comcast Corp over Sprint potentially serving as their mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), allowing them to use its network to offer wireless services. “We have a very good MVNO relationship with Verizon Communications Inc and intend to launch wireless services to cable customers next year,” the Charter spokesman said. SoftBank’s interest in Charter also shows it is looking for alternatives to strengthen its negotiating hand in Sprint’s negotiations with T-Mobile, analysts said. “This could be a way to gain leverage in a T-Mobile deal,”  Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said of Son’s pursuit of Charter on Sunday. To be sure, a bid for Charter by SoftBank, which has a market capitalization of 9.9 trillion yen ($90.3 billion), would be a stretch for its finances, given that it would likely be without the deployment of the $100 billion technology-focused investment fund called Vision Fund it raised this year. Sprint’s market capitalization is just $32.8 billion, and it has a similar amount in debt. A bid for Charter that would give SoftBank majority control in a deal would require raising tens of billions of dollars in new debt and could push SoftBank to leverage some of its other assets, including its 29.5 percent stake in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and its 43 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. SoftBank shares were trading down 2.7 percent at 8,920 yen on Monday morning in Tokyo. Another hurdle for SoftBank would be the price expectations of Charter’s largest shareholder, John Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. Charter’s proxy statement to its shareholders in March showed that CEO Tom Rutledge has compensation incentives to take Charter’s share price to more than $564. Charter shares ended trading on Friday at $370.26. What is more, were Charter to agree to a merger with Sprint, it would need the blessing of Comcast. Charter and Comcast announced an agreement in May that bars either company from entering into a material transaction in wireless for a year without the other’s consent. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, also expressed interest in a takeover of Charter earlier this year, sources have said. Verizon, which has a healthier network than Sprint, has MVNO agreements in place with both Charter and Comcast, which are rolling out wireless plans for their customers using the Verizon partnership. Three years ago, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. That deal would have put SoftBank in control of the merged company, with Deutsche Telekom becoming a minority shareholder. T-Mobile was worth around $30 billion at the time, but its market value has since risen to more than $50 billion as it overtook Sprint as the No. 3 wireless carrier by subscribers. While Sprint’s customer base has also grown under CEO Marcelo Claure and financials have improved, the growth was primarily driven by heavy price discounts. Despite new investment, the company’s network is still viewed by many consumers as weaker than its rivals. Unless Sprint can clinch a merger with a peer, these investment requirements are set to become more pressing. Carriers will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade to 5G networks that promise to be 10 times to 100 times faster than current speeds. ","

157,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) SINGAPORE, August 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Singapore Telecommunications Limited's (Singtel) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs), as well as its senior unsecured rating, at 'A+'. The agency has also affirmed at 'A' the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR and senior unsecured rating of Singtel's wholly owned subsidiary, Singtel Optus Pty Limited (Optus). The Outlook on the IDRs is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Rating Headroom: The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that Singtel can maintain FFO adjusted net leverage below 2.0x - the level at which Fitch would consider negative rating action - for the financial year ending March 2019 (FY19) and FY20, particularly if the company uses the SGD2.3 billion proceeds from NetLink NBN Trust's IPO for its investment needs and debt reduction. Singtel faces significant capex needs and spectrum payments in the current fiscal year amid slowing growth in Singapore and Australia. Singtel will have limited headroom under its ratings, although the Netlink IPO proceeds provide some flexibility. Singtel has yet to confirm how it will use the Netlink IPO proceeds. We may consider negative rating action if the company choose to increase shareholder returns, rather than use the proceeds to reduce debt and fund critical investment needs, which will indicate a more aggressive policy for its capital structure. Slow Organic Growth: Singtel's FFO growth is likely to remain weak in view of the increasing competitive pressures and the continued EBITDA losses in its digital life (DL) business operations. Competition in Singapore and Australia will intensify with TPG Telecom's entry as the fourth mobile network operator in Singapore, although large investments undertaken in these markets and improvement in the financial performance of its DL businesses should support cash generation. Singtel's credit profile also benefits from its diversified cash flows, which include a steady stream of dividends from its associates. Including dividends from associates, the overseas operations of Singtel account for two-thirds of the group's adjusted operating EBITDA. Singtel has a substantial investment in its 36.5%-associate Bharti Airtel Limited (BBB-/Stable), but the Indian telco provides very little dividend contribution to Singtel due to its large capex requirements and the stiff competition it faces. High Capex, Spectrum Fees: Singtel continues to face heavy capex burden in the next two years to drive its mobile operations. It expects to spend SGD2.4 billion in cash capex and another SGD1.0 billion in spectrum payments in Singapore and Australia in FY18. Singtel will undertake network expansion in its regional 4G coverage in Australia and multi-year investments in new unified billing and customer care systems. Fitch forecasts the company's pre-dividend FCF margin to remain in the mid-teens over the medium term (FY17: 15%). M&A Risk, Financial Flexibility: Fitch believes Singtel will continue to undertake acquisitions, if suitable opportunities arise. However, we will treat any M&A as event risk, and will evaluate the impact of any acquisitions on Singtel's credit profile based on cost, incremental cash generation and funding mix. Singtel's other non-core assets including its minority stakes in Singapore Post and Southern Cross, could provide additional funding flexibility if these are monetised; however, we have not included these as sources of cash in our analysis of Singtel's credit profile. Notching for Parental Support: Singtel's 'A+' ratings factor in one notch of support above its standalone ratings to reflect Singapore's (AAA/Stable) majority state ownership (52% at end-March 2017) through Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek). Singtel is Temasek's largest investment, accounting for about 12% of total investment value of SGD275 billion at end-March 2017. Strong Regional Play: Singtel's standalone credit profile of 'A' reflects its diversified income stream through its solid market position in Singapore, number two market position in Australia through Optus, and leading market positions in Indonesia, India, the Philippines and Thailand through associates. Singtel expects major associates to contribute SGD1.4 billion in cash dividends in FY18, as the inclusion of dividends from Intouch Holdings Public Company offset the expected lower payout from Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited (AIS, BBB+/Stable). Singtel acquired a 21% stake in Intouch, the Thailand-based parent of AIS, in 2016. Strong Optus-Singtel Link: The strong linkage between Optus and Singtel leads to an equalisation of Optus's rating with Singtel's standalone credit profile of 'A'. Singtel owns 100% of Optus and maintains full control through the board. Fitch expects Optus's EBITDA and revenue to grow at only a low single-digit rate in FY18, given higher opex and intense competition. DERIVATION SUMMARY Singtel's 'A+' ratings include a one-notch uplift above its standalone ratings to reflect Singapore's majority state ownership, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. Singtel is also Temasek's single largest investment. The uplift for state support is consistent with that of China Telecom Corporation Limited (CTCL; A+/Stable, standalone profile: A), which is majority owned by the state and is strategically important due to its nationwide fixed-line infrastructure. The uplift is, however, limited to one-notch, compared with Singapore Power Limited's (AA-/Stable) two-notch uplift, as Temasek owns 100% of the utility and has extended tangible support to it previously. On a standalone basis, Singtel's credit profile is well-positioned relative to Asian telecom peers, such as CTCL and KT Corporation (A-/Stable), in terms of its regional scale, cash flow diversification and mid-teens pre-dividend FCF margin. Singtel's FFO adjusted net leverage of around 2.0x is in line with that of CTCL but lower than the 3.0x-3.5x of Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable) and AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative). Meanwhile, Optus's rating is equalised with Singtel's standalone credit profile of 'A', given the strong linkage between the two entities. Optus's standalone credit profile is positioned in between that of KT Corporation and Telekom Malaysia Berhad (A-Stable; standalone profile: BBB+). KT is less leveraged at FFO adjusted net leverage of below 1.5x and its EBITDA is twice as large as Optus's, which offset its thinner EBITDA margins of 22%. Meanwhile, Telekom Malaysia operates at a similar net leverage of 2.3x-2.5x as Optus, and benefits from its market dominance and lower competitive pressures in the fixed-line market. Nevertheless, Optus has both strong mobile and fixed-line broadband offerings. No country-ceiling or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Group revenue growth of mid-single-digits in FY18 following the Turn acquisition in April 2017, then moderating to low-single-digit percentages over the medium term - Operating EBITDAR margin to remain stable at around 30% (FY17: 31%) in FY18-FY20, reflecting higher contributions from lower-margin group enterprise revenues and stiffer telecom competition in Singapore and Australia - DL's EBITDA losses to narrow to around SGD100 million in FY18 (FY17: SGD122 million), and the division to break even in EBITDA in FY21 - Stable dividends from associates of SGD1.5 billion-1.6 billion in FY18-FY20 - Annual cash capex of SGD3.4 billion in FY18 (FY17: SGD2.5 billion), including SGD1.0 billion spectrum fees. Cash capex to reduce to SGD2.1 billion-2.4 billion in FY19-FY20 - SGD2.3 billion proceeds from divestment of Singtel's stake in NetLink in FY18 - No major debt-funded M&A or asset sales - No significant increase in shareholder distribution with annual dividend payments of SGD2.8 billion-2.9 billion, translating to 73% payout ratio (FY17: 73%), which is in line with Singtel's stated policy of 60%-75% of underlying profit. RATING SENSITIVITIES Singtel Positive: There is limited upside potential for Singtel's rating in the short to medium term, although developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - FFO-adjusted net leverage falling below 1.0x (FY17: 2.2x), with positive post-dividend FCF on a sustained basis, provided the linkages with the state also remain unchanged. - Strengthening of linkages between Singtel and the state, which would arise from stronger tangible support to Singtel from Temasek Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Failure to reduce FFO-adjusted net leverage below 2.0x and/or raise FFO fixed-charge coverage above 7.0x (FY17: 7.6x) on a sustained basis, or if Singtel were to demonstrate a lack of commitment to improve its financial profile - as indicated by a more aggressive shareholder return policy - Weakening of ties between Temasek and Singtel Optus Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Upgrade of Singtel's standalone credit profile, provided that the linkages between Optus and Singtel remain intact - Emergence of significant legal linkages between the two entities (from debt guarantees from Singtel or cross-default provisions that link the two entities, for example) which may lead us to link Optus' rating to Singtel's IDR instead of Singtel's standalone profile. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Downgrade of Singtel's standalone ratings or a weakening of the linkages between Singtel and Optus. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Singtel has SGD3.1 billion of debt due in the next 12 months. However, its liquidity is adequate due to its strong access to capital markets and banks, which is underpinned by its regional market reach, robust financial position and as an entity linked to the Singapore state. In addition, the company had an unrestricted cash balance of SGD534 million at end-March 2017 and undrawn committed bank facilities to tap.

(AABA), the remnants of Yahoo after its sale of its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), is buying back as much as $5 billion in shares. (See more: What Is Altaba Anyway?) In an announcement, the company, which in essence is a holding company for large stakes in Chinese ecommerce​ giant Alibaba Group (BABA) and Yahoo Japan, said the board approved the share repurchase program as part of its efforts to return cash to its investors. In June, it disclosed it bought back around 64.5 million shares or about 6.7% of the outstanding shares. ""We have consistently stated that it is our intent to return substantially all of our cash to shareholders over time (of course retaining what we need to cover liabilities and operate the Fund)—and with this action, we state it again today, clearly,"" said Thomas J. McInerney, chief executive officer of Altaba in a prepared statement. Altaba said that when it purchases the shares will depend on the market conditions and supersedes the existing buyback programs authorized in March 2015 when it was  operating as Yahoo. Recently, shares of the company were trading 0.19% higher or $0.11 a share to $58.51. In late June, the stock reached a high of $60.22 shortly after it started trading under its new ticker. (See more: Altaba Stock Breaks Out After Verizon Sale.) Altaba’s shares have had bumpy ride as investors try to figure out what the new company is all about. One of the most attractive aspects of it is its 15% stake in Alibaba, which, according to media reports is valued at around $341 billion. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, it warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. As a result, Altaba’s stock will likely rise as shares of Alibaba do, which is the case being made by JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth, who initiated coverage in late June with overweight rating and a $65 price target. According to a media report covering the action, Anmuth said that every 10% increase in Alibaba’s value means a 7% increase in Altaba’s net asset value. With a $65 price target, the analyst thinks shares can increase more than 10%. Altaba’s stake in Yahoo Japan is valued at $7.7 billion. The company also has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon.

160,Rani Molla,8032017,CNBC,7272017,"Unlimited data plans are slowing down mobile speeds for Verizon and AT&T customers, according to  data released today by mobile network measurement company OpenSignal. Verizon and AT&T reinstated their unlimited plans in February to compete with T-Mobile and Sprint, which have long offered unlimited data plans, and have since seen a deluge of demand. Greater data demand — either more data usage or more customers — means slower speeds. Think of it as increased traffic on a highway. Verizon and AT&T also have  nearly double the subscribers of T-Mobile and Sprint, so changes in their offerings hit their networks harder. More from Recode: 500 Startups surveys the early wreckage of a sexual harassment scandalFacebook says changes to how it hires are making the company more diverseFacebook's latest News Feed change could push more publishers to Instant Articles Carriers have long supported greater leeway to manage their networks as part of the U.S. government's fierce debate over net neutrality. T-Mobile's unlimited plan  often limits video streaming quality in a bid to ease the burden on its network; others like Verizon recently have tested similar tools to improve speeds. To staunch advocates of open internet rules, however, these techniques  violate the spirit of federal safeguards meant to ensure all web traffic is treated equally. Both Verizon and AT&T saw a notable decline in speeds after introducing unlimited plans. T-Mobile and Sprint have been able to gradually account for the increase in data demand, so their speeds weren't negatively affected this year — indeed, they both got faster since OpenSignal's February report. U.S. mobile speeds are generally  slower than other developed countries. Verizon and T-Mobile were basically tied for speeds at the beginning of this year. Now, T-Mobile has taken the lead with an average LTE download speed of 17.5 Mbps, compared with Verizon's 14.9 Mbps. Unsurprisingly, unlimited data plans are very popular, as consumers spend more time and complete more activities on their phones.  Ericsson expects typical North American smartphone users to blow through 25 GB of data a month in 2022, up from 5 GB in 2016, making unlimited data plans even more appealing. For this report, OpenSignal collected over five billion measurements from 172,919 U.S. smartphones during the month of June with its signal mapping app. ",Verizon and AT&T customers have slower speeds because unlimited data,0.9292

Trade became a surprise target during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, symbolizing globalization run amok for both political parties. Trump backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership shortly after taking office and has threatened to pull out of NAFTA. Republicans and centrist Democrats who traditionally support trade were caught off guard. Tech firms are trying to get ahead of potentially similar repercussions. Amazon held a job fair on Wednesday to hire 50,000 workers – and hopes to sign up double that amount by next summer. It also pays for hourly associates to obtain a two-year degree in an in-demand field like medical lab technology or aircraft mechanics.

Shares of  Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) popped on Thursday morning, trading 6.5% higher as of 11:15 a.m. EDT. The fuel for this fire came from Verizon's second-quarter earnings report, which it posted before the opening bell. Verizon's revenue held flat year over year at $35.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share rose from $0.94 to $0.96. The bottom-line result landed right where with Wall Street had expected it to, but the sales result was a modestly positive surprise. More importantly, Verizon added 590,000 net new subscribers in the all-important postpaid smartphones category. Retail postpaid phone churn landed below 0.9% per month for the ninth consecutive quarter, setting an all-time low in the LTE era at 0.7%. Low churn equals loyal customers, so that's great news for Verizon and its investors. Image source: Getty Images. This rosy report put a decisive stop to Verizon's recent share price slide, but the stock is still trading roughly 12% lower year to date. Management gave credit for these solid results to the February launch of all-new unlimited wireless data plans. Looking ahead, Verizon simply reaffirmed its view that full-year results in 2017 should stay close to the figures posted in 2016 on both the top and bottom lines. All things considered, Big Red earned this reprieve from share price pressures and today's market reaction makes perfect sense. Recouping what it's lost will take a couple more of these positive reports. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

164,Adam Levy,8032017,Fool,7272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) blew away expectations with its second-quarter earnings report. Not only did it post a big beat on the top line, but it also showed investors that its unlimited data plan is working to attract subscribers. Verizon added 358,000 postpaid phone subscribers last quarter, well above analysts' expectations. That picks up where Verizon left off in the first quarter. While the company lost 289,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the first three months of the year, management said it would have lost much more without introducing its unlimited plan in February. Now investors are asking whether the momentum is sustainable. Image source: Verizon. Verizon posted a record low churn level for its postpaid phone subscribers in the LTE era. Just 0.7% of phone subscribers left for a competitor last quarter. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) gave a good indication that Verizon would post a good churn number when it reported very low porting ratios with Verizon with its earnings report. Management says its ability to retain subscribers is directly a result of its unlimited data plan. At $80 per month for a single line (and discounts as you add more lines), Verizon's pricing is competitive, but still a slight premium to most of its competitors. The only provider with higher pricing is AT&T (NYSE:T), but its $90-per-month plan includes additional incentives like a $25 discount on TV service and free HBO. Verizon says its ability to retain customers shows people are willing to pay more for a comparable plan on a superior network. Indeed, Verizon's network and brand are two of its biggest competitive advantages. Those advantages shined through later in the quarter as competitors started offering significant switching incentives, including Sprint's (NYSE:S) offer of a free year of unlimited data service. But Verizon's performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with the first part, according to management. Of course, retaining subscribers is only half the battle. In order to grow, Verizon had to attract new subscribers. Importantly, it didn't have to resort to expensive customer acquisition promotions like Sprint or AT&T. That's a strong indication that many subscribers were simply avoiding Verizon until it offered a simple unlimited plan like its competitors. It's another testament to the company's brand strength. Adding new subscribers to its unlimited plan is key for Verizon, which has seen its service revenue take a hit with the release of the new option. The early adopters of the plan were existing customers that realized they could save money by switching. Combined with other service revenue headwinds like the switch to equipment installment plans, Verizon's service revenue fell nearly 7% year over year. Adding new subscribers at the higher-than-average unlimited plan pricing should help start turning things around for Verizon. Indeed, management indicated its belief that service revenue has bottomed and will start to turn around in the second half of the year. Management expects the decline in service revenue to come in below 4% by the fourth quarter. As comparable quarters get easier, investors should see service revenue return to growth sometime next year, and operating margin should improve along with it. The wireless industry is extremely competitive, and Verizon has the most to lose. Verizon's ability to sustain the success it saw in the last two quarters is imperative. To that end, management is extremely optimistic. ""We absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable,"" CFO Matt Ellis said on the second-quarter earnings call. ""Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace."" There are a lot of things working in Verizon's favor for the near future. AT&T's focus is split in favor of its entertainment business, appealing to a shrinking crowd of pay-TV subscribers. Sprint is desperate for help, and looking for it wherever it can get it. T-Mobile is even showing signs of net addition slow downs, and it recently took steps to raise its prices, indicating a bigger focus on generating meaningful cash flow instead of stealing away customers. As long as Verizon focuses on keeping its industry-leading network at the top of the charts and maintaining the strength of its brand, it should be able to win back a lot of customers with its unlimited plan. Over time, that should translate into improved service revenue and higher operating margin as well. ","
      
    How Verizon Added 358,000 New Phone Subscribers Last Quarter -- The Motley Fool

165,Brian Stoffel,8032017,Fool,7272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You could be forgiven for thinking this is an odd pairing. What's the point in comparing the stocks of a major communications company like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) with the world's leading provider of sugary, carbonated drinks -- in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)? The answer is simple: Given each one's size and stability, they are both popular picks for retirement portfolios. Indeed, each is currently offering dividend yields north of 3%, making them enticing picks in our current low-rate environment. Image source: Getty Images. But which is the better buy today? That's a very difficult question to answer, especially because they're in such different industries. That said, we're going to examine each through three different lenses, in an attempt to figure out which is the better deal. Here's how they stack up. For true long-term investors, there's nothing more important than a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as a ""moat."" In Verizon and Coke, we have stalwarts with relatively wide moats, though both are currently shrinking. The problem, however, is that the powerhouse Coke brands have been receding for years. In fact, soda drinking in the United States peaked over a decade ago and recorded its 11th  straight year of declines in 2016. As America and the world become more health-conscious, they are turning away from traditional Coke products. Verizon, on the other hand, benefits from the size and quality of its network, as well as sky-high barriers to entry. According to Statista, the top four wireless providers control over 95% of the market in the United States, with Verizon coming in first with a 35% share. Verizon is also branching out of being ""just"" a communications company by acquiring content owners and providers, such as parts of Yahoo! and AOL. While the company has been pressured lately by no-contract plans from rivals, it still holds the top-dog status, and it's in an industry likely to stay relevant for the foreseeable future. As I mentioned at the outset, investors are primarily interested in dividends when they purchase shares of these two. So while it makes sense to want all of the cash coming in to go out in the form of dividends, there's something to say for keeping a nice pile of cash on hand. That's because every company, at one point or another, will face difficult economic times. Whether macro or company-specific in nature, those that enter these periods with cash will have options -- buy back shares on the cheap, acquire weaker competitors, or outspend rivals into oblivion -- and likely emerge stronger than before. Keeping in mind that Coke is valued at a 7% premium to Verizon by market cap, here's how the two stack up. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $5.4 billion $113 billion $12.3 billion ($0.126 billion) Coke $43 billion $32 billion $6.2 billion $6.8 billion Data sources: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. Here we have a pretty clear winner. Coke not only has a much more favorable cash position relative to its debt, but it also brought in tons of free cash flow over the past year, while Verizon was negative. To be fair, much of Verizon's debt is as a result of acquiring companies that add to its moat -- including the remaining stake it didn't hold in Verizon Wireless. And free cash flow was unusually low over the past year because of one-time charges. Still, it's the trade-off that management made: strengthen the moat while weakening financial fortitude, at least over the medium term. Finally, we have the murky science of valuation. While there's no single metric that can tell you if a stock is cheap or expensive, there are a number of data points we can consult. Here are five that I like to use. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Ratio Verizon 12 NM 4.8 5.2% 7,300% Coke 24 28 4.9 3.3% 89%* Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E calculated using non-GAAP earnings when possible. NM = not meaningful due to negative cash flow. * Coke's dividend payments were normalized to have been paid once per quarter in the past four quarters. Because of calendar irregularities, that is not how they appear on the company statements. Things get murky here. Because Verizon's free cash flow was negative, it makes price-to-free cash flow meaningless, suggesting that the stock is expensive. At the same time, on an earnings basis, it appears to be trading at a 50% discount to Coke. And when it comes to growth trends (the PEG ratio), both stocks look ridiculously expensive. To get a more clear-headed view, I went back and saw that Verizon has averaged $13.4 billion  in free cash flow over the past three fiscal years. Using that as a proxy is imprecise, but it gives us a P/FCF ratio of 13 and a payout ratio, based on the current dividend, of just 70%. Looked at in this light, I believe Verizon to be a cheaper stock for dividend investors. So there you have it: Coke has the benefit of a powerful brand and a loaded balance sheet. Verizon has chosen to take a little risk with debt, but given the telecom giant's moat and reliable cash flow streams from its subscribers, I believe Verizon to be the better bet at today's prices.

    Better Buy: The Coca-Cola Co. vs. Verizon Communications Inc. -- The Motley Fool

Sometimes, seemingly good ideas fail. That's what happened with Frontier Communications' (NASDAQ:FTR) decision to spend $10.54 billion buying Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) former wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That move made sense when it happened. It was a bold attempt to lower costs per customer by allowing the company to spread expenses over more subscribers. Basically, the Verizon deal was Frontier's attempt to go from the minor leagues to the majors, and it turned out to be a mistake. In closing the CTF deal, Frontier took ownership of roughly 3.7 million voice connections, 2.2 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video connections in California, Florida, and Texas. That was supposed to give the company operating scale to lower expenses, and that part of the deal actually worked. CEO Daniel McCarthy, a man who can see the bright side in any piece of bad news, has been publicly optimistic since the CTF deal closed. During his company's Q1 earnings call, he explained just how much money the purchase has saved the company. ""We're pleased to have met our target of realizing $1.25 billion in annualized synergies,"" McCarthy said. The company expects to achieve another incremental $350 million in annual savings by midyear 2018. That's the good news, but it's essentially the only positive for the company. Frontier has gotten more efficient, but it's having a very hard time holding on to the subscribers it paid $10.54 billion for. Cord-cutting has changed the game for cable companies. Image source: Getty Images. In the four quarters since the CTF purchase closed, Frontier has lost subscribers. McCarthy has had seemingly valid excuses each time. At first he blamed the switch from Verizon; then he blamed a lack of marketing. For the past two quarters he has said the problem was customers who made the switch but never paid. The reality is that Frontier made the Verizon deal at a time when the market was changing. Cord cutting, or dropping cable for streaming services, has slowly sped up, giving consumers more options. That's very bad news for Frontier, which operated by entering markets with established cable companies and offering an alternative. The company used cheaper prices, at least during a promotional period, to lure people in. It was a market strategy that worked because people often disliked their cable provider. In the current market, however, Frontier is one option among many. It perhaps remains attractive for disgruntled customers of its bigger rivals who still want a traditional cable and broadband package, but it's not competitive in cases where people are looking to spend less by switching to streaming alternatives. Frontier has taken away much of the incentive shareholders had to own the stock. That included the recent double-whammy of a 1-for-15 reverse stock split and slashing its dividend from $0.105 to $0.04 per share, beginning with the recent June 30 payment. Those moves were needed to avoid being delisted and to be able to service its debt. Frontier lost $587 million in 2016, almost twice the $316 million it lost the previous year. As it continues to lose subscribers each quarter, there's little reason to think it can reverse those losses. Frontier and its shareholders made a bet that bigger would be better. A few years earlier, that would have proved to be true. In the current marketplace, however, being a bigger small player has not worked out. It's hard to see a path forward for Frontier that results in a return to profit. The best-case scenario is that a bigger player buys the company, but if that happened, it would be a fire sale. This is a money-losing company facing market conditions that make a turnaround unlikely. Frontier has very good management that will prolong its existence, but the end result remains inevitable.

Kline,8032017,Fool,7272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it cones to delivering a product people like, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) have done a surprisingly good job of keeping people happy, according to a new report from J.D. Power. Sprint (NYSE:S) doesn't score quite as well as its rivals, but all four companies run the risk of losing customers if those users actually need to interact with their carriers. That general customer content (albeit to a much-lower extent with Sprint) bodes well for the major wireless carriers. Poor customer service when something goes wrong could cause that satisfaction to disappear, J.D. Power found it its 2017 U.S. Wireless Customer Care Full-Service Performance Study -- Volume 2. ""A fast resolution to a problem -- whether companies try to solve it in-store, online, or through social media -- is the best way to both avoid customers' ire and curb their temptation of switching providers,"" wrote the consumer insights, advisory services, and data and analytics company. ""This means reducing wait times, training staff to be skilled and knowledgeable, and solving the problem on the first try are issues of paramount importance."" Data from the study noted that there is considerable room for improvement in customer-service related areas. Consumers were specifically upset about the level of effort it takes to get the help they needed. T-Mobile has worked to improve its network. Image source: T-Mobile. Verizon, which recently scored a win on the twice-annual RootMetrics Mobile Performance in the United States report, also took first place here, scoring a 797 out of 900. AT&T came in second with a 796, with T-Mobile just behind at 795. Sprint brought up the rear, scoring a 723. The top three carriers all rated five ""Power Circles,"" which marks them as ""among the best,"" while Sprint scored two, ranking it with ""the rest."" J.D. Power surveyed 9,994 customers who contacted their carrier's customer-care department within the past three months to compile the two studies. In both cases, the research was done from January through June 2017. When things go well, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile enjoy a positive relationship with their customers. People who ""strongly agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" that it takes a lot of effort to speak with a live representative saw satisfaction drop by 210 points compared with those who ""strongly disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that it takes a lot of effort (642 vs. 852, respectively). In addition, how long customers spent on hold and whether their carrier solved their issue on the first try greatly affected satisfaction. ""The first-contact resolution rate is 85% among those who strongly or somewhat disagreed that it required a lot of effort to resolve their most recent issue, compared with only 31% among those who strongly or somewhat agreed,"" according to J.D. Power. The studies also found that while only 5% of customers used social media to resolve issues, those who do have higher satisfaction levels (841 versus 792). In general, people would prefer to solve their issues over the phone. More than half (56%) of those surveyed said that resolving a problem online requires a lot of effort, similar to the 54% who feel that about in-store help. Only 49% of respondents felt that way about trying to solve their problems over the phone. ""Nobody wants to spend a lot of time trying to deal with an issue they shouldn't have had in the first place,"" said J.D. Power's Peter Cunningham. ""Customers believe carriers have a ways to go when it comes to reducing the amount of effort involved in problem resolution. But if carriers focus on it, they will likely see churn decrease and profits increase."" The top three carriers clearly have a good enough product that many customers never encounter a problem. The breaking point for the industry comes when something goes wrong. That leads to possible frustration in getting a quick resolution and the possibility that the consumer will switch carriers. ""With wireless providers getting so competitive about pricing, coupled with the migration from the two-year contract, there are too many options for customers to stay in bad wireless relationships,"" Cunningham said. Basically, the best way for any carrier -- but most specifically Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile -- to hold on to customers is for them to improve customer service. That seems like a relatively easy fix, though it's one on which the industry has perhaps neglected to spend money in favor of other areas, including improving their networks. ","

Yahoo!'s core business is all the applications and websites that made it one of the most well-known early pioneers of the internet. That all became part of Verizon along with most of its 8,600 employees on June 13 for the princely sum of $4.48 billion in cash. That money is being paid to Altaba. In addition to getting Yahoo!'s core business, Verizon also received the Yahoo! brand name. If you owned Yahoo! stock, you will notice a change in your brokerage statement. The shares are now called Altaba and the ticker symbol is AABA. This has all been happening behind the scenes; there is nothing individual shareholders need to do. Altaba is primarily comprised of the non-core foreign assets that were formerly part of Yahoo!, an IP patent portfolio that is called Excalibur, and the cash it received for selling YAHOO!'s core business to Verizon plus cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities it already had on its books. It also has some debt on its books in the form of convertible notes. Image source: Getty images. Altaba was created to maximize shareholder profits and efficiently return cash to shareholders. To do so, the company will try to figure out a tax-efficient strategy to sell its assets and return its cash to stockholders. This is easier said than done due to complex federal and state tax regulations that would take as much as 36.5% of its profits from the sale of foreign assets if they were sold and the cash repatriated back to the United States. Altaba owns shares of two foreign businesses. It owns approximately 36% of Yahoo Japan and approximately 15% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). This table shows the number of shares that Altaba owns and the value of those holdings. Data source: Altaba. The company has a cost basis, or what it paid for both investments, of $5.9 billion. This is a great demonstration of how much money can be made when shares are held long term, as profits on the holdings are over $54 billion. These two holdings comprise the bulk of the value of Altaba. Altaba has stated it had a tax liability of almost $15 billion in its latest proxy statement based on the closing prices for the two stocks as of the end of 2016. Today, that number is even higher based on share prices gains. Altaba also owns minority interests in a variety of other companies, including Hortonworks  and SNAP. These minority stock holdings are relatively small -- about $130 million in value -- in comparison to its holdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which combined are worth more than $60 billion. The patent portfolio, Excalibur, is listed on Alibaba's books as being worth $740 million. All the company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are worth approximately $12 billion. Add up all of Altaba's holdings, and the company is worth roughly $85 per share on a pre-tax basis. The shares trade for over a 30% discount to the pre-tax price, as the market needs to price in the tax burden facing the business. But, investors are hoping management can figure out how to minimize taxes, which would give shares a lift. As share prices change daily, the company has created an almost real-time display of its pre-tax share price and its actual share price that is available at its website. For now, investors will continue to hope that management can find the most tax-efficient method to get cash out of the company and into shareholders' pockets. ","

When Yahoo! sold its operating business to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) for $4.48 billion, that was not the end of Yahoo as a publicly traded investment. What remains of the former Yahoo! company is now known as Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA), and operates as a closed-end management investment company with large holdings in a few handpicked companies. The company boasts a $56 billion market cap, dwarfing the Verizon deal's financial impact. Altaba just shared its first financial update since the Verizon transaction, and also re-upped its share buyback program with a fresh $5 billion commitment. I'm here to give you a quick update on Altaba's affairs. Let's start with an overview of Altaba's three largest holdings. That would be Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Yahoo! Japan, and Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Investment Holding Fair Value as of June 16, 2017 Fair Value as of Dec. 31, 2016 Change Alibaba $51.8 billion $33.7 billion 54% Yahoo! Japan $8.7 billion $7.7 billion 13% Snap $78 million N/A N/A Data source: Altaba. The company then known as Yahoo! also held cash equivalents and marketable debt papers valued at $7.2 billion at the end of 2017. The debt securities alone are now valued at $12.7 billion. The Excalibur operation, which contains a basket of technology patents not related to the core Yahoo! operation and not therefore passed on to Verizon, is now worth an estimated $665 million. All told, investments in businesses affiliated with the old Yahoo! business now add up to $60.6 billion while unaffiliated investments in bank bonds, government debt, and other unrelated affairs work out to a fair value of $12.9 billion. Image source: Alibaba. Altaba's investments were largely set up in the Yahoo! days, often long before the target companies joined the public market. The Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan positions remain unaltered, down to the last share. The fair value changes come from Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba racking up big gains on their own, plus a smattering of currency exchange effects. Between Altaba's two financial reporting dates, the U.S. dollar strengthened by roughly 5% against the Japanese yen and by 2% versus the Chinese renminbi. Meanwhile, both Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan delivered strong share price gains. Alibaba's American depositary shares gained 52% over this period, while the Japanese internet services operation posted a 16% gain. Do keep in mind that these gains already include the currency-based effects. These are still impressive gains. In particular, Alibaba held a successful investor day in June, outlining a bright future of world-class e-commerce operations and a serious commitment to growth outside the Chinese market. This is not a bad time to be a proxy for owning Alibaba, a title Altaba can claim since 70% of its total holdings are directly invested in that stock. In other news, Altaba announced that it had repurchased roughly 6.7% of its own shares in a $3.4 billion tender offer in June and July. To replace that program, which was started under Yahoo! in 2015, the buyback policy was given a fresh $5 billion commitment. ""We have consistently stated that it is our intent to return substantially all of our cash to shareholders over time (of course, retaining what we need to cover liabilities and operate the Fund) -- and with this action, we state it again today, clearly,"" said Altaba CEO Tom McInerney in a prepared statement. The financial data presented earlier did not come from a regular quarterly earnings report, but was simply a first-day accounting of Altaba's assets and liabilities. Altaba has yet to determine when its fiscal year starts and ends, which makes it difficult to estimate when the first earnings report under the new name might turn up. It would make sense to align the fiscal year with this date of inception, meaning June 16, though quarters ending in the middle of a calendar month are pretty rare. So we'll see. At least we know what cards the company is holding now and where it intends to invest any incoming cash flows. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Dividend stocks often form the foundation of every long-term investment and retirement portfolio, and it's not hard to understand why. To begin with, dividend stocks typically have business models that are time-tested. After all, why would a company be paying a recurring dividend if it didn't believe its business would remain profitable? Thus, seeking out dividend stocks often means looking for profitable, time-tested businesses that'll allow us to sleep better at night. Image source: Getty Images. Second, buying dividend stocks helps to hedge against the inevitable stock market corrections that pop up from time to time. Since 1950, according to Yardeni Research, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) has undergone 35 corrections totaling at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number. That's about one correction of at least 10% every two years. While a dividend payment isn't going to counteract the entirety of a possible move lower in equities, your payout over time will act as a comforting hedge that can calm your nerves. Finally, dividend stocks allow investors the opportunity to set up a Drip, or a dividend reinvestment plan. The idea of a Drip is that instead of pocketing the income from your dividend, you're repurchasing more shares of stock with the payout, often on a commission-free basis. Doing so, in a recurring pattern, should yield higher payouts, more shares owned, and a quicker pace of wealth creation. Drips are a common way money managers provide healthy returns for their clients. There's so much more to dividends, however. Here are seven facts about dividends you probably didn't know. Image source: Getty Images. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has only been paying a dividend, following a roughly 17-year hiatus, for the past five years. However, since it began regularly paying a quarterly stipend in August 2012, it's grown into the kingpin of all dividend stocks. Sure, its current dividend yield is only 1.7%, but its quarterly payout has grown by approximately 67% in just five years. Its $0.63-per-share quarterly payout ($2.52 annual) works out to about $13.1 billion being returned to its shareholders via dividends each year. And given its low payout ratio (the percentage of earnings per share it's paying out as a dividend), Apple's dividend is likely to rise even more in the years to come. Do you feel like S&P 500 companies are putting more money into your pockets each quarter? You should. According to data from FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS), aggregate dividends paid on a trailing-12-month basis by S&P 500 companies have increased in each and every quarter, save for one, between the first quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2016. Not only did these payouts grow each quarter, but the aggregate annual payout to shareholders has virtually doubled to $431 billion in less than seven years' time. During this span, the number of S&P 500 companies paying a dividend also grew from around 365 to 419. Image source: Getty Images. Yet in spite of this increase in aggregate payout, the S&P 500 has lost a lot of its income punch over the years. After consistently staying above a 3% yield, or higher, through 1990, the S&P 500's current yield sits below 2%. Part of the blame can go to companies utilizing their cash for stock buybacks and merger and acquisition activity instead of dividends. However, the other component at work is the S&P 500's rapid increase in value. Since dividend yield is a function of price, the S&P 500's rapid ascent and recent all-time highs have worked to push its yield lower. Something tells me this is a trade-off that investors will gladly take. If you want the highest-yielding sector within the S&P 500, look no further than telecom, with companies like AT&T and Verizon leading the way. Telecom companies and content providers do deal with relatively high up-front infrastructure costs, but are mostly protected by high barriers to entry and somewhat minimal competition. The result is telecom companies having exceptional margin power and the ability to lock consumers in with contracts. This is why their dividend yields are so high and why the aggregate sector yield through the third quarter of 2016 was 4.5%, more than double the S&P 500, according to FactSet. On the other hand, consumer discretionary stocks offer the worst yields at 1.4% on aggregate basis as of the third quarter of 2016. Discretionary companies rely on a strong economy to drive dividend growth, but a mixture of weak GDP growth and inflation data, coupled with tepid consumer spending, has kept this from happening in recent years. Image source: Getty Images. Among the veritable sea of dividend-paying companies lies a small clique of elite payers known as Dividend Aristocrats. A Dividend Aristocrat is a publicly traded company that's increased its payout for a minimum of 25 straight years. Just a couple dozen companies have done so, making it a pretty exclusive club. However, at the top of the list are six stocks that have raised their payouts for at least 60 straight years: You'll note that most of these companies supply a basic need, and thus inelastic, good or service, which is why their pricing power remains strong and why they've been able to thrive in both booming and recessionary economies. Apple may be the dividend kingpin in terms of aggregate annual payout, but no public company can rival York Water (NASDAQ:YORW), which has paid an uninterrupted dividend since 1816. This little-known water and sewer utility relies on the fact that water and sewer service are inelastic. If you live in a home, condo, or apartment, you need water and sewer service. Furthermore, York's business is regulated, which means it's not exposed to wholesale pricing fluctuations. The result is a company with exceptionally predictable growth and cash flow and thus a healthy dividend. Image source: Getty Images. Last, but not least, according to data from FactSet, the number of successful activist campaigns within the S&P 500 that were aiming for an increase in shareholders returns via stock buybacks and dividends hit a 10-year low in 2016 (at least through third-quarter 2016). Just 10 of the nearly 40 activist campaigns were successful, which compares to nearly 40 successful campaigns in just over 70 attempts in 2015. It's unclear whether companies are getting better at thwarting the demands of activist investors, or if they're finding more effective uses of capital than shareholder returns at this point. As you can see, dividend stocks can tell a story. What tales might your portfolio have in store? ","

Also see: Sprint executives met with Warren Buffett for an investment in wireless company “We wouldn’t rule [Masayoshi Son] out.

174,Ezequiel Minaya,8032017,MarketWatch,7272017,"Published: Aug 1, 2017 8:23 a.m. ET By Sprint Corp., which recently had its advances seeking a tie-up with cable giant Charter Communications Inc. rebuffed, posted a net profit for the first time in three years amid cost-cutting efforts. Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said Tuesday the profit was ""an important milestone"" that reflects progress in the company's journey to boost its revenue and customer growth and transform its cost structure. Shares in the company, which have risen 30% over the past 12 months, climbed 2.8% to $8.20 in premarket trading. The company said it had 88,000 postpaid phone additions during the quarter, the eighth consecutive period of expansion. However, the pace of growth has slowed from a year ago when the company reported 173,000 postpaid additions. Prepaid additions were 35,000, up from a loss of 306,000 a year ago, but fewer than the 291,000 registered in the March quarter. In all for the June quarter, Sprint posted a profit of $206 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $302 million, or 8 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 4.5% to $8.16 billion. Meanwhile, total net operating expenses also dipped, falling 13.3% to $7 billion. Analysts had expected a loss of a penny a share on $8.11 billion in revenue. Sprint proposed a merger with Charter that would have created a massive new entity controlled by SoftBank Group Corp., Sprint's parent, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. On Sunday, Charter Communications Inc. said it wasn't interested. Sprint had launched exclusive talks with Charter and Comcast Corp. in late May about an array of deal possibilities including one that would allow Comcast and Charter to offer wireless service under their own brands using Sprint's network, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Charter and Comcast, the two largest U.S. cable companies by subscribers, in May agreed to a partnership that barred either company from doing a wireless deal without the other's blessing or participation for a year. Charter would therefore need Comcast's approval for any merger with Sprint. The backdrop of all the discussions is the convergence of the cable and wireless industries as smartphones become increasingly important and consumers rely more equally on cable and wireless companies to surf the web and watch videos. Charter is planning to join in the increasingly competitive wireless phone industry. The company has a mobile virtual network operator pact, or reseller agreement, with Verizon Communications Inc., and a spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that Charter intends to launch wireless services to customers next year.

Read: Apple’s earnings-driven gain puts the Dow on pace to top 22,000 Wall Street remains solidly higher for 2017, with major indexes having hit a series of records. However, the rally has left valuations stretched. “People are saying the move has been overdone, but they’ve been saying that for a while,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. “Valuations do look stretched relative to historical norms, but investors are looking a little farther out, and valuations don’t look that bad in that context.” “Overall, earnings have been coming in good this season, with stocks beating on revenue and profits,” Jacobsen said. “The fact that the market is still reacting to that in a positive way tells me that stocks aren’t in a bubble, that there’s fundamental support.” Read:  How each Dow stock contributed to the 22,000 milestone Apple has been one of the market’s biggest gainers thus far this year, up 36%.

The report is often watched for clues to the strength of official employment data, though the correlation between the ADP figures and government data is weak. Investors are in a holding pattern in advance of the Friday jobs report, said Bill Stone, global chief investment strategist at PNC Management Group. Apple is an outlier Wednesday as many investors were expecting the tech giant to have a tough quarter, Stone said. “Everybody’s waiting for Friday for more indication of what the Fed may do,” Stone said in an interview. Of particular interest will be average hourly wages, Stone said, because if they rise, it would be an indication that inflation may not be as soft as expected, and support the argument for more tightening from the central bank.

Amazon, at $80 billion in sales, accounts for just 1.5%of total U.S. retail sales, which at the end of 2016 were around $5.5 trillion.

Apple’s U.S. market share is about 44%, thus the total smart mobile-phone market in the U.S. is $150 billion a year. Add spending on smartphone accessories (cases, cables, screen protectors, etc.) and we are probably looking at $200 billion total spending annually on smartphones and accessories.

Nokia was king of the dumb phones, with sales in the U.S. in 2006 of $4 billion. The total dumb cellphone handset market in the U.S. in 2006 was probably around $10 billion. Consumer income has not changed much since 2006, which means that over the last 10 years $190 billion in consumer spending has been diverted toward mobile phones. It gets more interesting.

                                   wireless-generated revenue in 2006 was $38 billion. Fast-forward 10 years and it is $89 billion — a $51 billion increase. Verizon’s market share is about 30%, making the total spending increase on wireless services alone close to $150 billion. Between smartphones and their services, $340 billion will not be spent on T-shirts and shoes. But we are not done. The combination of mid-single-digit health-care inflation and the proliferation of high-deductible plans has increased consumer direct health-care costs and further chipped away at discretionary dollars. Health-care spending in the U.S. is $3.3 trillion, and even a 3% rise in costs would be close to $100 billion. Then there are soft, hard-to-quantify factors. Millennials and millennial-want-to-be generations don’t really care about clothes as much as we may have 10 years ago. After all, high-tech billionaires wear hoodies and flip-flops to work. Lack of fashion sense did not hinder their success, so why should the rest of us care about the dress code? In the ‘90s casual Fridays were a big deal — yippee, we could wear jeans to work! Fast-forward 20 years, and every day is casual. Suits? They are worn to job interviews or to impress old-fashioned clients. Consumer habits have slowly changed, and we now put less value on clothes (and thus spend less money on them) and more value on having the latest iThing. All this brings us to a hard and sad reality: The U.S. is over-retailed. We simply have too many stores. Americans have four- or five times more square-footage per capita than other developed countries. This bloated square footage was created for a different consumer, the one who in in the ‘90s and ‘00s was borrowing money against her house and spending it at her local shopping mall. Today’s post-Great Recession consumer is deleveraging, paying off debt, spending money on new necessities such as mobile phones, and paying more for the old ones such as health care. Yes, Amazon and online sales do matter. Ten years ago just 2.5% of retail sales took place online, and today that number is 8.5% — about a $300 billion change. Some of these online sales were captured by brick-and-mortar online sales, some by e-commerce giants like Amazon, and some by brands selling directly to consumers. But as you can see, online sales are just one piece of a complex retail puzzle. All the aforementioned factors combined explain why, when gasoline prices declined by almost 50% (gifting consumers hundreds of dollars of discretionary spending per month), retailers’ profitability and consumer spending did not flinch — those savings were more than absorbed by other expenses. Understanding that online sales (meaning Amazon) are not the only culprit responsible for horrible retail numbers is crucial in the analysis of retail stocks. If you are only asking “Who can best  fight Amazon?” then you are only solving for one variable in a multivariable problem. These are the facts: consumer habits have changed; the U.S. is over-retailed; and consumer spending is being diverted to different parts of the economy. Value investors are naturally attracted to hated sectors. But we demand a much greater margin of safety from retail stocks, because estimating their future cash flows (and thus fair value) is becoming increasingly difficult. Warren Buffett has said that you want to own a business that can be run by an idiot, because one day it will be. A successful retail business in today’s world cannot be run by by an idiot.

177,Austen Hufford,8032017,MarketWatch,7272017,"Published: July 27, 2017 6:12 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp.'s entertainment unit surged in the second quarter, helped by the strong box-office performance of ""The Fate of the Furious,"" lifting profit and revenue even as cable video subscriber losses ticked up. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue rose 17% to $8.33 billion. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division jumped 60%, thanks to the latest installment of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise. The cable networks and broadcast TV units grew revenue and earnings due to increases in subscription fees from pay TV providers, but both also saw a decline in ad sales because of ratings softness. Cable networks' ad revenues declined 0.9% to $906 million, while broadcast TV ad revenue declined 1.2% to $1.27 billion. In the cable business, the company lost 34,000 residential and business video customers, compared with a loss of 4,000 in the same quarter last year. Comcast has generally managed to withstand the turmoil in cable TV from cord-cutting better than some peers in pay television. In a tough environment, with consumers gravitating to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Sling TV, the company has added net video subscribers in five of the past seven quarters. The cord-cutting has taken a toll on TV ratings, however, for NBCUniversal's channels just like those of many other media companies. Comcast and industry analysts point to its investment in X1, a cloud-based, set-top box system, as a reason its video business has held up. The company said that 55% of its residential video customers now have X1, up from nearly 40% in the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast added 175,000 total internet customers in the second quarter, down from 220,000 in the year-earlier period. Total revenue per customer relationship, Comcast's unit revenue figure for its cable division, increased 2.2% to $151.19. Comcast lost 22,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 64,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 61% of revenue, rose 5.5% to $13.12 billion. Comcast recently launched a new wireless service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast, along fellow cable provider Charter Communications Inc., has explored a deal with Sprint Corp. that could provide an alternative reseller arrangement, potentially with better terms, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. In all, net income rose to $2.51 billion, or 52 cents a share, up from about $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue grew 9.8% to $21.17 billion.

178,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"SYDNEY, Aug 4 (IFR) - Verizon Communications (Baa1/BBB+/A–) has reopened Australia’s Kangaroo bond market for global corporate issuers with a stunning four-tranche print that can only encourage further issuance from offshore blue chips. The US telecom giant smashed expectations with a A$2.2 billion ($1.76 billion) four-tranche issue. It is the first Kangaroo bond from a corporate issuer this year and the second-biggest corporate bond in the Australian dollar market, just shy of Apple’s A$2.25 billion three-tranche Kangaroo debut in August 2015. Verizon priced well inside guidance levels and in line with its US dollar curve, said market sources. The A$500 million 5.5-year floating-rate note priced 122 basis points wide of three-month BBSW, 8bp below 130bp area guidance, while the A$550 million 3.5 percent fixed-rated February 2023s priced at asset swaps plus 122bp. The A$450 million 4.05 percent seven-year and A$700m 4.5 percent 10-year notes priced 157bp and 185b over asset swaps, versus respective guidance in the 160bp area and 190bp area. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan were joint lead managers for the trade. Verizon’s jumbo financing again highlights the pent-up demand for corporate credit in Australia’s bank-dominated local market. Local corporate bond sales have jumped to A$8 billion this year versus just A$1.6 billion in same period in 2016 and A$5.1 billion in the whole of last year. Apple revealed the Australian market’s potential as a global funding alternative in 2015 with its inaugural A$2.25 billion four-year and seven-year debut in August 2015 that smashed the previous A$500 million record for corporate Kangaroos. US chipmaker Intel followed with a A$800 million sale of four and seven-year Kangaroos in November 2015. In June 2016, Coca-Cola raised A$1 billion from a four and eight-year issuance, the same month Apple returned with a A$1.425 billion four-year, 7.6-year and 10-year offering. Three other corporate Kangaroos last year raised between A$175 million and A$350 million from single tranche trades. US companies have issued bonds overseas in recent years to avoid high US corporate tax rates levied on repatriated overseas profits. Companies have chosen to keep profits offshore, issuing bonds in foreign currencies and swapping proceeds back to US dollars to help pay dividends and finance stock buybacks. US motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, rated A3/A– (Moody’s/S&P), could follow Verizon having held investor meetings in Australia and Singapore in March for a possible Kangaroo debut. Verizon has had a busy week in the Asian capital markets. It also priced a $950 million 5.15 percent 33-year non-call five Formosa bond in the Taiwanese market. Citigroup and BNP Paribas Taipei were local underwriters while Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were structuring agents on the trade. Verizon is a huge bond issuer with over $116 billion-equivalent in bonds outstanding, the vast majority of which is in US dollars. This total includes $3 billion of 16-year notes sold on Tuesday as part of a liability management exercise to take out a number of high-coupon legacy bonds as well as other short-term debt.

Under the agreement, DirecTV Now will stream CBS, CBS Sports, the CW channel and many of CBS’ local broadcast stations, according to the company. Customers will also have the option to buy a subscription to CBS’ premium Showtime network. AT&T will pay CBS for its content, helping the TV network shift its revenue stream away from advertising as more viewers watch their favorite shows online. Last year, CBS signed similar deals with Hulu and Alphabet Inc’s Google to be included in their streaming video services. Earlier this year, CBS announced a deal with Verizon Communications Inc  to distribute its content. The New York-based broadcaster, which owns the most widely viewed U.S. television network, said much of the programming of the channels under the deal would also be available on-demand. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. “For any bundle to be truly successful, CBS is must-have content,” said Ray Hopkins, head of CBS Corp’s TV networks distribution. ","

Sprint (NYSE:S) is desperately fighting to win new customers from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The fourth-place carrier's most recent attempt to bring in new customers is to offer its unlimited data plan free for a year to customers switching from its competition. That promotion was supposed to end at the end of June, but it's been extended twice now. Even giving away phone service didn't attract enough subscribers to Sprint to offset losses in tablets and connected devices last quarter. Overall, the company lost 39,000 postpaid subscribers -- which are users who pay their bills monthly. Postpaid service revenue fell 6.5% year over year. Sprint's ads now feature ""Paul from Verizon."" Image source: Sprint Last quarter was the first full quarter for Verizon's unlimited data plan, and it paid off with much greater than expected postpaid subscriber additions. Verizon also posted record low postpaid phone churn rate of 0.7%. AT&T also had a solid quarter, posting its best-ever postpaid phone churn of 0.79%. However, it did still lose 89,000 postpaid phone subscribers. Still, that loss is a slowdown from previous periods when it was losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers every quarter. Some of AT&T's success in stemming its losses may be thanks to its decision to offer substantial savings on its TV services for unlimited data plan subscribers, including free HBO for its high-end Unlimited Plus service. T-Mobile, meanwhile, continues to eat up industry subscriber growth. The company added 786,000 postpaid phone subscribers. That number may be somewhat inflated, though, because of the way T-Mobile accounts for its new DIGITS virtual number service. Nonetheless, T-Mobile continues to take the lion's share of postpaid net adds in the industry with its aggressive pricing and promotions. Sprint's only competitive advantage against the competition is its pricing. It has a worse network, worse brand, and no bundling economics to play to its advantage. Offering free service for a year is basically an admission of its inability to compete on those levels. Verizon's results show that consumers are willing to pay up for a top-quality network, and the price is good enough. As a result, Sprint's efforts largely fell on deaf ears. During the company's earnings call, CEO Marcelo Claure said the company has already added 115,000 net new postpaid subscribers in July. (It's unclear if that numbers is phones or all postpaid subscribers.) He says the company is taking share from all of its competitors. More importantly, he doesn't expect AT&T and Verizon to get any more aggressive with their promotions. Meanwhile, Sprint itself has gotten more aggressive with its free service promotion. It's actively advertising the offer on social media to draw in more users and extending the expiration date. But the back end of the year is historically stronger for Sprint than the first half. Those results don't mean much without context. For example, last year, Sprint added 344,000 postpaid subscribers in its fiscal second quarter. Based on its results in July, it's on pace for exactly the same number of net adds this year. While it's a good sign Sprint's growth isn't slowing like it has in the previous four quarters, the period isn't over yet. What's more, if much of that growth is stemming from its free year of service promotion, it's hard to say how good that is for Sprint's long-term results. ","

Shares of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have rebounded since the company reported a solid second quarter in late July, with a strong showing in wireless due to the company's new unlimited plan. Also highlighted was the completion of the Yahoo! acquisition and its combination with AOL under the new Oath media business subsidiary. That business is generating $7 billion a year in revenue, and Verizon expects to reap $1 billion in operating expenses from Oath through 2020. While Verizon investors rightfully focus their attention each quarter on wireless results, the company is doing exciting work on less noticeable IoT and 5G network business development. Image source: Getty. Over the last couple of years, Verizon has made a number of Internet of Things (IoT) acquisitions -- smaller but important purchases that have mostly flown under the radar. You can read about those in more detail here. The company offers little in the way of specifics on the performance of its spending spree, other than it has an IoT division. However, the company said in its recent quarterly earnings report and on the quarterly conference call with analysts that organic IoT revenue, including telematics, grew about 20% year-over-year. The recently acquired telematics business – which is comprised of connected vehicle and fleet tracking and management services – brought in $220 million in the second quarter. No one really knows what the total market will eventually be for the IoT, but an estimate from Gartner says that the number of global connected devices will exceed 20 billion by the year 2020. That compares with an estimated 8.4 billion or so in operation this year. That's a big market, and someone will need to provide a network on which all of those devices communicate. This offers an important avenue of growth for Verizon, which saw revenue drop 2% in the quarter, excluding divestitures and acquisitions. It reported total consolidated operating revenue of $30.5 billion. The IoT business could eventually be a catalyst for big growth. Image source: Verizon. Closely linked to the IoT business is the development of 5G, a next-generation wireless network that will boast faster speeds and less latency than the current 4G LTE. More importantly, though, 5G will be able to power advanced connected machines like autonomous vehicles and devices used in offering remote healthcare. Verizon has been working to be the first to roll out the next-gen network, including outbidding AT&T (NYSE: T) for 5G technology and patent holding company Straight Path Communications for $3.1 billion. 2017 is a big year, as initial 5G testing in eight urban markets is underway. On the conference call, management was short on details here and said to wait for more information later this year when results from the testing is released. Testing involves an initial batch of customers that Verizon is using as guinea pigs to learn how to roll out 5G for general commercial use. With Verizon's current 4G-centric wireless business making up about three-fourths of revenue, it will continue to be the driving force behind business and share price performance. However, the current iteration of telecom technology is mostly played out as far as growth goes, leaving telecom businesses fighting over the existing client base in the U.S. While still small and in early development phase, Verizon's IoT and 5G units do little to impact quarterly results. However, as the world gets increasingly connected, these segments stand to grow and have the potential to pull Verizon out of its current fight for mobile phone subscribers. ","

When it cones to delivering a product people like, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) have done a surprisingly good job of keeping people happy, according to a new report from J.D. Power. Sprint (NYSE:S) doesn't score quite as well as its rivals, but all four companies run the risk of losing customers if those users actually need to interact with their carriers. That general customer content (albeit to a much-lower extent with Sprint) bodes well for the major wireless carriers. Poor customer service when something goes wrong could cause that satisfaction to disappear, J.D. Power found it its 2017 U.S. Wireless Customer Care Full-Service Performance Study -- Volume 2. ""A fast resolution to a problem -- whether companies try to solve it in-store, online, or through social media -- is the best way to both avoid customers' ire and curb their temptation of switching providers,"" wrote the consumer insights, advisory services, and data and analytics company. ""This means reducing wait times, training staff to be skilled and knowledgeable, and solving the problem on the first try are issues of paramount importance."" Data from the study noted that there is considerable room for improvement in customer-service related areas. Consumers were specifically upset about the level of effort it takes to get the help they needed. T-Mobile has worked to improve its network. Image source: T-Mobile. Verizon, which recently scored a win on the twice-annual RootMetrics Mobile Performance in the United States report, also took first place here, scoring a 797 out of 900. AT&T came in second with a 796, with T-Mobile just behind at 795. Sprint brought up the rear, scoring a 723. The top three carriers all rated five ""Power Circles,"" which marks them as ""among the best,"" while Sprint scored two, ranking it with ""the rest."" J.D. Power surveyed 9,994 customers who contacted their carrier's customer-care department within the past three months to compile the two studies. In both cases, the research was done from January through June 2017. When things go well, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile enjoy a positive relationship with their customers. People who ""strongly agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" that it takes a lot of effort to speak with a live representative saw satisfaction drop by 210 points compared with those who ""strongly disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that it takes a lot of effort (642 vs. 852, respectively). In addition, how long customers spent on hold and whether their carrier solved their issue on the first try greatly affected satisfaction. ""The first-contact resolution rate is 85% among those who strongly or somewhat disagreed that it required a lot of effort to resolve their most recent issue, compared with only 31% among those who strongly or somewhat agreed,"" according to J.D. Power. The studies also found that while only 5% of customers used social media to resolve issues, those who do have higher satisfaction levels (841 versus 792). In general, people would prefer to solve their issues over the phone. More than half (56%) of those surveyed said that resolving a problem online requires a lot of effort, similar to the 54% who feel that about in-store help. Only 49% of respondents felt that way about trying to solve their problems over the phone. ""Nobody wants to spend a lot of time trying to deal with an issue they shouldn't have had in the first place,"" said J.D. Power's Peter Cunningham. ""Customers believe carriers have a ways to go when it comes to reducing the amount of effort involved in problem resolution. But if carriers focus on it, they will likely see churn decrease and profits increase."" The top three carriers clearly have a good enough product that many customers never encounter a problem. The breaking point for the industry comes when something goes wrong. That leads to possible frustration in getting a quick resolution and the possibility that the consumer will switch carriers. ""With wireless providers getting so competitive about pricing, coupled with the migration from the two-year contract, there are too many options for customers to stay in bad wireless relationships,"" Cunningham said. Basically, the best way for any carrier -- but most specifically Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile -- to hold on to customers is for them to improve customer service. That seems like a relatively easy fix, though it's one on which the industry has perhaps neglected to spend money in favor of other areas, including improving their networks. ","

T-Mobile is back with a plan for slightly older phone users. Over the last several years, T-Mobile has refashioned itself into the rebel ""un-carrier"" catering to a younger, hipper crowd. Now, it's going after their parents and grandparents. The nation's third-largest carrier on Monday introduced a new rate plan specifically marketed at consumers who are 55 and older. The plan, which includes unlimited data, calls and text messages, costs $50 a month for an individual line and $60 for a couple. Like other T-Mobile One plans, the rates include the taxes and fees. The normal price is $70 for a single line, and $120 for two lines (although there's currently a limited promotion that brings it down to $100). Customers will be able to sign up for the new plan starting Wednesday. The program, coined T-Mobile One Unlimited 55+, marks a departure from the usual wireless promotions that go after younger customers or families. It's another sign of the broader move by the carriers to offer more incentives to people to stick around or switch to their service. In this case, it's targeting a segment that hasn't gotten a lot of love. ""We're bringing the un-carrier revolution to people who are underserved and overpriced,"" Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Sherrard said in an interview Friday ahead of the news. Sherrard said the push to go beyond younger consumers in big markets comes from T-Mobile's expansion of its wireless network into areas outside of major cities. ""We've done phenomenally well with millennials and in urban centers,"" Sherrard said. ""Now we have an amazing opportunity to move beyond that."" He noted that the older age demographic represents the fastest-growing group of smartphone adopters and users. The new rate includes a discount for enrolling in its auto-pay function.

While retailers in both the digital and physical world have seemingly become obsessed with reaching millennial shoppers, older generations still have a lot of purchasing power. In fact, Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980, has the highest annual spending per American household, averaging $66,981, while millennials, defined for this info as those born 1981 through now, come in third at $47,114, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) blog. Baby boomers, people born between 1946 and 1964, have the second most at $59,646. With the youngest boomer now 53, most of that age group has crossed the 55+ mark, a group being targeted by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in a new promotion. The wireless carrier has essentially created a senior discount for people 55 and older, a group it says it has a less than 10% share of currently. T-Mobile wants a bigger share of customers over 55. Image source: T-Mobile. The Un-carrier, as it calls itself, has offered the more than 93 million Americans that are 55 and over, two lines with unlimited data, calls, and text for $60 per month, including all taxes and fees. (It's $50 for the first line and $10 for the second. Only the first person needs to be 55 or older.) That's $40 cheaper than the $100 the company charges younger customers for the same plan. The offer starts Aug. 9 and it requires customers to use autopay to get the deal price. T-Mobile CEO John Legere touted the offer as a different way to market to baby boomers, and members of the silent generation (born 1929-1945). Getting the deal requires that new customers visit a T-Mobile store to actually show their ID. Existing customers in the impacted age group can switch pricing by calling the carrier or visiting a store. Legere is right when he notes that the deals being offered to seniors don't reflect how many of them use their phones. Yes, there's a much-older audience that wants very limited handsets with big buttons, but that's not what most Americans over age 55 want. According to T-Mobile: A senior discount has worked well in a number of industries. The wireless company is not requiring 55+ customers to do anything different to get the deal. This is not an early bird special or a movie deal for going to see a film when younger people are working or at school, it's the regular T-Mobile One Unlimited plan at a better price. Legere's company just surpassed Verizon (NYSE: VZ) for first place on one of the two major wireless studies. The results of that report suggest that T-Mobile can make inroads in a market dominated by Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T). T-Mobile makes that very clear in its press release, saying that those two companies control nearly 81% of the postpaid wireless market of people 55 and older while T-Mobile only has 8%. ""When these generations were getting their first phones, AT&T and Verizon were the only real options -- and the Duopoly has been taking advantage of them ever since!"" said Legere. Basically T-Mobile feels it can now prove it has a good enough network to go after an audience that has been very conservative, opting for the traditional leaders. By offering aggressive pricing coupled with its new status as the top network (though a second major study disagrees), Legere believes that his company can take share from AT&T and Verizon. There's no reason to expect this deal won't work. ","

Altaba is primarily comprised of the non-core foreign assets that were formerly part of Yahoo!, an IP patent portfolio that is called Excalibur, and the cash it received for selling YAHOO!'s core business to Verizon plus cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities it already had on its books. It also has some debt on its books in the form of convertible notes. Image source: Getty images. Altaba was created to maximize shareholder profits and efficiently return cash to shareholders. To do so, the company will try to figure out a tax-efficient strategy to sell its assets and return its cash to stockholders. This is easier said than done due to complex federal and state tax regulations that would take as much as 36.5% of its profits from the sale of foreign assets if they were sold and the cash repatriated back to the United States. Altaba owns shares of two foreign businesses. It owns approximately 36% of Yahoo Japan and approximately 15% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). This table shows the number of shares that Altaba owns and the value of those holdings. Data source: Altaba. The company has a cost basis, or what it paid for both investments, of $5.9 billion. This is a great demonstration of how much money can be made when shares are held long term, as profits on the holdings are over $54 billion. These two holdings comprise the bulk of the value of Altaba. Altaba has stated it had a tax liability of almost $15 billion in its latest proxy statement based on the closing prices for the two stocks as of the end of 2016. Today, that number is even higher based on share prices gains. Altaba also owns minority interests in a variety of other companies, including Hortonworks  and SNAP. These minority stock holdings are relatively small -- about $130 million in value -- in comparison to its holdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, which combined are worth more than $60 billion. The patent portfolio, Excalibur, is listed on Alibaba's books as being worth $740 million. All the company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are worth approximately $12 billion. Add up all of Altaba's holdings, and the company is worth roughly $85 per share on a pre-tax basis. The shares trade for over a 30% discount to the pre-tax price, as the market needs to price in the tax burden facing the business. But, investors are hoping management can figure out how to minimize taxes, which would give shares a lift. As share prices change daily, the company has created an almost real-time display of its pre-tax share price and its actual share price that is available at its website. For now, investors will continue to hope that management can find the most tax-efficient method to get cash out of the company and into shareholders' pockets. ","
      
    Understanding Altaba: Why Its Holdings Are Discounted by 30% -- The Motley Fool

187,Nicholas Rossolillo,8102017,Fool,8032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the last few months, the stock of global satellite telecom company Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) has been rallying strongly. However, while sales notched a 12% increase in the just-reported second quarter of the year, there was still a $12.5 million loss from operations. Speculation seems to be in the driver's seat here, and investors should be careful. GSAT data by YCharts In the second quarter of 2017, Globalstar revenue increased 12% to $28.1 million, compared to $25.1 million last year. That is good news for the company, as revenue has been steadily rising now since 2010, when it began updating its current satellite array. GSAT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The top line is improving, but it is profit margins that are the concerning part here. Globalstar still hasn't reached scale, as the company loses money on operations. In the second quarter, the loss was $12.5 million and $98.7 million on operations and on a net basis, respectively. Free cash flow, or cash left over after operations are paid for, has also remained negative for years. GSAT Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts To hit breakeven, the company still needs to generate significantly more revenue. While the company is making headway in that regard, last quarter's year-over-year increase still puts breakeven several years out assuming that number holds. However, the trend is positive, and that has led some to speculate that the satellite company could be a takeover target. Since I last wrote about Globalstar a few months ago, the stock has rallied as much as 30%. Little has changed, but investor interest has been driven by speculation that the company could be purchased for its telecom assets. Perhaps fueling the fire was Verizon's (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T's (NYSE: T) bidding war over Straightpath Communications (NYSEMKT: STRP) back in May. Globalstar was recently awarded approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use its satellites as a network extension for land-based wireless 4G LTE providers. The company is looking for a partner to help monetize that approval, but the fact that it was given the nod from the FCC has led some to think a Globalstar bidding war like the one for Straightpath could ensue. Image source: Globalstar. What many speculators may have missed, though, is that Globalstar already has a savior: Thermo Companies, whose CEO is Globalstar CEO James Monroe. Thermo owns over half of Globalstar shares and most of its debt, putting the small satellite provider squarely in its control. While that type of insider ownership could be a good thing, in this case it could create a conflict of interest that hurts other shareholders. Bleeding cash, Globalstar has been relying on the issuance of new shares to keep it afloat, and the primary buyer has been Thermo. That boosts Thermo's ownership, but dilutes the value of shares for everyone else. That also means that a possible sale of the company will be up to Thermo to decide on, not other investors, and it might not favor a buyout unless the offer is significantly higher than its average cost per share. What's best for the goose (shareholders) may not be best for the gander (Thermo). Globalstar has valuable assets in its global satellite telecom service, recently approved for ground LTE use in the U.S. and is currently seeking approval in other countries as well. Revenues are on the rise, although the new capabilities of its satellites for on-the-ground telecom in the U.S. have yet to be unlocked. However, even with revenues on the rise, the company is still a long way off from profitability and relies on its insiders to stay afloat. That situation dilutes ownership for everyone else and over time lowers the value of shares. At this point, any significant rise in the stock is likely to be rooted in speculation. Long-term investors should tread lightly. ","

188,Matthew Cochrane,8102017,Fool,8032017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) recently reported its second quarter earnings and even a cursory glance at the results show healthy growth in nearly every meaningful metric. The company's core sales increased to $2.6 billion, a 6% increase year over year, and its core EPS increased to $0.42, a 14% increase over 2016's second quarter. While the stock price immediately dipped after Corning reported earnings, long term, buy-and-hold investors know to focus on a business's underlying fundamentals, not short term price volatility. Besides, shares are still up more than 20% year-to-date. Like last quarter, Corning's two fastest growing divisions boosted the company's growth. Corning's Specialty Materials division, responsible for manufacturing Gorilla Glass, saw sales increase to $337 million, a 27% increase year-over-year. The company's Optical Communications division, which supplies optical fiber solutions to telecom carriers and internet service providers, saw core earnings rise 26% over last year's second quarter results. Data source: Corning Inc. Many quarterly highlights were discussed during the conference call, including the major deal it recently scored with Verizon and Apple's major investment in Corning's Gorilla Glass manufacturing capacity. What might excite investors most, though, is a completely new opportunity Corning is looking to exploit: glass pharmaceutical packaging. Granted, it doesn't sound sexy or exciting, but the market could be as big as $4 billion in annual sales and could lift Corning's companywide margins in the process. The new pharmaceutical packaging is being called Corning Valor Glass and, according to CEO Wendell Weeks, it ""dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks, and cracks while significantly increasing throughput."" The delicate and precise nature of medicine requires strong quality control and recent problems in pharmaceutical packaging have led the FDA to issue warnings on ""lamella"" -- the tiny flakes of glass that can contaminate pharmaceutical products. Valor Glass is designed to eliminate these problems. Most encouraging for investors during the conference call was to hear Weeks tout two meaningful endorsements of the products from some of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest players. Merck and Co., Inc.'s CEO Ken Frazier said that his company ""plans to convert several injectable products to this exceptional new glass packaging solution pending appropriate regulatory approvals."" Pfizer Inc's CEO Ian Read went even further, calling his company's collaboration with Corning a ""game changer."" After quoting these two endorsements, Weeks concluded: Valor also provides a powerful example of what happens when our focused and cohesive portfolio meets a customer opportunity. We started out with major customers from our life science vessels platform. We reapplied our expertise in glass science, optical physics, vapor deposition, precision forming and extrusion to develop a breakthrough product that we believe has the potential to power Corning's growth for the next decade and beyond. Corning scientists have developed a new glass product for pharmaceutical packaging called ""Valor Glass"". Image source: Corning Inc. Corning's management said it plans to start with a relatively small investment of $500 million but that, over time, investments in Valor Glass could rise to as much as $4 billion depending on customer demand. Investments in the platform have already been calculated in management's guidance. The best news might be that Corning predicts ongoing annual sales for this platform will equal the platform's one-time start-up investment costs with profitability exceeding the company's average. As for when this product will be able to see the light of the market, a lot depends on the FDA, which can decide to accelerate Valor Glass's approval, allowing it to reach the market more rapidly than it otherwise would. For this reason, Corning believes it will be able to paint a better picture of the road map ahead once the product is officially submitted for approval. The positive side to the highly regulated FDA approval process is that it gives advance notice to Corning of market demand, significantly de-risking its initial investments into the space. As already noted, Corning's stock price declined by about 8% since reporting its second quarter earnings. Why? Probably because it gave conservative guidance for its Optical Communications division after admitting earnings for the division might be lumpy due to the inherent difficulty in planning for major infrastructure projects by large telecom and internet service provider companies. Yet, in the same release, Corning also announced plans to launch its new Valor Glass platform which could potentially boost company sales by 40% per year all by itself. As an investor, which one of these facts do you think is more material to Corning's long term success? Remember, the market rewards those with a long-term horizon who are savvy enough to exploit short term volatility. While there are never any guarantees, this certainly looks like such an opportunity.

Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) reported second-quarter 2017 results after the market closed on Wednesday. Here's how the quarter worked out for the data center operator and global interconnection specialist, which is organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $1,066 million $900.5 million 18% Operating income $184.9 million Net income $45.8 million $44.7 million Earnings per share $0.58 Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)* $360.1 million $290.5 million 24% AFFO per share $4.59 $4.13 11% Data source: Equinix. *AFFO is a closely watched metric for companies organized as REITs, as it's a driver of payouts to shareholders. It's akin to ""earnings"" for REITs. Revenue increased 11% on a normalized -- which excludes the revenue contribution from acquisitions -- and constant-currency basis. Equinix's revenue came in at about the midpoint of its guidance range of $976 million to $982 million, which didn't include revenue from acquisitions. The company doesn't provide quarterly AFFO guidance. Image source: Getty Images. Here's what CEO Steve Smith had to say in the press release about the quarter: Q2 was another strong quarter for Equinix, surpassing the milestone of $1 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time in the company's history. A key highlight in the quarter was the completion of Verizon's Americas data center portfolio, strengthening our global market leadership and providing additional capability to meet customer demand. As the shift to digital impacts businesses across all segments, private, secure and distributed interconnection continues to grow as a core design principle of IT, resulting in key new customer wins, and healthy and growing market share for Equinix. Equinix provided third-quarter guidance and adjusted its full-year 2017 guidance to include the expected contributions from the Verizon data centers. For the third quarter, the company expects revenue in the range of $1,133 million to $1,141 million, which at the midpoint represents growth of 7% and constant-currency growth of 3% over the year-ago quarter. Equinix does not issue quarterly AFFO guidance. Updated full-year guidance is as follows: Metric Updated 2017 Guidance Previous 2017 Guidance Projected Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $4,317 million to $4,327 million Greater than $3,976 million 20% (more than 11% on normalized and constant-currency basis) AFFO $1,382 million to $1,392 million Greater than $1,214 million 29% (13% on a normalized and constantcurrency basis) Data source: Equinix. AFFO outlook assumes $52 million of integration costs for acquisitions. ","

The bar was lowered after CEO Tim Cook in May conceded there’d been a “pause” in iPhone sales amid heavy promotion for a 10th-anniversary model scheduled for September. The earnings report overall was soothing enough to send shares to record highs this week, striking an intraday high of $159.75 the day after the earnings release and closing at an all-time best $157.14 that day. Analysts said guidance within the earnings release boosted market expectations that new iPhone hardware would emerge in September. That followed recent reports that a high-end iPhone rumored for release this year had hit production problems that would keep it from reaching prospective buyers before Apple’s fiscal year wraps at the end of September.

192,,8172017,Reuters,8102017,"The companies filed a 44-page brief with the court on Monday night in a high-profile dispute over whether police should have to get a warrant before obtaining data that could reveal a cellphone user’s whereabouts. “That users rely on technology companies to process their data for limited purposes does not mean that they expect their intimate data to be monitored by the government without a warrant,” the brief said. The justices agreed last June to hear an appeal by Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted in 2013 in a series of armed robberies of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Ohio and Michigan. Federal prosecutors helped place him near several of the robberies using “cell site location information” obtained from his wireless carrier. Carpenter claims that without a warrant from a court, such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. But last year a federal appeals court upheld his convictions, finding that no warrant was required. Carpenter’s case will be argued before the court some time after its new term begins in October. The case comes amid growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies and concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and police evading warrant requirements. Nathan Freed Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Carpenter, said the companies’ brief represented a “robust defense of their customers’ privacy rights in the digital age.” Verizon’s participation in the brief was important, he added, given that it receives, like other wireless carriers, thousands of requests for cellphone location records every year from law enforcement. The requests are routinely granted. The U.S. Department of Justice, which is defending current law enforcement procedures in the case, declined to comment on Tuesday. Civil liberties lawyers have said police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, to avoid constitutionally unreasonable searches. In their brief, the companies said the Supreme Court should clarify that when it comes to digital data that can reveal personal information, people should not lose protections against government intrusion “simply by choosing to use those technologies.” ","

You already know Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is a huge cash machine. The all-American telecommunications company generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and $45 billion in EBITDA profits over the last four quarters, culled from a $123 billion revenue stream. But do you know exactly how all of these dollars are being herded into Verizon's coffers? Let's review. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon structures its financial results under two operating segments: As you might have guessed after seeing the lopsided subscriber balance between Verizon's two divisions, the wireless and wireline segments provide wildly different contributions to Big Red's financial results: Business Segment Q2 2017 Revenue Revenue Growth (YOY) Q2 2017 Operating Income Wireless $21.3 billion (1.9%) $7.4 billion Wireline $7.8 billion 1.2% $68 million Data source: Verizon SEC filings. YOY = year over year. Of course, this is just a snapshot of a large company constantly changing its business mix and future plans. In 2016, Verizon sold its wireline operations in Texas, California, and Florida to smaller telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). The move reduced Verizon's Fios services and and landline phone footprint by roughly 25%. This was probably a wise move, judging by the way Fios subscribers have been slipping away under Frontier's management. Not even high-quality wireline services are an easy sell these days. On the wireless side, the rampant two-stage growth of ubiquitous cellphone adoption and then smartphones for everyone has essentially stopped. Verizon's retail subscriber count increased by 1.2% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. At the same time, average revenue per contract customer fell by 7%. Nothing comes easy these days for Verizon -- the wireless market is getting saturated and price-sensitive. So the company is branching out in new directions. Verizon has tried its hand at several media publishing operations in recent years, including the high-priced acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!. A streaming video service partnership with Redbox was killed in its infancy, but Big Red is planning another streaming video launch later this year. The wireless business should get a second wind as Verizon rolls out a next-generation 5G network over the next several years, paired with exploding demand for connections related to the Internet of Things. The Verizon we'll see in 10 years should look very different from the business under that name today. But now you know how Verizon is making money in 2017, at least.

197,Keith Speights,8172017,Fool,8102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money."" Whether or not the late U.S. senator from Illinois Everett Dirksen actually every said those exact words, the sentiment is undeniable. Billions of dollars certainly qualify as real money by anyone's definition. Many top companies give plenty of real money back to their shareholders in the form of dividends. Five of the biggest dividend payers are ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Each of these stocks pays out over $8 billion each year in the form of dividends. Are these smart dividend stocks for investors right now? Image source: Getty Images. The biggest oil company in the world is also one of the biggest dividend payers. In 2016, ExxonMobil returned nearly $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. So far this year, the company has paid out more than $6.4 billion in dividends. ExxonMobil's dividend yield currently stands at 3.84%. The company has increased its dividend for 34 consecutive years. Can that streak continue? Probably so. Granted, ExxonMobil has been spending more to cover its dividend than it's make on the bottom line lately. However, the big oil company's massive cash flow should allow it to keep those dividend checks flowing for a long time to come. Smaller players in the oil and gas industry could be shaken out if oil prices dropped too much, but ExxonMobil has weathered plenty of tough times in the past and is well positioned to do so in the future. Telecommunications giant AT&T paid out nearly $11.8 billion in dividends last year. The company returned a little over $6 billion in the first six months of 2017. A&T's shareholders currently enjoy a dividend yield of 5.1%. Like ExxonMobil, the company is a member of the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Aristocrats. To make this list, a record of 25 consecutive years of dividend increases is required. AT&T has hiked its dividend 32 years in a row. Although AT&T uses a higher portion of its earnings to fund the dividend program than is ideal, the company should be in good shape to keep its solid history of dividend increases going. AT&T's cash flow remains very strong. The company could also get a boost from its planned acquisition of Time Warner. Another large telecommunications company is also a great dividend stock. Verizon Communications returned $9.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2016. So far in 2017, the company has paid out $4.7 billion in dividends. Verizon's current dividend yield of 4.72% looks quite attractive. The company doesn't have as impressive a track record of dividend increases as AT&T, however. Still, Verizon has upped its dividend payout for each of the past 10 years. Its payout ratio is less than 60%, which indicates flexibility for continued dividend hikes in the future. The wireless industry is super competitive. However, Verizon has staying power. The company's good second-quarter performance shows that it can make the changes needed to survive and thrive. Industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE) paid $8.5 billion in dividends during 2016. In the first half of this year, the company paid $4.3 billion in dividends. GE's dividend currently yields 3.72%. Although the company claimed an impressive streak of dividend increases in the past few decades, GE cut its dividend in 2009. GE had a few years of dividend hikes after then, but held its dividend payout steady from 2015 to 2016. Incoming CEO John Flannery will no doubt have his hands full. GE's last quarter was a big disappointment. Still, though, dividend-seeking investors shouldn't have significant reasons to worry. GE's cash flow remains solid. The company should be able to keep the dividends coming at least at current levels. Johnson & Johnson returned more than $8.6 billion to shareholders as dividends last year. So far in 2017, the healthcare giant has paid out $4.4 billion in dividends. J&J's dividend yield stands at 2.52%. While that's the lowest of the five dividend stocks on our list, the company has by far the best track record of dividend hikes. J&J has increased its dividend for a remarkable 54 consecutive years. I expect that streak to continue for a long time to come. J&J's cash flow is exceptionally strong. The company also boasts one of the best pipelines in big pharma despite a recent setback with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommending against approval of experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $8 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

198, ,8172017,Fool,8102017,"RootMetrics has come out with yet another report. This time instead of pitting each of the four US carriers against each other, it puts all of the metro areas in the nation against each other. And the top five markets might be a bit surprising to some. The market with the best overall mobile network is Lansing, Michigan, who actually has the 117th largest population in the nation. Lansing had an overall score of 98.5. That was followed by Indianapolis who had a score of 98.3, Modesto, California with a score of 98.2, Chicago, Illinois and Port St. Lucie, Florida which were tied for fourth place with a 98 score. It's important to talk about how RootMetrics ranks these metro areas. RootMetrics went to the top 125 most populated metro markets over the course of the first 6 months of 2017. And it tested network reliability, network speed, data speed, calls and texts, which all made up the overall performance score. The scores are based on an average taken from its tests on all four major US carriers - AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. Each of these networks are weighted by the percentage of customers it has in that metro market. For instance, if New York City has more Verizon customers than Sprint does, then Verizon's score would factor more into the overall score for the city than Sprint, AT&T or T-Mobile's would. Throughout its testing, RootMetrics found that bigger doesn't necessarily mean a better network. Out of the top 5 largest markets, only one of them were in the five best markets for mobile networks, which was Chicago, and it was tied for fourth. The two largest cities, New York City and Los Angeles respectively, ranked 74th and 77th out of 125, respectively. Which is pretty low, actually. The good thing here is that all 125 metro areas did get a score above 90, which means these mobile networks are actually fairly decent. While they may not be perfect in each of the 125 metro markets, they do offer some pretty good service. You can check out the full list from RootMetrics latest report by following the link in the source section below, and you can see where your city landed on the list.

199,Daniel B. Kline,8172017,Fool,8102017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big wireless, or more clearly biggest wireless, has a problem. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) used to market their more-expensive services on the fact that they offered better networks. That's no longer clearly the case. Of the two widely accepted industry studies on the subject, one from RootMetrics shows the gap narrowing between the four major carriers. The second study, from OpenSignal, puts T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in the lead. In reality ""best network"" can mean different things to different people. It depends a lot on where you live, where you travel, and how you use your phone. The one truth, and it's something Sprint (NYSE:S) has been pushing in its ads, is that all networks are now pretty much the same. Sprint has been using Verizon's former pitchman Paul Marcarelli to tout that all networks are pretty much the same. Image source: Sprint. People will pay more for better service. History has shown that customers will actually pay more for even the perception of better service. AT&T and Verizon used to actually have superior networks to T-Mobile and Sprint, but now they mostly only have the perception of being better. That's an image that has been fading as both low-cost carriers have been heavily marketing the idea that network quality is no longer a differentiating factor. As this idea becomes more accepted, one of two things, or perhaps both, will happen to AT&T and Verizon. They will either lose customers, lower prices, or suffer some combination of the two. It's nearly impossible to believe that consumers will pay higher prices for roughly the same thing once they understand that's what they are doing. All prices are as of 8/14/17 and subject to change. As you can see in the chart above, Sprint has the best deal (though it's a promotion that could end) while Verizon charges the most. T-Mobile's prices are actually lower than they appear because the company includes taxes and fees in its base price. Verizon and AT&T were forced by T-Mobile and Sprint into offering unlimited data plans costing them billions in overage charges. That pressure is going to increase as T-Mobile continues building a reputation as having the best combination of network and price while Sprint uses extreme discounting to win customers. T-Mobile has 17 straight quarters where it has added more than 1 million customers. Sprint has turned a corner and reported positive income for the first time in three years in Q1 and it has the stock price upside that the company is very much available for sale or merger. That could mean a merger with T-Mobile, or another buyer, but either scenario likely means bad news for AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile have the most upside in the wireless industry because they have built their business on what matters to consumers now. AT&T and Verizon built theirs on a network quality advantage that has either eroded greatly or no longer exists. That's going to lead to more pain for both companies as they adjust to a changed market, and T-Mobile and Sprint should profit from that pain. ","

Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) recently reported second-quarter results: GAAP earnings sunk deep into the red due to the satellite communications specialist's skyrocketing share prices. Nice problem to have, right? Here's what you need to know about its latest business update. Metric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $28.1 million $25.1 million 12% Operating Income (Loss) ($12.5 million) ($16.4 million) N/A Net Income (Loss) ($98.7 million) $14.1 million N/A Adjusted EBITDA $8.2 million $5.1 million 61% Data source: Globalstar. Globalstar's bottom-line income swung from a $14 million profit to a $99 million loss due to large fluctuations in the company's portfolio of derivatives. Its debt portfolio includes many contracts that have derivative features, tying the value of the debt to the company's stock price, among other metrics. Share prices have gained 73% year-to-date as of Aug. 14, and those rising share prices triggered higher debt valuations, so Globalstar recorded a $77 million non-cash expense to account for this balance sheet update. A year earlier, share prices had been falling, and management recorded a $40 million non-cash gain on the same line. You win some, you lose some. The company's sales rose in some product categories, but fell in others. The biggest gains came from Globalstar's Duplex line of low-speed satellite telephony services and its SPOT anti-theft location tracking tool. Sales of both services rose by double-digit percentages to deliver 85% of total service revenues. But Spot and Duplex will likely be largely forgotten in a year or two, after Globalstar rolls out a new technology platform. Image source: Getty Images. The company has been planning a terrestrial network for years now, repurposing its satellite-grade radio spectrum licenses to deliver services from ground-based cell towers and small cell stations. Globalstar isn't planning a brand new wireless network to compete with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), but more of a partnership approach. On the Q2 earnings call,  CEO Jay Monroe said that he is busy talking to potential partners who are already part of the wireless industry, offering them a new way to boost network speeds with the help of his company's spectrum licenses. ""In order to take best advantage in unlocked considerable value we've built up in Globalstar, from our U.S. spectrum, our international spectrum and our satellite network, we are in partnership discussions with numerous companies,"" Monroe said. Specifically, Globalstar's licenses and technologies are great for small-cell installations that serve up high-speed connections in a tight footprint. All of the major telecoms already make use of small-cell hubs, managed by the same companies that operate cell towers across the nation. Globalstar also aims to tap into the coming 5G wireless technology platform, increasing the speed and reliability of its small-cell connections many times over. I wouldn't be surprised to see American telecoms signing up for lots these service-boosting tools. It's also possible that Globalstar could emerge as a buyout target if one of the majors decides it wants this asset all to itself. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has rallied from one-month lows, and returned to the range. Near-term support (2,463) is followed by a firmer floor matching the former breakout point (2,453). The S&P’s nearly immediate reversal higher is technically constructive. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has maintained near-term support. Specifically, the index has notched consecutive session lows just above the 21,840 floor, detailed last week. Conversely, near-term overhead closely matches the 22,000 mark, and a retest is underway. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq has rallied respectably from one-month lows. In the process, it’s reached familiar resistance — the 6,342-to-6,344 inflection point — an area also illustrated below. The Nasdaq closed Monday at 6,340, and the retest remains underway. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed to the 6,342 resistance from one-month lows. To reiterate, Monday’s close registered just two points lower. Separately, the Nasdaq’s primary uptrend has apparently absorbed its latest whipsaw under the 50-day moving average, currently 6,273. The prevailing series of “higher highs” and “higher lows” signals an uptrend. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark’s backdrop remains the strongest. As illustrated, the August downturn has been underpinned by 21,840 support — illustrated on the hourly chart — an area closely matching the 20-day moving average. The 20-day moving average is a widely-tracked near-term trending indicator, and the Dow’s sustained summer posture higher signals a strong uptrend. Similarly, the S&P 500’s bull trend has absorbed the August downdraft. Tactically, an inflection point spans from 2,449 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average (in blue) and the June peak. To reiterate, the S&P’s nearly immediate reversal to the former range is technically constructive. Though the bigger-picture technicals remain bullish, the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has staged a garden-variety pullback, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have thus far weathered more aggressive August downturns. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has narrowly maintained the 200-day moving average, currently 136.46. Last week’s close (136.47) registered fractionally higher, and the small-cap benchmark has extended its rally attempt this week. Tactically, resistance matches the breakdown point (138.85), detailed previously, and a retest is underway. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has bottomed slightly atop the 200-day moving average, and rallied from two-month lows. Consider that the 200-day moving average is in play partly as a product of the mid-cap benchmark’s prolonged eight-month range. The sideways price action moves the average price of the prior 200 days closer to the current price. Still, the 200-day is a widely-tracked primary trending indicator, and the quality of the prevailing rally attempt is worth tracking. An eventual violation would likely raise a technical caution flag.

                                    remains comparably stronger. Familiar levels stand out: The SPY has reversed firmly atop resistance, preserving a bullish intermediate-term technical bias. Collectively, technical divergences have surfaced this month. The prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. The small- and mid-cap benchmarks remain comparably softer, though each has maintained the 200-day moving average, rising from two-month lows. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ pullback has been garden-variety, while the Nasdaq Composite’s bull trend trend has likely absorbed a respectable August downdraft. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. The nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 area — closely matching the 50-day moving average and the June peak — places the index on firmer technical ground. This area remains an inflection point, though the S&P 500’s intermediate-term bias remains bullish pending a more technically damaging downturn.

To start, the shares have asserted a range-bound, or trendless, six-month backdrop. The flatlining major moving averages bisect the range, exemplifying the absence of trend. Still, the shares have challenged the range top, and the retest is worth tracking. Major resistance is frequently cleared on the third of fourth test. More broadly, the shares have cleared a one-year downtrend illustrated on the two-year chart. The trendline, circa 120, pivots to support, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation. Additional resistance matches the six-month range top — the 123.10-to-123.30 area — and an eventual close higher would more firmly signal a trend shift. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has asserted a strong summer downtrend, and remains tenuously positioned.

The August low rests at 23.98, and punctuates a successful initial retest. Separately, consider that the 200-week moving average (24.23) roughly matches support. Friday marked the first weekly close lower since 2014, a precarious posture. The late-2014 rally atop the 200-week moving average preceded a massive technical breakout. More plainly, the sluggish August price action leaves the dollar vulnerable to a potential downdraft. Tactically, resistance broadly spans from about 24.55 to 24.70, an area matching the breakdown point and trendline resistance. An eventual close higher would place the brakes on dollar bearish momentum. Also see the July 25 review. Moving to U.S. sectors, the transports have survived a major technical test.

203,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Tuesday that it was introducing a cheaper unlimited mobile data plan with some limits as it tries to lure customers away from rival wireless carriers. The plan, to be introduced on Wednesday, is priced at $75 a month for a single line and will include DVD-quality video streaming on smartphones rather than high definition. It allows Verizon to slow down consumers’ data speeds in times of congestion and does not include calling and data in Mexico and Canada. It also has slower mobile hotspot speeds of 600 kilobits per second. “While entry-level pricing appears more competitive, the changes more likely reflect the impact current plans are having on Verizon’s network,” Mike McCormack, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note. “The move also follows a trend of differentiating unlimited plans to manage congestion and monetize the network.” Verizon has been competing for customers with smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp in a saturated U.S. market for wireless service as most consumers already have cell phones. Other carriers have been launching aggressive promotions in recent months. Sprint said in June it was offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year to consumers who bring their own devices in a promotion aimed at Verizon subscribers. Verizon’s new cheaper plan is aimed at casual smartphone users versus customers who want to stream a lot of video, a Verizon spokeswoman said. The company also is introducing a higher-end unlimited data plan for $85 a month for a single line that includes HD-quality streaming on phones and calling, texting and data in Mexico and Canada, and mobile hotspot with up to 15 gigabytes of LTE speeds. The options will replace Verizon’s previous unlimited data plan, launched in February for $80 a month for a single line. Verizon shares were down 4 cents to $48.10 in morning trading. ","

204,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said SCA Promotions Inc was entitled to half of its $11 million contract with Yahoo as a cancellation penalty. It rejected Yahoo’s claim that Dallas-based SCA improperly leaked the promotion to Buffett and Berkshire, while trying to line up insurance coverage for the grand prize. Berkshire is well-known for insuring against potentially costly events with long odds, such as picking a perfect “March Madness” bracket, as the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament is known. “Any information that SCA disclosed to Berkshire Hathaway was not confidential information,” Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement wrote for a three-judge panel. Because SCA had kept Yahoo’s $1.1 million deposit, the appeals court on Monday awarded it another $4.4 million. The decision reversed a lower court ruling ordering SCA to return $550,000 of the deposit to Yahoo. “It has been a long battle over what we thought was a simple contractual provision,” Jon Patton, a lawyer for SCA, said in an interview. “We’re pleased the court of appeals got this right.” Charles Stewart, an Oath spokesman, said the unit does not discuss litigation. Berkshire and Quicken announced their “Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge” three weeks after Yahoo and SCA signed their contract, and Yahoo quickly agreed to co-sponsor it. No one won the top prize. Berkshire now sponsors a bracket contest for its roughly 368,000 employees. This year, a West Virginia factory worker won $100,000 for correctly choosing winners of the tournament’s first 29 games. The case is SCA Promotions Inc v Yahoo Inc, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-11254. ","

205,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"SEOUL/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd set out to wipe the slate clean in New York on Wednesday with its new Galaxy Note 8 “phablet,” hoping features like dual rear cameras and its biggest-ever screen will extinguish memories of the device’s fire-prone predecessor. Priced at $930 to $960 from network carriers, including a dialing and data plan, the Note 8 kicks off a new era of premium-priced handsets, which analysts expect to be joined by $1,000-plus iPhones next month. The unveiling came five months after the release of the Galaxy S8 smartphone. Analysts said brisk sales of that device indicate recovery in Samsung’s standing after battery fires prompted the October withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 just two months into sales, which cost the company billions of dollars. The recall and related safety concerns briefly cost Samsung its number one spot in the global smartphone rankings, according to researcher Counterpoint. It has since regained ground, with Strategy Analytics putting its second-quarter market share at 22 percent, more than Apple and China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] combined. “Of course no one will forget what happened last year, but we also won’t forget the millions that stuck with us,” DJ Koh, the company’s mobile chief, said at the launch event. The Note 8 will be sold from Sept. 15, Samsung said, without elaborating on place or price. Verizon Communications, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, said it will begin taking pre-orders on Thursday for the phone at a price of $960. Rival T-Mobile will offer it for $930. “I hate to say it, but $1,000 is becoming the new mark” for premium devices, said Bob O’Donnell of Technalysis Research. Samsung’s Note models usually sport bigger screens than the S series and come with a removable stylus. The trademark curved screen of the latest incarnation measures 6.3 inches (16 cm)corner to corner, just 0.1 inch bigger than the S8+. All of Samsung’s Galaxy line phones now have edge-to-edge displays. Apple’s new premium phone is expected to feature a similar display, but its update to the iPhone 7 might not, which could be a disadvantage for Apple, O’Donnell said. “The bar gets raised in terms of what people view as standard, and if you’re not meeting the bar, it’s going to have an impact,” he said. The South Korean company has been a main driver of growth in handsets with 6 inch-plus screens, a category Strategy Analytics expects to grow 10 times faster than the overall market next year. Samsung has also installed dual rear cameras on a handset for the first time, which promises improved photographic control and picture quality. But Samsung made no mention of so-called augmented reality features, in which digital images float over real-life objects on screen. Apple in June made that technology a major focal point of its next operating system. Other features include security technology, such as facial recognition and fingerprint and iris scanning, and artificial intelligence in the form of Samsung’s Bixby voice-command assistant. Samsung also took a jab at Apple at the launch event, mentioning its new phone will have a standard headphone jack, unlike the iPhone 7 with a single jack, a feature that has been criticized by some users.

206,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Windstream Services, LLC and its subsidiary Windstream Holdings of the Midwest, Inc. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. Windstream had approximately $5.6 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30, 2017. The Negative Outlook reflects slower-than-anticipated revenue and EBITDA stabilization for Windstream versus previous expectations. Fitch had expected Windstream to return to revenue growth in 2019, excluding the EarthLink merger and Broadview acquisition (the transactions). While Fitch expects cost synergies from the transactions to drive EBITDA stabilization by the end of the forecast, we do not expect revenue to return to growth over the forecast horizon. The slower path to revenue growth is mainly attributable to headwinds in the legacy businesses, including those acquired from EarthLink and Broadview. Fitch has revised its negative rating sensitivity for adjusted leverage to 5.5x from 5.7x-5.8x to reflect the challenging competitive and business environment, which, in turn, has led to continued delays in the return to revenue and EBITDA stability. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2018 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions and will remain relatively flat over the remainder of the forecast horizon. We believe the enhanced financial flexibility provided by the elimination of Windstream's dividend (net of cash used towards the $90 million share repurchase program) serves as an additional avenue for modest deleveraging. KEY RATING DRIVERS Near-Term Pressures The company has experienced some pressure in the wholesale and CLEC segments as a result of competition and declining legacy services. Excluding the transactions, Windstream experienced a decline of 3.4% in service revenue in 2016. Sequential revenues have been relatively stable in the ILEC consumer and small/medium business segment, and the enterprise segment. Including the transactions, Fitch's base case assumes organic revenues continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. Revenue Mix Changes Windstream derives approximately two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise services, consumer high-speed internet services and its carrier customers (core and wholesale), which all have growing or stable prospects in the long term. Certain legacy revenues remain pressured, but Windstream's revenues should stabilize gradually as legacy revenues dwindle in the mix. Leverage Metrics Fitch estimates total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be 5.8x in 2017, including both transactions. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2018 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions and will remain relatively flat over the remainder of the forecast horizon. The enhanced financial flexibility provided by the elimination of Windstream's dividend (net of cash used for share repurchases) serves as an additional avenue for modest deleveraging. In calculating total adjusted debt, Fitch applies an 8x multiple to the sum of the annual rental payment to Uniti Group Inc. plus other rental expenses. Cost Synergies Support EBITDA Stabilization Windstream anticipates realizing more than $180 million of annual run-rate synergies three years after the close of the EarthLink merger and Broadview Networks acquisition (the transactions): $155 million in operating cost savings and $25 million in capital spending savings. Windstream expects to realize $115 million in operating cost synergies after two years following the transactions, with roughly $40 million-$50 million to be realized by the end of year three. In its base case assumptions for Windstream, Fitch has assumed moderately lower cost savings in each of the three years following the transactions. Integration Key to Success Fitch believes there are potential execution risks to achieving the operating cost and capital expenditure synergies following the close of the transactions. Initial savings are expected to be realized from reduced selling, general and administrative savings as corporate overheads and other public company cost savings arise. Over time, the company is expected to realize the benefits of lower network access costs as on-network opportunities lower third-party network access costs. Finally, benefits are gradually expected to be realized by IT and billing system cost savings. DERIVATION SUMMARY Windstream mainly targets small and mid-sized business (SMB) customers, and competes in a highly fragmented space with smaller and larger peers. Cable operators are increasingly focused on medium-sized businesses and compete against Windstream in the SMB segment. Cable operators can also target other larger regional customers, including governments and universities. Larger wireline operators typically focus on enterprise customers, slightly reducing the level of competition in the SMB market for Windstream. Windstream has a weaker competitive position in the higher-margin enterprise market based on the scale and size of its operations. Larger companies, including AT&T Inc. ('A-'/RWN), Verizon Communications Inc. ('A-'/Stable), and CenturyLink, Inc. ('BB+'/RWN), have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. Fitch notes that CenturyLink will become the second largest enterprise service provider after it acquires Level 3 Communications, Inc. (LVLT; 'BB'/Stable), which is expected to close at the end of 3Q17. In comparison to Windstream, AT&T and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch also believes Windstream will have a weaker FCF profile than CenturyLink following the LVLT acquisition, as CenturyLink's FCF will benefit from enhanced scale and LVLT's net operating loss carryforwards. Windstream has less exposure to the more pressured residential market compared to its rural local exchange carrier (RLEC) peer, Frontier Communications Corp. ('B+'/Stable). Within the residential market, RLECs face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple-play offerings, including Comcast Corp. ('A-'/Stable) and Charter Communications Inc. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC, 'BB+'/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. RLECs have had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. As of year-end 2016, roughly 60% of Windstream's footprint overlapped with a national cable operator. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Windstream: --Revenue and EBITDA include the EarthLink merger as of Feb. 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Broadview on July 28, 2017. --Revenues total $5.9 billion and $6 billion in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Fitch expects organic revenue to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. --2017 EBITDA margins are in the range of 22% to 23%, including the annual rental payment as an operating expense. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to expand by roughly 100 bps in 2018 as Windstream cost synergies are realized. --Fitch assumes Windstream will benefit from synergies post-acquisition, and has moderately reduced the amount of operating cost synergies from the $155 million anticipated by Windstream over the next three years. --Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline from 5.8x at year-end 2017 to the mid-5x range by the end of 2018 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Stabilization of the Rating -The company sustains total adjusted debt/EBITDAR under 5.5x. Fitch has revised the negative adjusted leverage threshold to 5.5x from 5.7x-5.8x owing to the challenging competitive and business environment. -Revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize on a sustained basis. -Fitch would also need to see progress by Windstream in executing the integration of its recent transactions prior to stabilizing the rating. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 5.5x or higher for a sustained period. -The company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability due to competitive and business conditions. LIQUIDITY The rating is supported by the liquidity provided by Windstream's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). At June 30, 2017, approximately $475 million was available. Revolver availability was supplemented with $25 million in cash at the end of 2Q17. The $1.25 billion senior secured RCF is in place until April 2020. Principal financial covenants in Windstream's secured credit facilities require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x. The dividend is limited to the sum of excess FCF and net cash equity issuance proceeds subject to pro forma leverage of 4.5x or less. Outside of annual term-loan amortization payments, Windstream does not have any material maturities until 2020. Maturities in 2020 total $1.5 billion, including $750 million outstanding on the revolver at June 30, 2017. Fitch believes that Windstream's announcement in August 2017 to eliminate its dividend provides enhanced financial flexibility. We estimate post-dividend FCF in 2017 will range from $0 to negative $50 million, including integration capex and $50 million of spending related to the completion of Project Excel. Fitch expects capital spending to return to normal levels in the 13%-15% range after 2017 and for the company to return to positive FCF in 2018, with FCF margins in the low single digits over the forecast. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Windstream Services, LLC --IDR at 'BB-'; --$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2020 at 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured term loans at 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BB-/RR4'. Windstream Holdings of the Midwest, Inc. --IDR at 'BB-'; --$100 million secured notes due 2028 at 'BB-/RR4'. The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.

Kline,8242017,Fool,8172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere loves tweaking Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and does so frequently on social media. He has relentlessly used his popular Twitter account (4.46 million followers) to go after the rival carrier. His Twitter bio notes that he is focused on ""scaring our competitors!"" Legere recently has pushed the idea that Verizon's network has struggled under the weight of offering unlimited data. The outspoken, sometimes outrageous CEO has shared images of his own company's analysis of third-party speed test data showing Verizon offering slower download speeds than T-Mobile's. That data also shows Legere's company on a steady upward trend while key rivals Verizon and AT&T move in the opposite direction. Legere tweeted this on Aug. 22, when Verizon introduced new unlimited data plans: @Verizon just limited EVERYTHING about its “unlimited” plan…your network needs help! Just admit it already! pic.twitter.com/ccqPspHYMX  He also linked to a report on The Verge about Verizon's new tiered unlimited plans. There's some validity to Legere's claims since the new plans do throttle video to differing degrees depending upon which offer customers sign up for. It's hard to see that as anything other than an attempt to manage network traffic, which is not in itself a bad thing, but it does give at least a suggestion of validity to Legere's claims that ""Verizon's network is crumbling from offering unlimited."" T-Mobile's CEO likes to taunt his rivals on social media. Image source: T-Mobile. Verizon split its consumer unlimited plans into two tiers. The first, Go Unlimited, offers one line for $75, two for $130, three for $150, and four for $160. That plan lines up pretty well with T-Mobile, which offers one line for $70, two for $100, three for $140, and four for $160. In all cases T-Mobile is actually cheaper because its plans include taxes and fees. Verizon also offers the higher-end Beyond Unlimited. That service, which adds free calling, text, and data in Mexico and Canada as well as other perks, starts at $85 for one line, $160 for two, $180 for three, and $200 for four. All T-Mobile customers get free calling, text and high-speed data in Mexico, and Canada. The caveat with Verizon's new plans is that they throttle data when it comes to video, but at different levels. Go Unlimited ""offers DVD-quality video (SD on phones (480p) and HD on tablets (720p)), while video on Beyond Unlimited is HD for phones and tablets (720p for phones; 1080p for tablets),"" according to a Verizon press release. T-Mobile's regular unlimited plans also typically stream video at DVD-quality 480p rates. The carrier also offers its higher-end ""One Plus"" service with HD streaming video for an extra $10 a month per line. Only one of Verizon’s plans give you the option to scale up to 1080p (except on tablet), T-Mobile allows users to scale up to 1080p on all their plans on any device, (though regular T-Mobile ONE users need to purchase an HD pass in order to do so). T-Mobile's ONE Plus users have no cap on video streaming speeds (other than deprioritization after hitting the top 3% limit) while Verizon caps everyone at 10mbps. Both carriers offer 3G speeds for mobile hot spots on their cheaper plans. Verizon's higher-end offer includes 15GB of 4G LTE streaming while T-Mobile's includes 10GB. Competitive pressure that drives down prices benefits customers. Verizon has built its business on having the best wireless network and Legere has been pushing the idea that the added traffic from offering unlimited data has helped cause that to no longer be the case. There's statistical validity to the idea that Verizon's network has suffered as one of two widely accepted industry reports, OpenSignal's State of Mobile Networks Report, showed that T-Mobile now had the best network. The second study, from RootMetrics, however, still ranks Verizon on top, though it does show T-Mobile improving. T-Mobile has essentially gone after Verizon for offering the same unlimited plans it offers, albeit at slightly higher prices when you factor in taxes and fees. Legere sees the new pricing tiers as dual admissions of weakness. First, Verizon is trying to lessen traffic on its network by throttling video when it previously did not do that. Second, by lowering prices, the carrier has seemingly admitted that its network alone may not be enough to win over or keep customers. It's hard to see an upside to any of this for Verizon. The company is being forced to lower prices by a gleeful, upstart rival. The winners here are Legere, whose company has led the industry by adding more than 1  million new customers every quarter for four years, and consumers, who have seen prices fall with no end to that in sight.

    T-Mobile CEO John Legere Goes After Verizon -- Again -- The Motley Fool

212,Daniel B. Kline,8242017,Fool,8172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier Communication (NASDAQ:FTR) finished another quarter where it saw its subscriber count fall. That has become normal operating procedure for the company since it spent $10.54 billion buying Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida. In Q2, Frontier saw its total customer base drop from 5.2 million the previous quarter to 5.08 million. Again, the company not only lost 70,000 pay-television customers, it also dropped 100,000 broadband subscribers. The broadband losses are particularly bad because most pay-TV providers have seen losses in video, but have added internet customers. Frontier has been steadily getting smaller, but CEO Dan McCarthy has become very good at seeing the positive. He was no different in his remarks in the Q2 earnings release (courtesy of S&P Global Market Intelligence). ""We were pleased with the progress we made during the second quarter as we executed well on a number of key initiatives stabilizing operations,"" he said. ""In particular, we improved churn in our California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) market, saw progress in our commercial business, and continued to reduce costs, which resulted in increased adjusted EBITDA margins."" That's certainly putting a bright spin on the results. MCarthy and Frontier CFO Perley McBride shared much more during the company's earnings call with analysts following the release of the Q2 numbers. Frontier has been losing video subscribers as well as broadband customers. Image source: Getty Images. ""We continue to make good progress at stabilizing our consumer business, highlighted by the churn improvements in CTF FiOS as well as stable ARPC,"" said McCarthy. He also noted that ""the impact from the account cleanup is now entirely behind the company, and we are focused on getting voluntary churn back to benchmark level."" In the past two quarters the CEO blamed some of his company's customer loss on former Verizon customers who had never paid being removed. In Q2, customer churn improved to 2.24% (1.95% for Frontier Legacy and 2.69% for CTF operations) compared to 2.37% in Q1 2017 (1.95% for Frontier Legacy and 3.01% for CTF operations). Combined Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC) came in at $80.38, slightly down from $80.62 in the previous quarter. One of the biggest pain points in getting cable is waiting for a technician to come hook up your service. Frontier has a plan to address that. ""We remain on track to roll out our consumer-friendly FiOS self-installation process in the second half of the year, which we expect will improve customer satisfaction by providing customers the ability to complete FiOS installation on their own schedule,"" said McCarthy. ""We expect this process to increase efficiency and improve internal resource utilization by reducing our reliance on contractors."" Since buying the CTF properties Frontier has been aggressively cutting costs. A major reason for the Verizon purchase was giving Frontier the scale to operate more efficiently, and McCarthy said that has been happening. ""The company is starting to benefit from our overall efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives,"" he said. ""Specifically, during the quarter, we reported lower content cost partially due to our increased scale, a trend which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year."" Frontier was also able to lower its maintenance costs. McCarthy attributed that to ""to leveraging third-party partnerships as well as efficiencies from moving to a centralized reporting structure."" In recent quarters Frontier has been doing everything it can to conserve cash. That included cutting its dividend to $0.04 per share from $0.105 per share, where it has been for over two years. During the Q2 call McBride explained another financial move made by the company. Frontier obtained a $1.5 billion senior secured term loan B facility maturing on June 15, 2024. In June of 2017, Frontier used cash proceeds from the term loan B, offering to retire $763 million of 8.875% Notes due 2020 and $527 million of 8.500% Notes also due 2020. Our near-term maturity profile is manageable with $583 million of bonds due in Q4 of 2018, $434 million due in 2019, less than $1 billion due in 2020, and we continue to have an undrawn $850 million revolver. That's a detailed way to say that Frontier continues to enjoy flexibility from its lenders. That's especially important as the company struggles to reverse, or at least stabilize, its subscriber losses. ","

213, ,8242017,Fool,8172017,"RootMetrics has come out with yet another report. This time instead of pitting each of the four US carriers against each other, it puts all of the metro areas in the nation against each other. And the top five markets might be a bit surprising to some. The market with the best overall mobile network is Lansing, Michigan, who actually has the 117th largest population in the nation. Lansing had an overall score of 98.5. That was followed by Indianapolis who had a score of 98.3, Modesto, California with a score of 98.2, Chicago, Illinois and Port St. Lucie, Florida which were tied for fourth place with a 98 score. It's important to talk about how RootMetrics ranks these metro areas. RootMetrics went to the top 125 most populated metro markets over the course of the first 6 months of 2017. And it tested network reliability, network speed, data speed, calls and texts, which all made up the overall performance score. The scores are based on an average taken from its tests on all four major US carriers - AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. Each of these networks are weighted by the percentage of customers it has in that metro market. For instance, if New York City has more Verizon customers than Sprint does, then Verizon's score would factor more into the overall score for the city than Sprint, AT&T or T-Mobile's would. Throughout its testing, RootMetrics found that bigger doesn't necessarily mean a better network. Out of the top 5 largest markets, only one of them were in the five best markets for mobile networks, which was Chicago, and it was tied for fourth. The two largest cities, New York City and Los Angeles respectively, ranked 74th and 77th out of 125, respectively. Which is pretty low, actually. The good thing here is that all 125 metro areas did get a score above 90, which means these mobile networks are actually fairly decent. While they may not be perfect in each of the 125 metro markets, they do offer some pretty good service. You can check out the full list from RootMetrics latest report by following the link in the source section below, and you can see where your city landed on the list.

214,Daniel B. Kline,8242017,Fool,8172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big wireless, or more clearly biggest wireless, has a problem. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) used to market their more-expensive services on the fact that they offered better networks. That's no longer clearly the case. Of the two widely accepted industry studies on the subject, one from RootMetrics shows the gap narrowing between the four major carriers. The second study, from OpenSignal, puts T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) in the lead. In reality ""best network"" can mean different things to different people. It depends a lot on where you live, where you travel, and how you use your phone. The one truth, and it's something Sprint (NYSE:S) has been pushing in its ads, is that all networks are now pretty much the same. Sprint has been using Verizon's former pitchman Paul Marcarelli to tout that all networks are pretty much the same. Image source: Sprint. People will pay more for better service. History has shown that customers will actually pay more for even the perception of better service. AT&T and Verizon used to actually have superior networks to T-Mobile and Sprint, but now they mostly only have the perception of being better. That's an image that has been fading as both low-cost carriers have been heavily marketing the idea that network quality is no longer a differentiating factor. As this idea becomes more accepted, one of two things, or perhaps both, will happen to AT&T and Verizon. They will either lose customers, lower prices, or suffer some combination of the two. It's nearly impossible to believe that consumers will pay higher prices for roughly the same thing once they understand that's what they are doing. All prices are as of 8/14/17 and subject to change. As you can see in the chart above, Sprint has the best deal (though it's a promotion that could end) while Verizon charges the most. T-Mobile's prices are actually lower than they appear because the company includes taxes and fees in its base price. Verizon and AT&T were forced by T-Mobile and Sprint into offering unlimited data plans costing them billions in overage charges. That pressure is going to increase as T-Mobile continues building a reputation as having the best combination of network and price while Sprint uses extreme discounting to win customers. T-Mobile has 17 straight quarters where it has added more than 1 million customers. Sprint has turned a corner and reported positive income for the first time in three years in Q1 and it has the stock price upside that the company is very much available for sale or merger. That could mean a merger with T-Mobile, or another buyer, but either scenario likely means bad news for AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile have the most upside in the wireless industry because they have built their business on what matters to consumers now. AT&T and Verizon built theirs on a network quality advantage that has either eroded greatly or no longer exists. That's going to lead to more pain for both companies as they adjust to a changed market, and T-Mobile and Sprint should profit from that pain. ","

215,Eric Volkman,8242017,Fool,8172017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Like most of the investing world, Warren Buffett thrives on dividends. The veteran financier and leading light of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) receives plenty of them; in the second quarter, for example, Berkshire was set to reap nearly $900 million in such payouts. Although Buffett prefers that the companies under Berkshire's wing reinvest their profits into growing their respective businesses rather than paying dividends, he is fond of getting such distributions from his stocks. The proof of this sentiment is in Berkshire's top two dividend yielders, both of which pay out handsomely. Here are a few words about this generous duo. Image source: Getty Images. Cellphone provider Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is no longer an important position for Berkshire Hathaway. Following a big sell-off earlier this year, Buffett's conglomerate held only 928 shares as of the end of June. That makes it Berkshire's lightest holding in terms of share count, by far (it holds over 59,000 shares of the next-lightest, UPS). Funnily enough, Verizon is the stock that yields the most (4.8%) in the company's immense portfolio. Although Berkshire won't benefit much from owning such a modest amount of its stock, the big telecom -- half of what is effectively a duopoly, along with AT&T, atop its industry -- certainly still has much potential. The company has invested heavily on content, buying AOL in 2015 and Yahoo! the following year to create the Oath media unit. This should make its offerings more attractive for subscribers, and its service ""stickier."" It also delivered an impressive second quarter, thanks in no small part to a new unlimited plan, which helped rope in thousands of new customers. Finally, it's working hard to develop its Internet of Things offerings, a potentially thick revenue stream. That potential should keep the market very interested in the stock and support its price. This will be aided enormously by the dividend, which should be at least sustainable given that the company's latest quarterly payout ratio was 60%. STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR) was plucked from relative obscurity to stock stardom after Berkshire revealed earlier this year that it bought nearly 10% of the company's shares. STORE Capital is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in retail properties. Although it's been an unheralded player in its segment (at least until Buffett got his hands on it), the company does its thing extremely well and knows how to make a buck. Total assets and revenue have risen lately at impressive rates. This, naturally, filters down into solid bottom-line performance. The company's funds from operations (the most accurate profitability metric for REITs) have also seen a nice climb, rising 30% on a year-over-year basis to more than $72 million in Q2. STORE Capital's store is very much open for business these days. The company's overall occupancy rate during said quarter was 99.5%, a huge proportion given the high number of properties (1,770) that it manages. On top of that, an aggressive acquisition policy has helped the REIT post those excellent gains, and the new assets coming into the portfolio should continue to aid growth. To maintain their status as REITs, companies like STORE Capital are required to distribute nearly all of their net profits in the form of dividends. Buffett and his fellow shareholders received $0.29 per share for the quarter, putting the company's yield at just over 4.6% on the most recent closing stock price. ","

Still, there are some companies that seem like very good bets to be around for a while. A few are even good bets for growth over the next decade-plus. Here's why our Foolish investors think Corning (NYSE:GLW), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are good choices for long-term-minded investors now. Steve Symington (Corning): Founded in 1851, Corning arguably knows better than any other company what it takes to survive and thrive in today's fast-changing world. And the glass technologist is not only investing heavily in both its core business and future growth opportunities, but also promises to reward investors with aggressive capital returns in the process. In late 2015 the company outlined a strategic capital-allocation framework with a goal of returning at least $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases by 2019. In addition, Corning promised to invest $10 billion in the business through research, development, and engineering. Corning is on track to meet both goals as of its most recent quarterly report, two weeks ago. Corning's optical-fiber technology has driven big growth for its Optical Communications segment. Image source: Corning, Inc. What's more, Corning's strength stems from multiple market verticals. In recent years Corning has made most of its money from its core Display Technologies segment, which includes specialized glass substrates for liquid crystal displays on smartphones, computers, and TVs. But as telecommunications giants build out their next-generation fiber networks -- Verizon (NYSE:VZ), for example, committed to purchase at least $1.05 billion in optical fiber and associated products from Corning earlier this year -- Corning's thriving Optical Communications business finally exceeded Display Technologies in terms of revenue last quarter. Meanwhile, Corning is enjoying strong growth from its Specialty Materials business, thanks to adoption of its popular scratch- and shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass products in next-gen smartphones and tablets. To that end, Corning also sees future applications for various glass products aimed at revolutionizing the automotive industry -- that is, outside of its glass ceramic substrates and particulate filters already found in millions of vehicles' pollution-control systems. And the company recently unveiled a cutting-edge pharmaceutical-packaging solution, dubbed Corning Valor Glass, which was the product of close collaboration with Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). In short, we're talking about a growing, solidly profitable 166-year-old company whose reach extends deep into multiple promising industries. And I see no reason Corning won't still be innovating and generating shareholder value in 2030. Keith Noonan (Disney): The market hasn't responded favorably to Disney's most recent quarterly results and the accompanying announcement that it will be shifting content away from Netflix in order to start its own streaming service. In fact, the company saw its worst trading day in over a year -- with shares down roughly 5% since its Aug. 8 earnings report -- but investors shouldn't be deterred by recent stock turbulence. On the contrary, the sell-off presents a buying opportunity for what looks to be the best long-term stock in the media industry. While Disney's $1.8 billion investment to purchase the remaining stake in streaming company BAMTech and move away from an already successful relationship with Netflix create near-term uncertainty, the company believes that having its own over-the-top offering will ultimately be much more profitable. There are compelling reasons to think that will be the case. Disney now trades at roughly 17 times forward estimated earnings, and also has considerable appeal as a dividend growth stock. The recent sell-offs have pushed the stock's yield to 1.5%, the company has boosted its payout 108% over the last five years, and, with a payout ratio of just 26.5%, Disney has a lot flexibility to deliver payout growth going forward. Between its attractive valuation, income generation, and competitive advantages, Disney looks like a stock for the ultra-long term. John Rosevear (Amazon.com): It might have started out as a quirky online bookstore, but two decades later, Amazon.com has become the 800-pound gorilla of retail -- and it might just be getting started. Already, Amazon is a dominant player in a slew of retail categories: Clothing, tools, shoes, computers and consumer electronics, housewares, and a long list of others (including books). That list will only get longer over time. For instance, Amazon has recently made big moves into segments like auto parts, health and beauty, and even groceries, with its pending purchase of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM). Amazon Vehicles is just an information center right now, but it's one piece of evidence suggesting that the online retail giant is pondering a move into auto sales. Image source: Amazon.com But CEO Jeff Bezos is far from satisfied. There are growing signs that Amazon is looking to break into one of the toughest retail spaces of all, auto sales. And today's Amazon stretches well beyond what we used to call ""e-commerce,"" with a hugely important web services division and big investments in artificial intelligence that will open many more doors for growth well into the future. Of course, there are caveats. Unlike its consumer goods, which are usually very competitively priced, Amazon's stock isn't cheap and it could take a hit if and when the market gets choppy. And Amazon's profits remain thin because of Bezos' relentless push to reinvest in future growth. Still, this is a company that is clearly built to last a long time -- and just as clearly, one that's set to grow like few others for many years to come. ","

Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) released impressive fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Aug. 24 after the market closed, highlighting hundreds of new customers across various disparate industries. This also marks the 11th time in as many reports that the operational-intelligence platform specialist has beaten expectations. Let's have a closer look at what Splunk accomplished over the past few months. Image source: Splunk. Fiscal Q2 2018* Fiscal Q2 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $280.0 million $212.8 million 31.6% GAAP net income (loss) ($83.5 million) ($86.6 million) N/A GAAP earnings (loss) per share ($0.60) ($0.65) N/A Data source: Splunk. *For the quarter ended July 31,2017. Splunk CEO Doug Merritt stated: I am pleased with the solid sales execution in Q2, particularly our results in EMEA [Europe, the Middle East, and Africa]. As I traveled across Europe, Asia, and North America over the last two months, I was excited to see businesses, governments and universities adopting Splunk across multiple departments and use cases. Customer success and product innovation are at the heart of what we do. For the fiscal third quarter of 2018, Splunk expects revenue to be between $307 million and $309 million -- above the $306.9 million investors were anticipating -- with adjusted operating margin of 8%. As a result, Splunk once again increased its full fiscal-year 2018 guidance to call for billings of $1.450 billion, up from $1.425 billion previously, and revenue of between $1.210 billion and $1.215 billion, up from $1.195 billion previously. Splunk also reiterated its expectation for full fiscal-year adjusted operating margin of roughly 8%. All things considered -- and though it shouldn't be terribly surprising, given Splunk's propensity for under-promising and over-delivering -- there was nothing not to like about this report from an investor's perspective. Customers from a wide variety of industries continue to adopt Splunk's solutions in droves. And the company is translating that adoption to stellar revenue growth as its GAAP losses continue to narrow. With shares of Splunk down around 9% over the past three months in spite of its quarterly beat and raise in May, it was hard to blame the market for bidding up the stock after hours following the earnings release.

Stronger-than-expected sales was welcome news after Verizon struggled with its top line in 2016. More importantly, Verizon stock had been stuck in a rut thanks to negativity surrounding its wireless business. Most notably, Verizon’s first-quarter report in April showed the company lost wireless customers on a net basis for the first time ever. The July 27 report that lifted Verizon stock showed both prepaid and postpaid connections on the rise, with churn rates under control. The result has been a more than 10% run for Verizon shares in about two weeks. Wireless undoubtedly is the future of telecom. So the fact that Verizon could counter the negativity about its wireless operations really helps counter the bearish narrative that existed previously.

                                    hasn’t had much to write home about since 2015. For starters, the company’s once-impressive growth rate slowed considerably, while the much-hyped biotech sector started to look overvalued and fall out of favor as the market went “risk off.” Since then, a few biotech names have managed to get their mojo back, but Illumina has failed to re-attain its share-price highs of 2015. All that could change this year, as the company seems to be getting back into a groove after a rather volatile 2016. For starters, Illumina won back investors with one of the best January performances on Wall Street. That was in part because of strong fourth-quarter 2016 earnings and optimistic guidance. Coupled with a general hope of deregulation thanks to a GOP-controlled Congress, investors were pleased. In the absence of any news to spark another leg up, Illumina stock has crawled ahead with the market. But in early August when the company offered up a solid second-quarter report that included a nice earnings beat, robust revenue growth, and better-than-expected guidance, it was off to the races. Illumina stock popped by double digits in a single session and proved it still can deliver dynamic returns to biotech investors.

Negative news items included a lowered outlook in February, miserable earnings in March despite the warning, and a decision to stop discounting handbags that had many investors worried about irreparable harm to sales. But Kors has proved the naysayers wrong. For starters, its August earnings wowed investors as adjusted EPS blew away expectations. And while revenue declined, it was better than Wall Street expected.

But since then, Ralph Lauren stock has mounted a minor comeback. As with Michael Kors, earnings had a big role in recent gains. Ralph Lauren erased last year’s quarterly loss in a big way, posting significant profits that trounced expectations. And while revenue declined again, it also beat forecasts.

After all, this is a company that has seen declining profits and a stagnant top line for some time — and while it may have looked like a bargain in 2016, there were reasons to wonder if the run was over. Boeing put those concerns to rest, however, with a raised outlook and impressive earnings beat at the end of July. Since that report, Boeing stock has tacked on another 13%. A huge dividend increase earlier this year, to $1.42 per share quarterly from $1.09, is even more reason to stick with this stock. Yes, short-term drivers propelled the run at the end of 2016, but improving fundamentals and continued momentum suggest that Boeing shares are going to remain aloft.

The question now is the rally attempt’s quality. Near-term resistance (2,437) is followed by firmer overhead matching the former breakout point, the June peak of 2,453. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly maintained its first notable support. The specific area matches its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — better illustrated on the daily chart. Conversely, the Dow’s near-term breakdown point (21,840) pivots to resistance, and the initial retest should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has reached one-month lows. Still, a retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath, currently 6,271, is underway early Tuesday. On further strength, major overhead matches the 6,344 area, also illustrated on the daily chart below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has stalled at the 6,342 breakdown point, and violated the 50-day moving average, currently 6,271. More broadly, the prevailing downturn originates from the late-July key reversal (the long red bar) and includes two directionally sharp August downdrafts. The intervening rally attempts have thus far been flat. Bearish intermediate-term price action. Tactically, a rally atop the 50-day would mark technical progress, while a close atop the 6,342 breakdown point would more firmly neutralize the August downturn. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains the strongest major benchmark. To reiterate, the index has narrowly maintained its breakout point — Dow 21,682 — an area closely followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 21,642. Viewed in isolation, the Dow’s August downturn has inflicted limited true technical damage. Meanwhile, the S&P 500’s jagged August downturn has inflicted damage. Namely, the S&P has violated its breakout point (2,453) a level closely matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,450. Conversely, significant support broadly spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. This week’s low currently rests at 2,417. Broadly speaking, the August downturn remains uneven — the technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all — though damage has been inflicted. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have tagged one-month lows, punctuating recent violations of the 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials remain comparably resilient, maintaining the first well-defined support. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has violated the 200-day moving average, currently 136.95. The downturn originates from a failed test of the breakdown point (138.85), nearly to the decimal. Bearish price action. Delving deeper, important support broadly spans from about 132.40 to 133.70. This area defines the range bottom, and matches the 2017 low. A violation opens the path to less-charted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Conversely, a nearly immediate rally atop the 200-day would place the brakes on bearish momentum. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has registered three straight closes under the 200-day moving average, currently 310.50. Here again, the downturn punctuates a failed test of the breakdown point. More broadly, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have concurrently registered three-month lows. (Separately, consider that the iShares Russell 2000 ETF was narrowly negative year-to-date at Monday’s close — by a two-cent margin. The MDY has registered about a 2.2% year-to-date gain.)

                                   remains comparably stronger than the small- and mid-caps. The 200-day moving average, currently 234.90, remains distant. Still, the SPY has violated two key inflection points: Moreover, the tandem August downturns — the violations of support — have been fueled by volume spikes, encompassing a lighter-volume rally attempt. Bearish near-term price action. A retest of the 50-day moving average from underneath is underway early Tuesday, and should be a useful bull-bear gauge. Collectively, the widely-tracked U.S. benchmarks continue to diverge. The prevailing technical backdrop is not one-size-fits-all. As it applies to the S&P 500, a near- to intermediate-term consolidation phase is underway. These respective trends are in flux. Recall that notable support spans from 2,405 to 2,416, levels matching the breakout point, and the June FAANG-induced low. See Friday’s review. The S&P has bottomed this week at 2,417 — matching support — and the question now is the rally attempt’s quality. When gauging the quality, notable S&P resistance spans from 2,450 to 2,453, levels matching the 50-day moving average, and the June peak. A retest from underneath is within view early Tuesday, and worth tracking. To reiterate, a nearly immediate reversal atop the 2,450 breakout point would place the S&P on firmer technical ground. Beyond technical levels, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop has softened, as detailed Friday, and the August rally attempts have thus far lacked quality. The S&P 500’s more important longer-term trend remains firmly bullish. See also: Bull trend intact, S&P 500 absorbs mid-August plunge.

220,,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"(Reuters) - Fusion Telecommunications International Inc plans to buy the cloud and business services unit of Birch Communications in an all-stock deal that it said would broaden its customer base. Fusion shares rose 70 percent to $2.09 on Monday on news of the deal, which would form one of the largest North American cloud services providers, with more than 150,000 business customers, 30 data centers and 31,000 miles of fiber network. Fusion’s management will run the combined company. However, private equity firm Birch Equity Partners LLC, Birch’s majority owner, will get 75 percent of the new company, while Fusion shareholders will have only 25 percent. Together, the company expects annual revenue of $575 million. The deal is the latest example of consolidation in the business communications sector as smaller vendors like Fusion try to lure enterprise customers from larger companies such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc by offering integrated voice, data and cloud services. Last year CenturyLink Inc announced plans to buy Level 3 Communications Inc for $24 billion. The deal is still awaiting regulatory clearance. “We are picking up a much broader set of customers,” said Fusion Chief Executive Officer Matthew Rosen, who will become the combined company’s chairman. “We’ll be able to cross-sell and upsell everything from contact center software to storage, disaster recovery and other cloud solutions.” The deal does not include Birch’s less-profitable business of providing communications services to consumers. Birch Equity and other Birch shareholders will get about 73 million Fusion shares that the companies said would be worth $3.85 each, or about $281 million in total. That would be a premium of more than 200 percent to Fusion’s closing price on Friday. Fusion has agreed to assume Birch’s existing debt of about $458 million. It will refinance that along with its own debt of about $101 million. “We believe that given the cash flows, we are in a good position,” Rosen said. Birch, a private nationwide telecommunications company founded in Atlanta in 1996, had already been diversifying. It bought cloud provider CBeyond for $323 million in 2014 to expand its services to small- and medium-size businesses. Fusion, a smaller New York-based company with a market capitalization of $47.94 million on Monday, has done several smaller deals as well, such as the $28 million acquisition of business communications firm Apptix last year. Fusion’s financial adviser was FTI Consulting, while Birch’s was Moelis & Co. ","

221,,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc said on Wednesday that it is expanding its 5G trials to include three new U.S. cities by the end of the year as part of its push to develop a next-generation network. The trials will test a faster broadband service where the last leg of the connection is delivered via a radio signal to a home or business using high-band wireless airwaves known as millimeter wave. Participants in the trials will be able to stream AT&T’s DirecTV Now service over a 5G connection as well as experience shorter lag times for uses such as video conferencing and virtual-reality gaming. The No. 2 wireless carrier, which is currently conducting similar trials in Austin, will extend them to Waco, Texas; Kalamazoo, Michigan; and South Bend, Indiana, the company said. In those markets, AT&T plans to have more trial participants, which could include small businesses, universities and churches, and larger coverage areas. The service, called fixed wireless, is expected to be the first application of 5G technologies and could eventually be a competitor to the high-speed Internet services offered by cable companies. It could also be less costly to the companies than deploying fiber to the home. The tests are intended to help AT&T determine whether millimeter wave spectrum can travel through foliage and buildings, as well as how weather affects the signal. The company expects deployment of the service as early as late 2018. It is working with Ericsson, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Nokia and Intel Corp on the trials. Rival wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc has said it is conducting pre-commercial trials for fixed wireless in 11 cities and that it expects a 2018 launch. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in an interview that fixed wireless service would likely serve niche markets where there is no existing infrastructure for broadband. “If there is physical infrastructure, the business case for fixed wireless becomes pretty challenging,” he said. “You’re more likely to get more reliable service over fiber.” Still, both AT&T and Verizon have been buying millimeter wave spectrum in preparation for fixed wireless and recently got into a bidding war over an asset. In May, Verizon snapped up wireless spectrum holder Straight Path Communications Inc in a $3.1 billion deal, roughly double AT&T’s initial offer. ","

222,,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Yahoo must face nationwide litigation brought on behalf of well over 1 billion users who said their personal information was compromised in three massive data breaches. Wednesday night’s decision from U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, was a setback for efforts by Verizon Communications Inc, which paid $4.76 billion for Yahoo’s Internet business in June, to limit potential liability. The breaches occurred between 2013 and 2016, but Yahoo was slow to disclose them, waiting more than three years to reveal the first. Revelations about the scope of the cyber attacks prompted Verizon to lower its purchase price for the company. In a 93-page decision, Koh rejected Yahoo’s contention that breach victims lacked standing to sue, and said they could pursue some breach of contract and unfair competition claims. “All plaintiffs have alleged a risk of future identity theft, in addition to loss of value of their personal identification information,” the judge wrote. Koh said some plaintiffs also alleged they had spent money to thwart future identity theft or that fraudsters had misused their data. Others, meanwhile, could have changed passwords or canceled their accounts to stem losses had Yahoo not delayed disclosing the breaches, the judge said. While many claims were dismissed, Koh said the plaintiffs could amend their complaint to address her concerns. “We believe it to be a significant victory for consumers, and will address the deficiencies the court pointed out,” John Yanchunis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who chairs an executive committee overseeing the case, said in an interview. “It’s the biggest data breach in the history of the world.” Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni said the New York-based company declined to comment on pending litigation. Yahoo is now part of a Verizon unit called Oath. In court papers, Yahoo had argued that the breaches were “a triumph of criminal persistence” by a “veritable ‘who’s who’ of cybercriminals,” and that no security system is hack-proof. On March 15, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two officers of the Russian Federal Security Service and two hackers in connection with the second breach in late 2014. The August 2013 breach affected more than 1 billion accounts, while the 2014 breach affected more than 500 million. A third breach occurred in 2015 and 2016. The case is In re: Yahoo Inc Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02752. ","

223,,8312017,Reuters,8242017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House committee said on Wednesday it has canceled a planned hearing on Sept. 7 on the future of internet access rules after no companies publicly committed to appearing. Among those who had been invited in late July to share thoughts before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee were the chief executives of Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. The hearing had the potential to be one of the most high-profile appearances of major tech CEOs on Capitol Hill. Zach Hunter, a spokesman for the committee’s chairman, U.S. Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, said the hearing was postponed because of talks over the future rules. “As negotiations progress on a permanent solution for net neutrality that ensures a free and open internet, the committee will postpone the original hearing in order to allow talks between stakeholders to continue,” he said. Republican lawmakers had hoped to bring top executives from tech companies and internet providers to testify publicly in a bid to garner support for a deal to set permanent rules on the future of internet access after a more than decade-long fight. No company had publicly committed to testify and many firms were privately reluctant to testify. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission under President Donald Trump has been moving to scrap rules implemented under the Obama administration that regulated broadband internet like a utility. The rules bar providers from blocking or slowing websites, or allowing websites to pay for “fast lanes” over competitors. Internet providers and major tech companies have been sharply divided over the issue. Many providers want Congress to step in and write permanent rules, while internet firms say the regulations are critical to preserving the open internet. Major internet firms and service providers have been meeting with committee aides in recent weeks, but Democrats have not agreed to work toward a compromise bill, arguing the Obama rules should be left in place. Republicans on the House panel plan to consider a bill to reauthorize the FCC next month that could address internet access rules. Other corporate chiefs invited to testify included the heads of Comcast Corp Netflix Inc and Charter Communications Inc. In May, the FCC voted 2-1 to advance Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to withdraw the 2015 order reclassifying internet service providers as if they were utilities. The FCC is considering whether it has the authority to limit internet providers’ ability to block, throttle or offer “paid prioritization,” and whether it should keep any protections in place. ","

226, ,8312017,CNBC,8242017,"AT&T said on Wednesday that it is expanding its 5G trials to include three new U.S. cities by the end of the year as part of its push to develop a next-generation network. The trials will test a faster broadband service where the last leg of the connection is delivered via a radio signal to a home or business using high-band wireless airwaves known as millimeter wave. Participants in the trials will be able to stream AT&T's DirecTV Now service over a 5G connection as well as experience shorter lag times for uses such as video conferencing and virtual-reality gaming. The No. 2 wireless carrier, which is currently conducting similar trials in Austin, will extend them to Waco, Texas; Kalamazoo, Michigan; and South Bend, Indiana, the company said. In those markets, AT&T plans to have more trial participants, which could include small businesses, universities and churches, and larger coverage areas. The service, called fixed wireless, is expected to be the first application of 5G technologies and could eventually be a competitor to the high-speed Internet services offered by cable companies. It could also be less costly to the companies than deploying fiber to the home. The tests are intended to help AT&T determine whether millimeter wave spectrum can travel through foliage and buildings, as well as how weather affects the signal. The company expects deployment of the service as early as late 2018. It is working with Ericsson, Samsung Electronics, Nokia, and Intel on the trials. Rival wireless carrier Verizon Communications has said it is conducting pre-commercial trials for fixed wireless in 11 cities and that it expects a 2018 launch. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in an interview that fixed wireless service would likely serve niche markets where there is no existing infrastructure for broadband. ""If there is physical infrastructure, the business case for fixed wireless becomes pretty challenging,"" he said. ""You're more likely to get more reliable service over fiber."" Still, both AT&T and Verizon have been buying millimeter wave spectrum in preparation for fixed wireless and recently got into a bidding war over an asset. In May, Verizon snapped up wireless spectrum holder Straight Path Communications in a $3.1 billion deal, roughly double AT&T's initial offer. ",AT&T to expand 5G US broadband trials,0.5256

230,Adam Levy,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After blowing away expectations with its second-quarter earnings report, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) showed the strength of its brand and network are still well intact. Given the option between unlimited plans from all four major carriers, customers increasingly chose Verizon's network. It managed to add over 600,000 postpaid customers and over 350,000 phone customers, specifically. While not the most in the industry -- that title still belongs to T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) -- it's a big step up from last year and the previous quarter. And it points to both the success and the importance of Verizon's unlimited data plan, which it unveiled in February. But Verizon is taking steps to moderate the amount of data on its network. It's launching a new, less expensive plan ($75 per month for a single line) that throttles video quality down to 480p. Subscribers that want high-definition video can opt for a more expensive plan ($85 per month), but even then, they're limited to 720p on phones and 1080p on tablets. This is just another sign that Verizon is having trouble keeping up with the data demands of its customers. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's new throttled video plans are an attempt to manage the amount of data clogging its pipes. It's not a unique strategy. In fact, when T-Mobile introduced unlimited video streaming for all of its customers a couple years ago, it relied on throttled video quality to do it. The move actually ended up saving the company bandwidth. Verizon is likely hoping for similar results. Verizon's network speeds started suffering as soon as it started offering an unlimited data option, according to recent test results from Ookla. Verizon isn't alone. AT&T (NYSE:T) is also showing signs of a slowdown following the introduction of its unlimited plans. Verizon's network strength is integral to its success. It's part of the company's ad campaigns and its branding. While it's constantly working to improve LTE capacity and speed, its attention is now split between it and 5G. While Verizon is certainly looking to free up additional bandwidth on its network with the move to a tiered unlimited plan, it may also be an appropriate response to recent pricing moves from the competition. T-Mobile upped its One Plus plan by $5 to match Verizon's $80 per month price point. The new pricing puts a bit more distance between T-Mobile's and Verizon's, maintaining its pricing premium. Meanwhile, AT&T's top-tier plan starts at $90 per month, still $5 more than the new $85 per month Verizon plan. That plan, however, also includes free HBO and a $25 discount on any AT&T television bundle. AT&T is offering a lot more value; Verizon is offering its network, which is still No. 1 for now. Although Verizon is offering a pricier option, it's likely a lot of users will opt to switch to the less expensive unlimited plan. Current subscribers can opt to keep their current plan, but they'll still be subjected to the same throttling as the $85 per month plan. Only new subscribers who want high definition video will have to pay the higher price. As a result, Verizon could face continued pressure on its service revenue per user. Management said it expects the metric to start recovering in the second half of the year, but this move could put a damper on that recovery. Management expects service revenue to improve as more subscribers switch from data buckets to unlimited data. To be sure, the new lower-tier unlimited plan is still more expensive than most of Verizon's old data plans. But that trend could be offset by early unlimited adopters downgrading to save a bit more money while staying on Verizon's network. Service revenue will be something to keep an eye on through the second half of the year, and be on the lookout for semi-annual network quality reports from third parties to see if Verizon's network strength is holding up with the influx of unlimited data subscribers.

It's important to stick with what you know when it comes to investing. U.S retirees buying only U.S. stocks makes sense with that in mind. However, a whole world of international stocks awaits investors willing to venture outside the United States. There are risks, of course, but there are also opportunities. We asked three of our Foolish investors to each put forth an international stock that would be well suited for a retiree's portfolio, safety being the watchword. Here's why retirees should consider Unilever (NYSE:UL), Public Joint-Stock Company Mobile TeleSystems (NYSE:MBT), and Sanofi (NYSE:SNY). Image source: Getty Images. Tim Green (Unilever): For retirees looking for a relatively safe international stock, Dutch-British consumer-products giant Unilever fits the bill. The company is massive, generating 52 billion euros of revenue last year, and it's wildly profitable, with operating margins consistently in the mid-teens. Unilever owns a massive number of brands, including Dove, Hellmann's, Lipton, Ben & Jerry's, and countless more. According to the company, 2.5 billion people use Unilever products on any given day. Unilever stock isn't particularly cheap, trading for around 25 times earnings, but paying up for a massive stable of popular and durable brands makes sense. Unilever pays a dividend, with the ADR currently yielding about 2.6%, providing a nice income for retiree shareholders. Currency effects can cause swings in the dividend, but on a constant-currency basis, Unilever's dividend has increased by 7.4% annually between 2010 and 2016. Unilever's global scale and vast collection of powerful brands give the company important competitive advantages. There's always the risk that some of its brands become stale and susceptible to upstart competitors. But given the breadth of Unilever's business, the company should be able to continue producing exceptional profits for the foreseeable future. Those dividend payments won't stop anytime soon. Rich Smith: (Public Joint-Stock Company Mobile TeleSystems): What should an investor look for in an international stock? At the risk of stating the obvious, I'd say an investor should look for something that he or she cannot find just as easily right here at home. Think about it. If I tell you that AT&T (NYSE:T) or Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are great stocks for retirees to own, you might respond, ""Sure! They both pay good, strong dividends of about 5%.They're not unreasonably expensive at about 12.6 times forward earnings. Those sound like fine stocks for a retiree to own."" Or you might say, ""No way! T-Mobile is eating their lunch. AT&T and Verizon are doomed!"" So what are your incentives for buying Mobile TeleSystems instead of a domestic telecom? Well, the dividend for one thing. Mobile TeleSystems pays its shareholders a 10% dividend, which is roughly twice the payout at AT&T or Verizon. Growth is another factor in its favor. Analysts expect Mobile TeleSystems to grow its earnings at nearly 10% annually over the next five years -- twice AT&T's expected 5% growth rate, and three times the 3% projected  growth rate at Verizon. Topping it all off, Mobile TeleSystems stock costs only 8.7 times forward earnings -- about 30% cheaper than either AT&T or Verizon. For a retiree looking to invest in international stocks, I think Mobile TeleSystems is a fine pick. George Budwell (Sanofi): Shares of the French biopharma giant Sanofi have been markedly outperforming most of their large-cap drug-manufacturing peers this year because of the unexpected strength of both Sanofi's vaccine portfolio and an emerging multiple sclerosis franchise. In fact, the drugmaker's shares are currently up close to a healthy 20% so far this year. A big reason investors have been piling in to this French drugmaker is that the company's newer, long-acting insulin product, Toujeo, has been helping to largely offset the expected decline in the sales of its former flagship diabetes medication, Lantus, that's now under pressure from generic competitors. Previously, industry insiders weren't entirely convinced Toujeo would be up to the task, but the drug's extremely rapid commercial uptake clearly suggests otherwise. Apart from Sanofi's proven ability to overcome major new competitive threats to key brands, the company also sports a top-notch dividend yield of 3.4% -- along with a fairly reasonable payout ratio of 79.2%. Many of Sanofi's dividend-paying peers, after all, offer substantially lower yields, but much higher payout ratios to boot. Most importantly, though, Sanofi has raised its payout for 23 consecutive years at this point, showing the company's deep commitment to doling out a top-notch dividend to its shareholders. Given Sanofi's strong product portfolio and upper-echelon dividend program, this top international biopharma stock appears to have all the ingredients necessary to be an attractive stock for retired investors on the hunt for relatively safe vehicles to grow their money.

232,"Travis Hoium, Tyler Crowe, and Brian Feroldi",8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Owning companies with durable businesses that pay high dividends can be a great way for investors to make money in the market long term. And sometimes there are great values among high-yield dividend stocks. We asked three of our investors for high-yield stocks they think are on sale, and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE:SKT), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) were at the top of the list. Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (Verizon): The telecommunications industry may be entering a new phase of growth with 5G networks starting to roll out across the country. And Verizon is leading the charge into the next generation of networks that will enable self-driving vehicles, virtual or augmented reality, and other new technologies. That opportunity for growth is why I think a stock trading at 16 times trailing earnings with a 4.8% dividend yield is on sale for investors. When a stock reaches a high dividend yield or a relatively low P/E ratio, it usually means a business' future is getting dimmer for some reason. Maybe it has fewer growth opportunities ahead or could be disrupted by new technologies or business innovations. And with T-Mobile and Sprint aggressively pursuing customers, I think the market is seeing some weakness in Verizon, but the company's massive network and the next generation of connected devices will drive a new phase of growth. Short term, I think the market is making too much of competition from smaller rivals and overlooking the massive network advantage Verizon has over the competition. That will become extremely important as 5G rolls out and Verizon is in prime position to profit. For investors, the deal they're getting on the stock with a 4.8% dividend yield won't last long if 5G is as fast as expected. Brian Feroldi (Tanger Factory Outlet Centers): Given the recent turmoil in the retail industry, it is understandable why the market has soured on shares of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers right now. Down 32% since the start of the year, it is clear that Wall Street believes that this company is in trouble. However, I think that this real estate investment trust's business model will still be able to thrive in the changing retail environment. That mismatch is providing savvy investors with a great chance to get in. Tanger is a REIT that operates 44 outlet shopping centers in the U.S. The company pioneered the outlet center concept in an effort to connect price-sensitive consumers with brand-name manufacturers looking for a way to unload unwanted inventory. What kind of brand-name companies are we talking about? Currently, Tangers' top five tenants are Gap, Ascena Retail Group (Ann Taylor, Dress Barn), Nike, Philips Van Heusen, and Ralph Lauren. Importantly, the company has no exposure to department stores, which is good since that's the group that's really struggling to adapt to the e-commerce threat. By staying focused on credit-worthy tenants and avoiding department stores, Tanger has been able to keep its occupancy rates above 95% for 24 straight years. It has also produced 55 consecutive quarters of same-center net operating income growth. These numbers clearly show that the company's business model thrives in nearly all economic environments. Looking ahead, I'm confident that outlet stores will remain popular middle ground for bargain-hunting consumers and brand-name companies alike for years to come. With a dividend yield of 5.7% that should consume about 56% of forecasted AFFO for the year, Tanger looks like a high-yield stock that is worthy of your attention. Tyler Crowe (Enterprise Products Partners): I'll admit that a company's stock trading at an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 14.4 doesn't exactly scream bargain stock. For natural gas pipeline company Enterprise Product Partners, though, that is looking like a great price for a stock that has a distribution yield of 6.7%. One of the reasons that Enterprise continuously trades at a premium valuation is that the company is an incredibly reliable business that has raised its payout to investors every quarter for 52 quarters in a row. The company's pipeline, storage, processing, and petrochemical manufacturing business is built to act like a toll road in that it charges a fee for its services, which insulates it from the ups and downs of commodity prices. According to the most recent investor presentation, more than 85% of its gross profits come from these fixed-fee contracts. Also, with a natural gas liquid logistics network that's connected to every ethylene manufacturing facility in the U.S., 90% of the oil refining capacity east of the Rockies, much of the petrochemical manufacturing facilities in the Gulf Coast, and several export terminals, Enterprise gives its customers an immense number of options to send products to the most profitable outlet at any given moment. EPD Dividend data by YCharts. On top of Enterprise's great business model, it has a top-notch management team that prudently invests in high-return projects that enhance that logistics network while maintaining a manageable balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. All of these elements are what have allowed management to keep raising its payout and why the market consistently assigns a premium valuation to its stock. At today's price, it's an incredibly attractive offer. ","

This also marks the 11th time in as many reports that the operational-intelligence platform specialist has beaten expectations. Let's have a closer look at what Splunk accomplished over the past few months. Image source: Splunk. Fiscal Q2 2018* Fiscal Q2 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $280.0 million $212.8 million 31.6% GAAP net income (loss) ($83.5 million) ($86.6 million) N/A GAAP earnings (loss) per share ($0.60) ($0.65) N/A Data source: Splunk. *For the quarter ended July 31,2017. Splunk CEO Doug Merritt stated: I am pleased with the solid sales execution in Q2, particularly our results in EMEA [Europe, the Middle East, and Africa]. As I traveled across Europe, Asia, and North America over the last two months, I was excited to see businesses, governments and universities adopting Splunk across multiple departments and use cases. Customer success and product innovation are at the heart of what we do. For the fiscal third quarter of 2018, Splunk expects revenue to be between $307 million and $309 million -- above the $306.9 million investors were anticipating -- with adjusted operating margin of 8%. As a result, Splunk once again increased its full fiscal-year 2018 guidance to call for billings of $1.450 billion, up from $1.425 billion previously, and revenue of between $1.210 billion and $1.215 billion, up from $1.195 billion previously. Splunk also reiterated its expectation for full fiscal-year adjusted operating margin of roughly 8%. All things considered -- and though it shouldn't be terribly surprising, given Splunk's propensity for under-promising and over-delivering -- there was nothing not to like about this report from an investor's perspective. Customers from a wide variety of industries continue to adopt Splunk's solutions in droves. And the company is translating that adoption to stellar revenue growth as its GAAP losses continue to narrow. With shares of Splunk down around 9% over the past three months in spite of its quarterly beat and raise in May, it was hard to blame the market for bidding up the stock after hours following the earnings release.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), the conglomerate led by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has a stock portfolio that contains nearly four dozen stock positions worth a total of $161.8 billion as of this writing. However, there is tremendous variation in the size of Berkshire's stock positions. For example, Berkshire's $44,748 worth of Verizon stock would be a large investment for most people, but it represents just 0.00003% of Berkshire's portfolio and is therefore not a very significant ""Buffett stock."" With that in mind, there are 22 billion-dollar common stock positions in Berkshire's portfolio. In order from largest to smallest, here's a list of the billion-dollar ""Buffett stocks"" -- and how you can use this data. Company Shares Berkshire Owns Recent Stock Price Value of Berkshire's Stake Kraft Heinz 325,634,818 $84.83 $27.62 billion Wells Fargo 467,987,270 $52.17 $24.41 billion Apple 130,191,960 $159.81 $20.81 billion Coca-Cola 400,000,000 $45.62 $18.24 billion American Express 151,610,700 $85.12 $12.91 billion International Business Machines 54,084,673 $134.15 $7.60 billion Phillips 66 80,689,892 $82.31 $6.64 billion U.S. Bancorp 85,063,167 $51.75 $4.40 billion Charter Communications 9,443,491 $397.47 $3.75 billion Moody's 24,669,778 $131.88 $3.25 billion Bank of New York Mellon 50,229,588 $52.68 $2.67 billion Southwest Airlines 47,659,456 $53.99 $2.57 billion Delta Air Lines 53,110,395 $47.80 $2.54 billion Goldman Sachs 10,959,519 $223.00 $2.44 billion DaVita 38,565,570 $56.70 $2.19 billion American Airlines 47,000,000 $45.78 $2.15 billion General Motors 60,000,000 $35.12 $2.11 billion Liberty SiriusXM 45,951,345 $43.50 $2.00 billion United Continental Holdings 28,211,563 $64.94 $1.83 billion Verisign 12,952,745 $99.73 $1.29 billion Visa 10,562,460 $103.27 $1.09 billion USG Corporation 39,002,016 $26.57 $1.04 billion Data source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings. Positions as of 6/30/2017, while prices and values are current as of 8/22/2017. One of the main things to notice from this data is just how top-heavy the portfolio is. While Berkshire's portfolio consists of 46 stocks, including the 22 billion-dollar positions in the chart, more than 56% of the entire portfolio's value is concentrated in just four stocks -- Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, Apple, and Coca-Cola. Image source: The Motley Fool. Also notice that while there are 22 stocks in the chart, there are a couple of groups of similarly focused companies. Berkshire's airline stocks are perhaps the most obvious example from the chart. By themselves, none of Berkshire's airline investments are large, relative to some of the portfolio's largest holdings. However, notice that Berkshire has similarly sized investments in the four largest U.S. airlines -- American, Delta, United Continental, and Southwest -- worth more than $9 billion combined. Financials are another group well represented on the list. In addition to top Berkshire holdings Wells Fargo and American Express, you'll find three more banks and a major credit card processor among Berkshire's billion-dollar stocks. In all, banks and credit card processors make up just under $50 billion of Berkshire's stock portfolio. No discussion of Berkshire's billion-dollar stock positions would be complete without mentioning Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Thanks to a savvy financial crisis-era investment, Berkshire received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank at a deeply discounted price. To make a long story short, Bank of America recently increased its quarterly dividend to a point where Buffett said he intended to exercise the warrants. However, Bank of America's capital plan was approved just days before the end of the second quarter, so the position has not been officially reported in Berkshire's SEC filings yet. Including Bank of America, Berkshire has 23 billion-dollar stock investments. And since 700 million shares of Bank of America are worth about $16.7 billion as of this writing, that means Berkshire's financial-sector stocks are worth nearly $67 billion altogether. In other words, it's fair to say that Berkshire's stock portfolio is highly dependent on the performance of the banking industry. I don't suggest buying or selling any stock simply because a billionaire has done the same -- even if that billionaire is named Warren Buffett. The more important lessons to learn are why Buffett likes each of these stocks and whether they fit your particular risk tolerance and investing goals. The bottom line is that while knowing what Warren Buffett owns can be a good starting point, it's still important to do your own research before buying any of the stocks on this list. ","

The $1.9 billion deal represents a 2 percent premium over Friday's closing stock price. The transaction is scheduled to close in the first half of 2018. The offer price is more than 25 percent higher than where BroadSoft shares were trading before Reuters reported Aug. 30 that the company was exploring a potential sale. Executives described the combination as a step to focus on group teleconferencing services, an expansion beyond the traditional routing hardware Cisco is best known for. Cisco has been building out its WebEx videoconferencing service for large businesses in recent years. ""We've seen firsthand how the agile workforce of today is transforming how work gets done, whether that's virtually, on the move or in their physical work environments,"" Cisco Senior Vice President Roland Acra said in a call with investors. ""Our customers expect the tools from Cisco that will enable them to continue that transition."" Cloud computing technology, and the often cheaper global calling and videoconferencing it enables, has been a significant opportunity for traditional telecommunications companies. Microsoft, one of Cisco's close competitors in the business conference-call space, recently announced that it would end its Skype for Business offering in favor of a new product called Microsoft Teams. Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011 when it was a market-dominating consumer videoconferencing app. Since then, the market for business-focused online collaboration tools has exploded, with companies such as Slack, Google and Facebook competing for market share. In a call with investors Monday, Cisco executives said the combination with BroadSoft would give the company a stronger hand as it competes with Microsoft. Microsoft has ""run into a brick wall with BroadSoft, frankly, at the lower end of their business,"" said Rowan Trollope, a senior vice president at Cisco. For BroadSoft, the deal brings one of the Washington area's biggest exits in recent memory. BroadSoft was founded in 1998 by two telecommunications executives and quickly built a software business targeting cable providers and phone carriers.

237,Reuters with CNBC.com,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"Cisco Systems, the worlds largest networking gear manufacturer, announced an agreement on Monday to acquire BroadSoft for $1.9 billion. Cisco said it would pay $55 per share, in cash.  BroadSoft shares had closed at $54.90 on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.67 billion. Shares opened about 1.5 percent higher on Monday after the deal was announced. The deal, which comes after Reuters first reported in August that BroadSoft was exploring a sale, allows Cisco to further diversify away from its stagnating switches and routers business by giving it a stronger foothold in selling unified communications software to big telecommunications firms. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC that the deal will help Cisco's enterprise clients and small businesses connect better with consumers. ""Every customer, when they think about their digital strategies, they think about how they interact with their customers,"" Robbins told ""Squawk on the Street."" ""This acquisition of BroadSoft actually gives us the most comprehensive set of collaboration solutions for our customers."" The BroadSoft deal would be Cisco's second major acquisition this year following the $3.7 billion acquisition of privately held AppDynamics in March. After the 2016 election, Robbins told CNBC that tax reform, particularly the repatriation of overseas cash, would prompt Cisco to look into mergers and acquisitions. Cisco's latest deal comes as there is mounting pressure on Capitol Hill to pass a budget and focus on tax cuts. When asked on Monday, Robbins told CNBC that the prospect of tax reform did not impact the timing of the BroadSoft deal. ""To date, we have not had any deals that we have considered that we have delayed, or put on hold, because of waiting on repatriation,"" Robbins said. ""Obviously we remain very optimistic about tax reform, and are hopeful that something will happen late this year or early in 2018."" With its traditional business of making switches and routers seeing revenue declines, Cisco, like other legacy technology firms, has been focusing on high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, BroadSoft provides software and services that enable mobile, fixed-line and cable service providers to offer unified communications over their internet protocol networks. BroadSoft has historically sold its products to large telecommunications companies such as Verizon Communications and AT&T, which then resell the software to their business customers. BroadSoft has recently tried to revamp its business model to sell directly to these customers, a move that risks its relationships with its telecommunications partners, according to a Barclays Plc research report. New York-based hedge fund P2 Capital Partners owned a 4.6 percent stake in BroadSoft as of the end of June, according to Thomson Reuters data. P2 has often behaved as an activist shareholder and has even offered to buy companies in which it has invested. Another BroadSoft shareholder with a history of acquisitions is buyout firm KKR, which is BroadSofts 13th-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data.

238,Michael Sheetz,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"General Electric reported third-quarter earnings that were barely half of what Wall Street expected, and its new CEO did not shy away from the miss. ""The results I'm about to share with you are completely unacceptable,"" CEO John Flannery said on a conference call with investors Friday, where he telegraphed that big changes were ahead. ""We are focusing heavily on the culture of the company,"" Flannery said. ""Things will not stay the same at GE."" The company is in the process of finalizing its 2018 financial outlook and says it will unveil those projections and any changes to its dividend in November. As part of that process, the company is reviewing sources of cash in this year and next. In the third quarter, GE's cash flow from operating activities fell 78 percent from a year ago, to $4.1 billion. Flannery said every aspect of the large, traditionally bureaucratic company will be scrutinized, from what businesses it owns and invests in to the processes it uses to make decisions to its management practices. ""Everything is on the table and there are no sacred cows,"" Flannery said. GE's strong dividend is a top concern for investors, and Flannery made no promises, saying there are ""moving pieces"" to consider. ""The dividend is a priority in our capital allocation framework and we understand its importance to our investor base,"" said Flannery, who replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO in August. The company's current annual dividend gives a yield of 4.1 percent, the second-highest among Dow companies behind Verizon Communications. Extensive cost cutting is also ahead, with the company now seeking to slice $2 billion in costs next year, up from a prior target of $1 billion. Flannery's comments appeared to resonate well with investors. Although the stock was down as much as 8 percent prior to the conference call, shares recouped losses and were down more than 2 percent in active trading. After stripping out restructuring charges, GE earned 29 cents per share from continuing operations in the third quarter, down 9 percent from the period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn 49 cents per share. The earnings miss reported by GE was the company's biggest in at least the last 17 years, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Prior to Friday's report, the company's biggest miss relative to Wall Street expectations was just 7 cents in April 2008, according to Bespoke's Paul Hickey.

Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) third quarter was its chance to prove what it's been saying for several quarters now is true. Management said it expected service revenue, which decreased for the 11th straight quarter in the second quarter, would start to show improvements in the second half of this year. Sure enough, Verizon showed an improvement in its service revenue, climbing about 1.4% sequentially in the third quarter from the second quarter low. The turnaround was helped by a net addition of 274,000 postpaid phone subscribers. That's the second straight quarter where Verizon has added postpaid phone subscribers after several quarters of declining results. The trend coincides with Verizon's decision to join competitors like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) in offering an unlimited wireless data plan. Management also noted it expects the trend to continue in the fourth quarter. Image source: Verizon. Competitive pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint resulted in Verizon losing a lot of postpaid phone subscribers and offering lower-priced plans to retain its existing customers. Combined with pressure from the switch from subsidized smartphone contracts to equipment installment plans -- where device and service billing are separated -- resulted in an extended decline in service revenue. The good news for Verizon investors is that the last two quarters show several promising signs on all fronts. First of all, T-Mobile is becoming less aggressive as it's starting to focus on growing cash flow. A successful merger with Sprint would further lower competitive pressure, but significant hurdles still remain for the two companies to join forces. Second, the percentage of Verizon's phone activations and customers on device payment plans has stabilized over the last four quarters. Forty-nine percent of Verizon subscribers are on a device payment plan and 77% of new activations are on a payment plan. Those numbers have been relatively flat over the past year. Thus, the pressure from the shift to service-only contracts appears to be over. Perhaps the most promising trend is the return to growth in postpaid phone subscribers, which contribute much more in service revenue than connected devices. Verizon's unlimited plan is to thank, as management made clear in its first-quarter earnings call. Before introducing the unlimited plan, Verizon had lost nearly 400,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the first six weeks of the first quarter. It ended up losing just 289,000 that quarter, and it's added 358,000 and 274,000 in the subsequent quarters. Naturally, more customers mean more service revenue. While service revenue is starting to head in the right direction, Verizon's cost of services is also increasing. In fact, cost of services was up 2.8% sequentially from the fourth quarter, growing twice as fast as service revenue. The increase in cost of services likely stems from the unlimited plan as well. The new plan puts a strain on Verizon's network, especially considering the early adopters of the new plan are most likely to take full advantage of their new freedom to use as much data as they like. Verizon has already shown signs that its network is having trouble keeping up with the demand for data. Verizon recently introduced a lower-tier unlimited data plan, which throttles video quality down and restricts speeds when using the phone to connect to the internet through another device. The move puts its plan and pricing nearly in line with T-Mobile's, and it should help reduce cost of services. The line item will be one for investors to continue to monitor alongside continued increases in service revenue. If the growth in revenue doesn't eventually start outpacing the costs to provide that service, it's not doing a whole lot of good for investors. ","

Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the largest consumer wireless service provider in the United States. It also owns a wireline business, providing phone, internet, and video service to the home, as well as a digital media business called Oath, combining the assets of Yahoo! and AOL. The vast majority of its revenue and earnings come from its wireless business, where it faces intense competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T). As T-Mobile and Sprint make moves to win over customers, they have chipped away at the industry economics that have benefited Verizon and AT&T. That's leaving some investors wondering whether Verizon stock is a buy. Image source: Verizon. As the largest wireless service provider, Verizon benefits greatly from economies of scale. While Verizon charges some of the highest prices for its service in the industry, its cost of providing that service per subscriber is actually one of the lowest. As a result it consistently reports the largest wireless EBITDA margin in the industry. Verizon's scale also protects it against future entrants into the industry. Building out a wireless network requires substantial upfront costs. There are also barriers to obtaining the wireless spectrum necessary to operate a wireless service. Considering these barriers, the threat of a new competitor entering the space in earnest is low. Companies like Comcast and Charter are actually using Verizon's network to launch their own wireless services instead of trying to enter the market on their own. Verizon also has a strong brand and network. That gives it some pricing power, but improvements in T-Mobile's network combined with its aggressive pricing have cut into Verizon's ability to charge a premium. Verizon is still, in my opinion, the best-positioned wireless carrier in a hyper-competitive market. Verizon's third-quarter earnings report gave a few reasons to be optimistic about the company's future. First of all, Verizon added over 250,000 net postpaid phone subscribers for the second quarter in a row. That reverses a trend of poor or negative net adds over the last couple years. That also shows the strength of Verizon's brand and network in both retaining existing subscribers and attracting new ones. More importantly, Verizon has started to turn around its falling wireless service revenue. The amount Verizon brought in from service contracts last quarter increased for the first time in three years, and management said the trend will continue in the fourth quarter. That said, service revenue is still falling year over year, but should start to show improvements as soon as next year. Verizon is a strong company and its operations are moving in the right direction, but whether or not the stock is a buy ultimately comes down to what investors have to pay for it. Here's how the four major wireless companies stack up in terms of valuation. Company Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.8 T-Mobile 7.4 Sprint 5.6 With an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.9, Verizon appears to be fairly valued. It's trading for the same multiple as AT&T, its closest competitor. Considering AT&T's massive investment in the pay-TV industry and its declining postpaid phone subscriber base, I think Verizon's growth prospects are actually better than AT&T's and should earn it a higher multiple. Meanwhile, T-Mobile trades for a slightly higher EV-to-EBITDA ratio. It probably deserves a higher multiple than Verizon due to its rapid growth. The opposite is true for Sprint, and it's reflected in its depressed price. As such, Verizon appears fairly valued on an EV-to-EBITDA ratio. For investors looking to get into the wireless industry, it presents a good buy right now. I'll be holding onto my own shares for the foreseeable future. ","

Shares of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are rallying after reporting a strong showing in the third quarter of 2017. While all the focus is rightly directed at the company's wireless subscriber base, there is more going on behind the scenes that make this stock an exciting long-term investment. Data by YCharts. Verizon's stock has underperformed the market this year as investors have fretted over the business foundation: Wireless subscribers. However, due in large part to the rollout of unlimited data plans to keep up with smaller competitors like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Verizon is back in subscriber growth mode with 603,000 net adds in the third quarter. Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings. Highlights from the quarter also included the Fios division, Verizon's video and internet service, growing revenue by 4.8%. The AOL and Yahoo! media divisions, reorganized as the Oath brand, had revenue of $2 billion. Management said the full integration of the two online media companies was ahead of schedule. Over the last few years, Verizon has been quietly acquiring small Internet of Things (IoT) businesses and organizing them into a new operating segment. Organic revenue growth, which excludes any bump from acquisitions made in the last year, was up 13% in the third quarter. Period Telematics Revenue YoY IoT Organic % Growth Q1 2017 $214 million 17% Q2 2017 $220 million 20% Q3 2017 More than $220 million 13% Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings. The company can be a bit cryptic in explaining this small department, giving revenue figures for telematics -- the connected vehicle and fleet management businesses -- but only giving revenue growth percentages for the IoT division overall, which includes telematics. Telematics growth has seemingly stalled after Verizon bought its way into the industry last year. With annualized revenue of just under $900 million, the company has cut a small piece of the market share pie, estimated to be at just over $7 billion this year. However, estimates say the industry will grow to over $18 billion by 2022. That makes this currently insignificant Verizon segment something to pay attention to. The overall IoT segment is fuzzy with only an overall percentage to work with. What we do know is that Verizon has made a handful of small purchases ranging from connected commercial lighting to smart city businesses. The figure likely includes Verizon's work on the future 5G network, which is now being pilot testing in select urban markets. An announcement was made earlier in the week that partner Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) will begin testing its hardware on Verizon's 5G network in 2018, with the expectation that 5G modems will begin shipping for commercial use in early 2019. Image source: Getty Images. While wireless subscriptions continue to be the primary focus for investors, Verizon is ramping up its future business and finding ways to monetize it even now. The future 5G network, which touts faster speeds and lower latency time, will do more than provide a faster network for smartphone users. It will be the network that powers the future of technology growth. What that means is that Verizon is positioning itself as something more than an enabler of mobile phones. 5G will carry the information needed to power the IoT: autonomous vehicles, connected healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities. The quarter was a win because of the strong addition of new wireless subscribers, but for me this stock is all about the progressive rollout of that small IoT business segment. ","

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported third-quarter results on Oct. 23, and the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier furthered its assault on industry titans Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $10.019 billion $9.305 billion 8% Net income $550 million $366 million 50% Earnings per share $0.63 $0.42 50% Data source: T-Mobile Q3 2017 earnings release. T-Mobile added 1.3 million net new customers, which helped its total subscriber count top 70.7 million by the end of the third quarter. Of those new customers, 817,000 were of the postpaid variety, including 595,000 net postpaid phone customers. Postpaid subscribers pay monthly bills and are typically the most valuable customers for wireless carriers. T-Mobile continues to use innovative promotions to fuel its customer growth. In September, it announced that its family plans will now include a free Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscription. Image Source: T-Mobile US. In the press release announcing the deal, the company stated: T-Mobile has completely disrupted wireless, and Netflix has totally disrupted entertainment. What happens when you bring two disruptors together? Get ready to find out! Well, early evidence suggests that what happens is more people become customers of T-Mobile and, ostensibly, Netflix. Better still, the Netflix promotion may also be helping T-Mobile retain more of its existing customers, as postpaid phone churn improved by 9 basis points year over year. All told, T-Mobile's customer growth drove an 8% year-over-year increase in total revenue, to $10 billion. In turn, EBITDA -- adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, spectrum gains, and certain other items -- rose 5% to $2.8 billion. CEO John Legere, in his typical unabashed style, praised T-Mobile's performance in its earnings release: Just step back and look at these financial results -- they're incredible! Record service revenues, record free cash flow, record Q3 adjusted EBITDA -- and that's on top of 18 quarters in a row with more than one million customers added. We're delivering results that no one else can match and have proven time and time again that we know how to fight for customers and win for shareholders. We won't stop! Legere may be more flamboyant than the average CEO, but T-Mobile continues to back up his bold statements. T-Mobile raised its 2017 full-year subscriber growth forecast to between 3.3 million and 3.6 million branded postpaid net additions, up from 3.0 million to 3.6 million. It also increased its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $10.8 billion to $11.0 billion, up from a range of $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion. Notably, T-Mobile declined to conduct its usual conference call with analysts after its earnings release. In a question-and-answer document (opens a PDF) posted to its investor-relations website, the company stated: Our incredible Q3 results speak for themselves! We want to keep the focus on those results, without letting them be drowned out by the rumors that have been swirling around. As it relates to those rumors, we've got nothing to share. The rumors T-Mobile is referring to are recent reports that it will merge with No. 4 U.S wireless carrier Sprint (NYSE:S). Such a deal could make the combined company an even more formidable foe to current industry leaders Verizon and AT&T. However, even if T-Mobile and Sprint were to agree to a merger, regulators would probably give it heavy scrutiny. Regardless, with another quarter of what's expected to be industry-leading customer gains, T-Mobile continues to expand its share of the massive U.S. wireless industry. ","

High yields and low stock prices often go hand in hand. That's just the mathematical nature of dividend yield calculations -- cheap shares and generous payouts add up to juicy yields. But some of these high-yield shares are cheap for good reason, and extreme yields are often red flags marking a troubled business and a bad investment. One way to avoid the worst high-yield offenders is to check with the experts, who can point you to high-quality businesses that also love returning cash to their shareholders. So we rounded up a few of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool and asked for some advice. Read on to see how our panelists arrived at telecom giants Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), plus telecom infrastructure specialist Uniti Group (NASDAQ:UNIT). Image source: Getty Images. Keith Noonan (AT&T): With its hefty dividend and underappreciated growth prospects, AT&T is an undervalued income play that's worth holding for the long term. It's worth looking at why the company's stock can currently be had for cheap. On the wireless service side of things, value-priced competitors including Sprint and T-Mobile have caught up to AT&T's 4G network -- reducing the appeal of ""premium"" service. The result is a pricing war that's causing AT&T to lose subscribers and take margin hits to offer more competitive service, but the company's advantage in wireless should re-emerge with the expansion of 5G networks. The rollout will be a capital-intensive endeavor, but 5G will be at the center of the Internet of Things and other next-gen communication technologies, so the opportunity extends far beyond mobile service. The company's pending acquisition of Time Warner, which seems to be on track to be approved, is another reason to like the stock. As tech companies are scrambling to build their content offerings and bolster their respective ecosystems, AT&T has made a promising play for one of the world's top entertainment conglomerates. If the deal goes through, AT&T will be in position to offer wireless television packages that competitors will be hard pressed to match and also make Time Warner's advertising business much more profitable, thanks to the advantages of digital ad targeting over cable distribution. With AT&T's roughly 5.4% dividend yield and a 33-year history of delivering annual payout increases, you won't find many companies offering a better returned income component in the technology and telecom sectors. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 12 looks like a bargain in today's frothy market. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): Verizon endured a rough first half of 2017, after increasing competition led to its first-ever postpaid wireless subscriber decline to kick off the new fiscal year. But the telecommunications juggernaut quickly fixed the situation by launching new unlimited-data plans the following quarter. Just last week, Verizon followed up by demonstrating continued wireless momentum in adding 603,000 retail postpaid accounts in Q3, and maintaining healthy retail postpaid churn of 0.75%. At the same time, Verizon's service revenue declined 5.1% year over year. But its trends to that end are improving; service revenue grew on a sequential basis last quarter for the first time in three years, and Verizon expects to exit 2017 with a year-over-year service revenue decline of under 4%. Meanwhile, last month, Verizon boosted its quarterly dividend for the 11th straight year, bringing its annual yield at today's prices to roughly 4.8%. With shares still down around 9% year to date and trading at just 12.7 times forward earnings, Verizon is an enticing bet for investors willing to buy stock now and watch the business continue to improve. Image source: Getty Images. Anders Bylund (Uniti Group): The former networking infrastructure arm of regional telecom Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) sports a current dividend yield of 16%. Generous sharing of the real estate investment trust's cash flows is one half of   the yield equation. On the other side, Uniti's share prices have fallen 47% lower over the past 52 weeks, thus driving the effective yield that much higher. The stock is suffering under terrible results from Windstream, and many investors fear that Uniti's largest client may go bankrupt soon. These fears are not unreasonable -- Windstream recently canceled its own high-yield dividend policy altogether, in an effort to shore up its unstable balance sheet and negative free cash flows. Windstream may indeed make an exit, stage left, at any time. Yet I am confident enough in Uniti's value to own that stock, even as I'm predicting a dire end to the company's largest customer. I'm convinced that Windstream spun out its most valuable asset to create Uniti. The long-haul network manages 4.8 million strand miles of network fiber and 468 wireless towers, boasts a far stronger balance sheet, generates cash while Windstream is burning it, and is actively looking to distance itself from Windstream. Uniti started its young standalone life in 2015 with just one client, and you already know who. Since then, a campaign of smaller network buyouts and an active client-hunting project has expanded the customer list to 16,000 names. That list includes high-quality clients such as the U.S. Department of Defense, several nationwide telecoms not named Windstream, and a few cable TV broadcasters. Furthermore, the long-term lease agreement between Windstream and Uniti was structured to preserve the contract terms in the event of a bankruptcy. If worse comes to worst, Windstream's bankruptcy would cause some temporary uncertainty and delayed payments, but whoever picks up the fallen company's assets for pennies on the dollar will end up honoring the terms of Windstream's original agreement. I'm no lawyer, but there's legal precedent for so-called favorable lease terms surviving Chapter 11 filings. Maybe I'm underestimating the risks here, but Uniti remains a useful and promising part of my retirement portfolio. At these bargain-bin prices, maybe you should start a Uniti position, too.

Don't show this again Moves by rivals AT&T and T-Mobile raise the question of whether Verizon needs to offer a video perk, even as customers flock back to its unlimited plan. Verizon remains surprisingly resilient, adding 603,000 retail postpaid  customers in the third quarter. AT&T dangles HBO and the promise of ""Game of Thrones"" when you sign up. T-Mobile throws in Netflix for its family plan customers. Where's the Verizon entertainment bundle? The New York telecommunications company has waded into the media world with its acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo, but those deals are more about delivering advertisements, not video. It also has an investment in digital media company AwesomenessTV, which has a following among younger viewers. Then there's Go90, a free mobile video service -- that hardly anyone watches. That puts Verizon at a disadvantage if you happen to be looking for some sort of media throw-in with your plan. And let's face it, you're spending more of your time on your phone watching video. Consumers on average spend nearly half an hour each day watching videos on their phones, according to media agency Zenith. Just wait until the second season of ""Stranger Things"" comes out. Video has become the latest weapon in the carriers' battle for your business. Yet even as things stand, Verizon remains surprisingly resilient, adding 603,000 retail postpaid customers -- or people who pay at the end of the month and generally have higher bills and stick around longer -- in the third quarter. That follows a rebound in the second quarter that was helped by the reintroduction of an unlimited-data plan. As such, Verizon CFO Matt Ellis doesn't believe the company needs to throw in any video perks. He noted the still low customer turnover rate (known in the industry as churn). ""We can have good churn without bundling any offering,"" he said on a conference call with investors on Thursday. Verizon's postpaid growth got some help from the addition of 91,000 new tablets and 238,000 new wearables and other connected devices. The company added a net 274,000 new phone customers in the period. Beyond video, the extras have flown fast and furious. Sprint offers a year of service for free (excluding taxes and fees), and its prepaid arm Virgin Mobile boasts an all-iPhone lineup with a rate of $1 for the first year of service. In addition to the bundling of free HBO, AT&T offers its DirecTV Now streaming video service at a discount when bundled with a phone plan. The lack of an online video service is hitting Verizon's home entertainment business. The company lost 18,000 Fios video connections, although it added 66,000 Fios internet connections. Many traditional pay TV providers are starting to feel the sting of competitive online video offers and the rise of ""cord-cutters"" who ignore traditional cable in favor of streaming video. Verizon is considering its own full-blown video-streaming service, comparable to DirecTV Now or Sling TV, CEO Lowell McAdam told Bloomberg last month. Ellis, speaking on the call, said that Verizon doesn't want to launch a me-too product and that it would continue to look for ways to offer a different product built around live programming. ""How and when is still TBD,"" he said. For now, the unlimited data offer seems to be keeping things stable. Verizon reported a third-quarter net profit of $3.7 billion, or 89 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it earned 98 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.5 percent to $31.7 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 98 cents a share and revenue of $31.45 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. Verizon shares rose 2.4 percent to $49.80 in premarket trading.

248,Austen Hufford,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 19, 2017 8:52 a.m. ET By Verizon Communications Inc. gained wireless subscribers in the latest quarter, as the telecommunications company worked to shore up its largest unit in light of its weakening television business. Verizon reported a net increase of 603,000 retail postpaid connections in its third quarter, including 274,000 phone subscribers. The company had 115.3 million total wireless retail connections, up from 113.7 million the same quarter last year and 114.5 million in the second quarter. The company's revenue beat Wall Street expectations while meeting analysts' estimates on profit. Verizon shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading Thursday. Earlier this year, Verizon, the nation's largest wireless carrier by subscribers, unexpectedly brought back its unlimited wireless plans for the first time since 2011. The unlimited plans allow customers pay a flat rate for nearly unlimited monthly internet usage on their smartphones. In its latest quarter, the company continued to increase the percentage of its total subscriber base that were on smartphones and using high-speed wireless internet. Revenue from the wireless business, Verizon's largest, fell 2.4% to $21.58 billion, as the switch to unlimited plans continued to weigh on service revenue. Still, the company said service revenue trends were improving and had increased from the second quarter. Revenue at the wireline segment that includes its Fios service grew 1.1% to $7.66 billion, boosted by its acquisition of XO Communications. Analysts are closely awaiting the release of Apple Inc.'s latest phones, including the premium iPhone X. If popular, the new phones could drive more customers to upgrade at Verizon but rivals could also grab customers away with discounts. Still, promotions around the latest iPhone have been softer than in previous years. Verizon cited ongoing consumer shifts to over-the-top video options and away from traditional television as the reason for losing 18,000 Fios video customers in the quarter. That is more that the loss of 15,000 in the second quarter and 13,000 in the first quarter. It gained 36,000 in the third quarter last year. In all, Verizon profit was the same as the third quarter last year, with net income of $3.62 billion, or 89 cents a share. Revenue grew 2.5% to $31.72 billion. Still, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue fell 2.3%. On an adjusted-basis, earnings per share was 98 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected adjusted per-share profit of 98 cents on $31.45 billion in revenue. As a mature business in a saturated market, Verizon is increasingly looking to increase profits through spending cuts. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in September that the company is aiming to cut $10 billion in costs over the next four years by moving to zero-base budgeting. Verizon expects capital spending for 2017 to be at the lower end of its $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion range. During the quarter Verizon, which is the new parent company of Yahoo, said that a massive data breach at Yahoo in 2013 was far more extensive than previously disclosed, affecting all of its 3 billion user accounts. Verizon also announced that it would shut the groundbreaking and once-popular AOL instant messenger service later this year. On Thursday, the company said the integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of internal expectations.

                                   position is of that same size. “We added GE several months ago with the expectation that new management would lead a slow but steady turnaround, and that the market had largely discounted a likely earnings cut and reset,” wrote Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s equity model portfolio team. He said that “at the time” the company was added to the portfolio, “we saw the dividend as secure.” GE’s quarterly results, however, indicated much worse cash flow statistics than the investment bank expected, and “given substantially worse fundamental trends. particularly in light of more positive trends in several of GE’s segments including aerospace and healthcare,” it could no longer justify keeping the stock in the portfolio. “We believe the stock may continue to weaken around a potential dividend cut,” it wrote to clients. Don’t miss: GE’s stock is in breach of an unwritten rule for Dow members On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Coe downgraded GE to underweight, a bearish view that contributed to the stock’s recent selling pressure. Shares of GE are down 9.7% this week alone, and they have sunk about 32% in 2017. While GE didn’t announce a cut in its payout when it released results last week, investors fear it may do so on Nov. 13, when it is expected to outline a path to recovery following years of share-price underperformance, as seen in the FactSet chart below, which compares GE (red) against the S&P 500 (green) over a 15-year time horizon. “There does need to be a balance of investing in growth, organic and inorganic growth, and the dividend payout. So as a philosophy, expect a balance. We’ll present this framework in November as we complete the 2017 and 2018 process,” said newly installed Chief Executive John Flannery on the post-results conference call with analysts. GE pays a quarterly dividend of 24 cents a share, which at current levels amounts to a yield of 4.48%.

251,Austen Hufford,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 7:14 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp. suffered its largest quarterly loss of cable television subscribers in three years, underscoring the pressure on traditional TV players as competition with new entrants heats up. The cable giant's results for the September quarter come after AT&T Inc. said Tuesday that it was continuing to lose its most profitable pay-TV viewers. The traditional pay TV providers are competing with new, more affordable online channel bundles, as well as streaming services like Netflix Inc., which are luring away subscribers. Despite such concerns, Comcast on Thursday reported higher-than-expected profits per share as well as adjusted revenue growth. In the cable TV business, the company lost 125,000 residential and business customers, compared with a gain of 32,000 in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, Comcast lost 34,000 residential and business video customers. The company, like AT&T, believes the spate of major hurricanes in the quarter contributed to the subscriber losses. Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast gained 214,000 internet customers in the quarter, down from the 330,000 gained in the year-ago period. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 2.1% to $151.51. Comcast lost 94,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 2,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 62% of the top line, rose 5.1% to $13.2 billion. This year Comcast launched a new wireless cellphone service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue and profits had tough comparisons to last year, when the company's networks aired the 2016 Olympic Games. Revenue in the division fell 13% to $8.01 billion, with declines in both the broadcast television and cable networks divisions. When the impact of the Games was stripped out, revenue increased 6%. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division fell 0.5% as there were no megahits in the quarter. Still, the company's release of ""Despicable Me 3"" highlighted its focus on growing the size of its franchise business, which provides revenue beyond a movie's theater run. Theme parks revenue increased 7.7%, driven by new attractions in Japan and Orlando, Fla. In all, net income rose to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share, up from $2.24 billion, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share came in at 52 cents. Revenue fell 1.6% to $20.98 billion but adjusted revenue, excluding the impact of the Olympics, grew 5.8%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share on $21.04 billion in revenue.

252, ,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"In a shift away from its quickly eroding linear satellite segment, AT&T has a new Android TV-powered DirecTV set-top box in the works that abandons satellite connectivity for internet-connected streaming. Variety uncovered a new FCC filing in which AT&T details the new device, which goes by the model number C71KW-400. In the documents AT&T describes the device as “the new AT&T/DirecTV Wireless 4K OTT Client.” According to the user manual accompanied in the files, the device can’t be used with the DirecTV’s existing Genie Servers. The manual also shows that a voice remote will be shipped with the set-top box. The device comes equipped with Ethernet connectivity, digital audio, and HDMI and USB ports, but no antenna or satellite connection, so it will connect only to the internet. The filings also reveal the device is based on Google’s Android TV operating system, and screenshots of YouTube and Google Play running on the device were included in the manual. It appears users will be able to download apps compatible with Android TV such as HBO Now, Hulu, and Netflix. AT&T is moving toward OTT delivery as its pay-TV satellite business is deteriorating. On Tuesday the operator reported linear satellite customer losses of 251,000 during the third quarter. The DirecTV subscriber base shrunk by 0.8 percent since the end of the third quarter last year, which is notably the first time the platform has ever seen year-over-year subscriber losses. In its third quarter earnings report, AT&T also revealed it gained 296,000 subscribers for its internet-based DirecTV Now offering, which now has about 787,000 subscribers.

253,Maria Armental,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 24, 2017 6:35 p.m. ET By AT&T Inc.'s shrinking traditional TV subscription and wireless phone businesses continued to take a toll on the telecommunications giant's financial performance in the latest period. Shares, which Tuesday set a 52-week low, fell 1% to $34.45 in after-hours trading as results missed expectations. The Dallas-based company has made a big push in media and entertainment as its core wireless business stalled. Already the largest domestic pay-television operator following its acquisition of satellite company DirecTV, AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film and TV studio. The deal, under regulatory review, is expected to close by year's end. AT&T said the number of subscribers to its video services fell by 89,000 in the quarter ended Sept. 30, as customers abandoned its fiber-optic-video and satellite-TV services. The decline, the third quarterly drop in a row, came despite 296,000 new accounts on its DirecTV Now service, which streams channels over the internet. DirecTV Now ended the quarter with 787,000 subscribers. The country's No. 2 wireless company posted a net loss of 97,000 postpaid phone subscribers, those who are billed monthly and tend to be more profitable. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had projected a loss of 126,000 phone subscribers. Including other devices, AT&T added 117,000 postpaid wireless customers. The company ended the quarter with 138.8 million U.S. wireless subscribers. Verizon Communications Inc., the largest domestic carrier by subscribers, last week said it had added 603,000 postpaid wireless connections in the third quarter. Meanwhile, T-Mobile US Inc. said Monday it had added 1.3 million subscribers in the third quarter, including 817,000 postpaid subscribers. The monthly cancellation rate -- or churn -- for mainstream wireless customers, edged up to 1.07%, from 1.05%, driven by cancellations among tablet users. Looking at phones alone, the cancellation rate was 0.84%, compared with 0.90% in the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter profit fell 9% to $3 billion, or 49 cents a share. Excluding merger and integration costs and other items, profit was 74 cents a share. Revenue fell 3% to $39.67 billion. Excluding lost business because of hurricanes and earthquakes, revenue would have been $39.8 billion, the company said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected profit of 63 cents a share, or 75 cents as adjusted, on $40.10 billion in revenue. The company's Latin American operations helped improve those results, adding $6.05 billion in operating revenue, up 13% from a year earlier, driven by the Mexican wireless business.

                                   is heavily dependent on its phone sales, a fact that allows investors to learn more from the financial data. The company will announce earnings just after launching preorders for its new $1,000 smartphone, the iPhone X. The forecast issued by the world’s most highly valued company could be the most important number released by a technology company this earnings season, as it could suggest how many of the expensive phones Apple expects to sell and deliver in the holiday season. Here’s what to pay attention to: Apple Apple lives and dies with its iPhone sales. This year, along with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, the company also unveiled the iPhone X for $999, the highest price Apple has charged to date. “It’s an obvious departure from where things have gone in the past,” said Dawson. “It’s a new price tier and Apple is now firmly in the superpremium space with the iPhone X.” Since Apple launched two new iPhones in late September, early orders and some results may be visible in the company’s financial statements, which will be released Nov. 2. But the forecast is what investors should watch, since it will be the most clear indication of current iPhone 8 sales, as well as potentially offering insight into the number of consumers that are holding off for the iPhone X. Also, speculation about delays in manufacturing have persisted, which means the forecast will give investors some idea of how many phones the company can actually deliver. Read also: Apple stock could get a trillion-dollar tailwind from Trump’s tax reforms, says RBC “The big question is that—can they meet demand?” Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin said. “Investors are going to want to know if they’re going to be able to mass manufacture this phone. If there is a manufacturing hiccup making a particular part, that’s an open question.” Alphabet At its Oct. 4 launch event, the internet company effectively doubled down on its hardware bet, unveiling two new Pixel phones, a smaller version of its Home speaker designed to compete with the Echo Dot from Amazon, and many other gadgets. Aside from Apple, the products are the only full, cohesive suite of computing devices available from a single U.S. company, and the main selling point is that Google is able to leverage its gains in artificial intelligence through the hardware. Opinion: The biggest laggard of the FAANG stocks is now breaking out However, because Google’s hardware revenue is lumped into a sales category called “Google Other revenues”—which also includes Google’s cloud-computing division, YouTube Red subscriptions and app revenue—it is impossible to gauge Google hardware sales from its earnings report. Beyond any color Alphabet executives provide, which they typically avoid, investors will likely have to wait for third-party research to gain meaningful insight into the success of the Pixel and Google’s other gadgets. “We’ll get no explicit guidance,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said. “In general, I would expect Pixels will sell slightly better than last year, but because they’re tied to Verizon Communication Inc.

                                   sales will be constrained. It’s the same issue as with the last announcement of Pixel phones.” Alphabet is set to report results Oct. 26. Amazon The company’s line of Echo speakers, powered by virtual assistant Alexa, is essentially Amazon’s iPhone—a new type of device that becomes popular with users and synonymous with the company that made it as rivals seek to catch up. Amazon is treating it with that type of importance, putting 5,000 people to work on the Alexa product line and spending $5.5 billion on “technology and content” research-and-development to develop new Echo devices introduced at a Sept. 27 launch event. “Amazon is transitioning itself into a consumer-facing hardware company, doubling down on the overall strategy on consumers,” Bajarin said. “Through its hardware endpoints in the smart home and voice assistant, it will have a regular touch point with the customer that’s not a shopping page, via a smart speaker and perhaps a screen.” Don’t miss: How winning the race for Amazon’s ‘HQ2’ could turn out to be a curse Like Google, Amazon logs its device sales within a much, much larger category, so it will be difficult to deduce early sales from the numbers alone when the company reports results on Oct. 26. It’s also worth considering that the launch event was just days before the end of the quarter. Echo devices are recorded in the “retail sales” section of “net sales” in Amazon’s supplemental financial information. Last quarter, that bucket of revenue was $23.75 billion, of which a fraction was Echo devices. As a result, commentary and third-party research will likely be more useful. Fitbit In late August, Fitbit previewed its long-awaited competitor to Apple’s line of smartwatches. Priced at $300 and called Ionic, the mixed reviews suggest that it is not the Apple Watch killer the company needed to break out from its core base of cheaper, fitness-focused wearables. “I think it’s in a really challenging place strategically,” Dawson said. “Fitbit needed to go upmarket, but now they’re competing head-on against Apple. They’ve gone from a position of having the market to themselves to going up against one of the biggest companies in the industry with a subpar product.” Since the company’s sales are based on its hardware products—including the Ionic—Fitbit’s guidance will give bigger clues about its expectations for the Ionic, which went on sale Oct. 1, the beginning of the quarter. The company has not yet said when it will report earnings. The rest Roku launched a new streaming device lineup on Oct. 2, though the company says that it views hardware as a customer acquisition strategy and it is not trying to “maximize for player revenue.” When the company went public, executives said the future of Roku sales are in its software, or platform, business, but they should still offer guidance for the new devices in the company’s first earnings report since going public.

255,Max A. Cherney,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Popular stock indicator presents risks to investors due to how its 30 stocks are weighted. Adobe Stock The “Dow” is hitting new highs with regularity.  That sounds good to casual market observers.  Heck, every week I hear about someone who does not know or care about the stock market telling their friends about how the Dow just crossed a certain level, and that its doing great in general.  That’s true in fact, but there is more to it, unless you just want to rest on your laurels and ignore a major risk that is inherent in tracking the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the favorite market proxy for decades before the S&P 500, once considered a gauge monitored by professional investors only, started to replace the Dow in notoriety.  As I have written and shown in past articles, the S&P 500 is a terrible proxy for the stock market as we get later into a bull market cycle, but as it turns out, the Dow is even worse.  A while back, I alerted you to the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a very oddball formula to determine how much influence each of its 30 component stocks has on the overall index.  The allocation, or weighting of each of the stocks in the index is simply a function of the dollar price of each stock.  Why is that an issue?  Because the price of a stock is not a valuation measure.  If one stock is selling at $100 a share and another at $50 a share, that tells you nothing about where it has been, what its earnings trend is, or anything else that might be of value to an investor who actually cares to know what they own. This creates a false sense of what you are following when you follow the Dow.  And if you own an index fund that is based on the Dow, you are not just following it, you are invested in it.  One of the biggest issues when bear markets eventually strike is that investors realize they had a chance to better-understand what they owned, but did not care about it until it was too late. There are many ways to structure a portfolio.  Many index ETFs are “capitalization-weighted” which means that the larger the value of a stock’s outstanding shares, the larger the weighting in that ETF and its underlying index.  That does not make a lot of sense to me in most cases, but it does to a lot of people, so that’s as far as I will go on that point for now.  The other way to allocate among stocks in an index or portfolio is to “equal-weight” the holdings.  This makes more sense to me, but then again, I also love all my kids equally, so there you go.  I do notice that more ETFs are equal-weighting their holdings, but cap-weighting is still the dominant approach. Now, back to the Dow.   The venerable stock market indicator weights its 30 holdings based on the dollar price of the stock.  Why?  Because in 1896, Charles Dow decided it was the simplest way to help investors understand the stock market (source: Investopedia).  I wish there were some more erudite process I could explain to you, but there is not.  Yet for 121 years, this has been the case with the Dow.  I created a table below to help you see the folly of this approach today, and so that you can join me in shaking your head as to why this has not been changed all these years. What is the Dow? It depends on how you slice it. Ycharts.com as of 10/20/17 market close From left to right, see the price-weighted composition of the Dow, which is the actual Dow Jones Industrial Average you see quoted.  Note that only 7 stocks make up over 42% of the Dow index.  The other 23 stocks comprise only 58% of the Dow.  This top-heaviness is due in part to strong price moves by the companies that now top the list, since the more their prices climb relative to the prices of the other stocks, the higher their weighting goes.  But if you thought you were making a big investment in the stocks at the lower portion of the list, you are not. Next, I constructed a capitalization-weighted Dow, and you can see that those top 7 Dow components make up only about 16% of the total value of the 30 stocks in the index.  In other words, if the Dow were set up like the S&P 500 and many other indexes, it would look completely different. Finally, I show an equal-weight version of the Dow. At the bottom of the chart, you can see the return for 2017 of each version of the Dow, through October 20.  For this year so far, the returns are very high in all cases.  But that is not the point.  The point is that the Dow is not influenced by “the stock market” as much as it is the current beneficiaries of the Dow’s quirky stock weighting scheme.  This is that thing I mentioned before, that investors may regret not realizing when times are not as good as they are now for the Dow. The 30 Largest S&P 500 Component Stocks, Based on Price Per Share YCharts 2017 Finally, since the Dow and S&P 500 are often used interchangeably in conversation about how the “market” is doing, I put together another chart showing what the S&P 500’s 30 largest holdings would look like if it used a price-weighted approach instead of a market-cap weighted approach (note that I included 31 total securities Alphabet a.k.a. Google is listed twice given its 2 separate share classes).  As you can see, this looks very little like the Dow.  More significantly, it looks nothing like the S&P 500!  The top 30 stocks make up only 13.5% of this concocted price-weighted index.  And some of the stocks with the highest prices are among the smaller companies within the S&P 500. Keep your eyes out for what is NOT obvious about the current market rally.  It will serve you well when the unraveling eventually occurs.

That may not directly lead to GE being booted from the Dow, a move that would end a 110-year long membership. It would mark the third time that GE was not a member of the blue-chip barometer--it was removed and then brought back twice before its latest stretch.

On Thursday, GE shares fell 0.3% to $21.43 in midday trade, while Boeing’s stock slipped 0.2% to $257.87. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., told MarketWatch earlier this year that the committee members “prefer” that the ratio of the highest to lowest priced stocks in the Dow be “less than” 10 to 1. GE’s stock broke that ratio guideline on Sept. 8, when it fell to a close of $23.82, while Boeing shares rose to $238.78. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices said they won’t comment on individual stocks, but added that none of the “rules” are set in stone. The index committee regularly meets to review the composition of its indexes, as well as pending corporate actions, statistics comparing its indexes to the broader market and significant market events, which could include excessive share price movements. “In addition, the committees may revise index policy covering rules for selecting companies, treatment of dividends, share counts or other matters,” the company said in a statement. “S&P Dow Jones Indices considers information about changes to its indices and related matter to be potentially market moving and material.

GE was a founding member of the Dow, which launched on May 26, 1896 with 12 members, including long-gone “smokestack” companies such as American Cotton Oil, Tennessee Coal & Iron and U.S. Leather, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It was replaced in September 1898, when founding member U.S. Rubber re-entered the index, but then returned just seven months later. GE exited again in April 1901, then came back in on Nov. 7, 1907, as it replaced fellow founding member Tennessee Coal & Iron. It has remained in the index ever since. GE has had a nice run that past century, but a change may be needed. It ended the year as the biggest S&P 500 index component by market capitalization as recently as 2005, when it was valued at $370.3 million, according to data provided by S&P Global. With a current market cap of $189.1 billion, it has less than a quarter of Apple’s market cap of $811.1 billion, and ranks 16th in the Dow by that metric.

",GE’s stock has breached an unwritten rule for Dow members - MarketWatch,0.8807
257,Philip van Doorn,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 3:46 p.m. ET A measure called return on corporate capital is revealing — and there’s a free investor tool for research By Ever since stocks were first bought and sold, investors have sought to find company metrics that would separate the winners from the losers. Sales growth, earnings growth, earnings per share — even CEO pay. Now it turns out that companies that are good at deploying capital to produce quality goods and services represent lower risk and a higher likelihood of long-term stock gains. We examined this phenomenon two years ago, tying high returns on invested capital (ROIC) to excellent stock performance over very long periods. The data were provided by FactSet, which defines ROIC as a company’s net income divided by total invested capital (total shareholders’ equity and long-term debt). The idea of ROIC is to measure how efficiently a company’s managers use the money they have raised. At that time, Gary Lutin, a former investment banker at Lutin & Co. who oversees the Shareholder Forum in New York, said long-term investors who wanted to invest some of their money in individual stocks also needed to think about the products and services being sold by the companies and consider whether they would remain competitive for up to 20 years. Lutin & Co. invests only in non-publicly-traded companies, so as not to interfere with Lutin’s work at the Shareholder Forum, which works to provide “fair access to information that can be relied upon by both corporate and investor decision-makers,” and receives financial support from professional investors. Free data The Shareholder Forum on Oct. 20 rolled out a new calculation called return on corporate capital (ROCC). That can be useful for investors because the data are available for free and are calculated in a uniform manner using GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) data from SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) filings. Definitions of ROIC vary, and some companies even calculate ROIC using adjusted earnings numbers. But ROCC is calculated the same way for every company, using annual data: Net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. The idea is that if a company consistently generates high returns on corporate capital, good things will eventually happen. A focus on the company’s main business, rather than financial engineering through share buybacks or on adjusted earnings figures, means real profits are rolling in at high levels relative to investment. That eventually can be expected to support higher share prices, as the profits feed organic expansion, acquisitions or other things that are good for shareholders. The example of Valeant Evan Tindell, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bireme Capital, said ROCC enables investors to “look at the absolutely unadjusted figures.” He cited Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

                                   as a company that “consistently” focuses on adjusted figures in its earnings releases. For example, Valeant reported a GAAP net loss of $38 million for the second quarter, but adjusted earnings of $362 million, after making adjustments for amortization, asset impairments restructuring and other times. Wall Street analysts’ estimates are based on projected adjusted earnings per share. Valeant’s average ROCC over the past five fiscal years has been 1.8%, compared with 8.7% for its industry group, according the “real” GAAP numbers used by the Shareholder Forum. In an interview on Oct. 17, Lutin pointed out that ROCC comparisons are a sound foundation for analysis but should be considered only the starting point. Some companies, such as Amazon.com Inc.

                                   will be “spending what could be booked as profits today in their development of goods and services to make bigger profits tomorrow,” he said Amazon’s average ROCC over the past five years is 4.9%. That looks like a low figure, but for investors, the Amazon story has been about rapid sales growth, dominance in internet retail and expansion into new areas of business. The low ROCC and the stock’s high price-to-earnings ratio — 125.7 times consensus 2018 earnings estimates — may mean this type of valuation will eventually become unsustainable.

                                   for example, you can see the company’s average ROCC is 26.2%. The ROCC tool uses Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) from companies’ SEC filings to determine industry groups. These company-specified classifications are not always the best reflection of their current business, so you may have to make your own comparisons of companies in similar industries. For example, with 3M, you can see its ROCC greatly exceeds that of its industry group. The problem is that the industry group is “surgical and medical instruments,” when this industry represents only one of 3M’s five industry groups. If we look at the S&P 500’s industrial sector, there are seven companies that FactSet classifies as industrial conglomerates. Here are the five-year average ROCC figures for the group, along with their five-year total returns: You can see that for this industry group, the one with the best ROCC over the past five years didn’t have the best total return.

John Maynard Keynes famously described the stock market as a beauty contest in his 1936 book, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” to explain price fluctuations in equity markets. What he meant was that investors were trying to determine which stocks would be most attractive to other investors. “Speculating on what other people will find beautiful is a fool’s game,” Lutin said. “It’s a lot easier, and a whole lot safer, to pick a company that generates good returns by producing goods and services. A sound business foundation is also likely to continue its value a lot longer than today’s beauty.” Here are five-year average returns on corporate capital for the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average

258,,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"The U.S. Justice Department approved the tie-up this month with some conditions, including some divestitures. The FCC extended the same conditions in its approval order, the first major telecom merger approved under President Donald Trump. In addition to approving the CenturyLink deal, the FCC outlined a new standard by which the agency will review future mergers — a shift that could make it easier for other large media and telecommunications mergers to win approval. “It has reached a point where all our media policy decisions seem to be custom built for this one company,” FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said of the Sinclair deal at a congressional hearing last week. The FCC has traditionally employed a balancing test weighing potential public interest harms against any potential public interest benefits and applicants bear the burden of proof. The FCC approval of CenturyLink’s Level 3 deal offered a more limited standard of review that would use “narrowly tailored transaction-specific conditions to remedy” harms, according to the order. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, dissented and said the Republican majority “radically alters the commission’s long-standing merger review standards,” her office said. Rosenworcel said “instead of using the agency’s decades-old merger review standard, (the FCC) arbitrarily introduces a new one.” Commission Republicans have pushed to halt the practice of demanding conditions or concessions from companies seeking to merge that are not directly related to a transaction. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who has been critical of the FCC review process under former President Barack Obama, denied the FCC was changing the standard of review in issuing the decision. “But we do make clear what had become increasingly hazy in recent years. This clarity will help the public to see that transactional review is an occasion to carefully consider how the transaction itself impacts the public interest, not an opportunity to extract a range of concessions, tangentially-related at best,” Pai said Monday.

Equifax last week delayed scheduling its quarterly earnings announcement in the wake of the incident that has sparked several investigations. Verizon combined Yahoo with AOL, which it bought two years ago, to form a venture called Oath. Mayer, a former Google executive, said in June in a blog post that Yahoo had taken steps to bolster its “security defenses.” Verizon in February lowered its original offer for Yahoo assets by $350 million in the wake of two massive cyber attacks at the internet company. The closing of the deal, which was announced in July 2016, was delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from data breaches Yahoo disclosed last year.

260,,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote next month to allow broadcasters to voluntarily use a new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, the agency said on Thursday. The FCC in February granted initial approval for the advanced standard that would also let broadcasters use a TV set that is turned off to send emergency alerts, but would require TV owners to eventually buy new sets or converter boxes. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said on Thursday Net Generation TV would be “the first standard to marry the advantages of broadcasting and the Internet. It holds the promise of delivering better video and audio, advanced emergency alerts, improved accessibility features, personalized and interactive content.” The proposal would require local simulcasting of current signals for at least five years for stations that choose to deploy Next Gen TV so existing TVs and tuners can still receive programming, a person briefed on the matter said. The ATSC 3.0 standard offers much more precise geolocating of TV signals, ultra-high definition picture quality and more interactive programming. It was created by a nonprofit group represented by the broadcasting, consumer electronics, cable, computer and motion picture industries. The standard uses precision broadcasting and targets emergency or weather alerts on a street-by-street basis. The system could allow broadcasters to wake up a receiver to broadcast emergency alerts. The alerts could include maps, storm tracks and evacuation routes, companies have said. At a House hearing on Wednesday, Democratic U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell raised privacy concerns about the data the new TVs could collect about viewers. One issue is whether broadcasters will be able to pass on the costs of advanced broadcast signals through higher retransmissions fees and demand that providers carry the signals. The National Association of Broadcasters, which represents Tegna Inc, Comcast Corp, CBS Corp, Scripps Networks Interactive Inc, Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and others, petitioned the FCC in April 2016 to approve the new standard. Many companies have raised concerns about costs, including AT&T Inc. Verizon Communications Inc said last week the FCC should not require TV viewers “to pay for a new broadcast TV service they have not yet requested.” Cable, satellite and other pay TV providers “would incur significant costs to receive, transmit, and deliver ATSC 3.0 signals to subscribers, including for network and subscriber equipment,” Verizon said. Verizon also said because of the increased bandwidth requirements, TV providers would be forced “to reconfigure channel lineups and potentially drop some programming.” LG Electronics Inc said in a filing that the next generation standard is “the future of mass media communications – a future that is increasingly mobile, interactive and content-rich.” Many nations are considering the new standard. South Korea adopted the ATSC 3.0 standard in 2016. ","

261,,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"(This Oct 26 story in the 11th paragraph, corrects to say Viacom announced plans to launch its streaming Nickelodeon channel in Japan earlier this month, from launched it) By Jessica Toonkel New York-based Viacom already has mobile agreements in other countries. Now, it is in talks with U.S. carriers to see if it can execute a similar strategy, Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish told Reuters in an exclusive interview recently. The company is setting up a division that ultimately will have at least 100 people to produce short-form shows that are more easily watched on mobile phones, he said. “There are hundreds of millions of mobile users in the U.S. who are in the nascent stages of consuming content on their devices and certainly are in the nascent stages of doing it on a pay basis,” Bakish said. Bakish declined to say which carriers his company has approached. The stakes are high for Viacom and its traditional TV rivals, which need to find new sources of revenue as they grapple with shrinking cable subscribers and fees from distribution deals. That makes dealing with mobile carriers, which it has done elsewhere, more attractive. In Japan, Viacom has two deals with mobile companies for its MTV and Nickelodeon apps. In the 18 months since launching, mobile consumption of Viacom’s MTV Hits, a music video service available on AbemaTV, a free, ad-supported web-based mobile service, has surpassed its MTV Japan TV channel, Viacom said. The two share ad revenue. In Indonesia, the No. 1 mobile carrier Telkomsel has started offering Nickelodeon children’s programming as part its data plans for its 173 million subscribers. Terms of the deals were not disclosed, but Viacom said 20 percent of its Japanese distribution revenues in 2017 were from  streaming clients, up from about 2 percent in 2014. While U.S mobile carriers are interested in video, it is important for content to be packaged to entice mobile viewers to keep watching, said Brian Angiolet, global chief media and content officer at Verizon. “The content community sees this opportunity but they can’t just raid what they are already doing,” Angiolet said. “It can’t look like what they have done with traditional partners.” ","

262,,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"Shares of Comcast were down 0.2 percent at $36.75 at mid-afternoon after tumbling nearly 4 percent in premarket trading as investors shrugged off higher-than-expected earnings. The company said it lost 125,000 video subscribers in the third quarter. It said in September that it might lose up to 150,000 due to recent hurricanes and increased competition in the pay-TV industry. Comcast has said it is well-positioned for changes in viewing habits because of its high-speed internet, or broadband, business, which added 214,000 subscribers in the quarter. But on a conference call, Wall Street analysts said that business’ growth had slowed. The company had added 330,000 broadband subscribers in the year-earlier period. The analysts asked how Comcast viewed the competitive landscape as rival AT&T expands its fiber-based internet service into areas Comcast serves. Chief Executive Brian Roberts said the company had anticipated AT&T’s expansion. “Our view is to deliver the best product, period, and we will constantly increase speeds,” he said. “That’s why we’ve been so focused on Wi-Fi.” In May, Comcast introduced its cloud-based XFi service, which allows users to set up their home Wi-Fi, shut off children’s devices at bedtime and troubleshoot problems from an application on their mobile phones, website or television. Roberts also said Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile service, which competes with wireless carriers like AT&T and Verizon, had surpassed 250,000 customer lines since its introduction in May. Net income attributable to Comcast rose 18.5 percent to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share. Excluding special items, earnings per share came to 52 cents. Analysts on average had expected 50 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

263,,11022017,Reuters,10262017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc and private equity firm JMC Capital Partners are looking to sell their stakes in a joint venture that operates more than 1,300 free WiFi kiosks fashioned from old phone booths around New York City, according to people familiar with the matter. The move is the latest twist in the project overseen by Daniel Doctoroff, former chief executive of news and data provider Bloomberg LP and former deputy mayor of New York City. He now runs Sidewalk Labs, an urban development unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. Doctoroff is chairman of a Sidewalk Labs subsidiary that is the top investor in the joint venture. Qualcomm and JMC are working with an investment bank to explore the sale of their stakes in CityBridge, the venture that is behind the LinkNYC WiFi project, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Qualcomm is seeking to exit the venture because it views it as non-core, while the private equity firm JMC is aiming to generate a profitable return on its investment, the people said. Qualcomm and Sidewalk Labs declined to comment. JMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jovana Rizzo, a spokesperson for CityBridge, said in a statement that the group is “committed to fulfilling its obligation to the city of New York and continuing the expansion of LinkNYC across the five boroughs.” A spokeswoman for New York City’s Information Technology & Telecommunications Department said in a statement that the city would have to approve any changes and so far “nothing has been presented to us. Any decision we make has to center around continuing the success of the program and ensuring New Yorkers’ best interests are met.” LinkNYC emerged in 2014 as part of a 12-year contract with New York City to replace 7,500 payphone stands and was expected to generate $500 million in revenue for the city’s coffers. The program’s launch in February 2016 prompted complaints from business owners and residents about crowds hanging around the hotspots for hours at a time and users browsing online pornography on kiosk screens. LinkNYC removed the web-browsing feature. More than 2.7 million people have registered to use the kiosks, which also have phone charging stations and free calling services, LinkNYC said Wednesday. LinkNYC kiosks generate revenue through ad sales. Qualcomm and JMC each invested about $25 million into the joint venture in 2014, the sources said. Another $50 million came from an outdoor advertising company and a software firm that were later bought by a consortium led by Sidewalk Labs and merged in 2015 under the name Intersection. Sidewalk Labs remains the lead investor. Sidewalk Labs, which already owns more half of the CityBridge joint venture through Intersection, could be a potential acquirer of the stakes, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Sidewalk Labs declined to comment on its potential interest. Large wireless carriers such as Verizon Communications and AT&T could potentially be good partners as well in the joint venture, according to the sources. Verizon and AT&T could not immediately be reached for comment. Sidewalk Labs’ Intersection expanded its network of Internet kiosks to London in June, turning on the first of 1,000 expected to be installed with Britain broadband provider BT and a local advertising firm. On Wednesday, Intersection announced plans to open 100 kiosks in Philadelphia without any business partners starting next year. ","

Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the largest consumer wireless service provider in the United States. It also owns a wireline business, providing phone, internet, and video service to the home, as well as a digital media business called Oath, combining the assets of Yahoo! and AOL. The vast majority of its revenue and earnings come from its wireless business, where it faces intense competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T). As T-Mobile and Sprint make moves to win over customers, they have chipped away at the industry economics that have benefited Verizon and AT&T. That's leaving some investors wondering whether Verizon stock is a buy. Image source: Verizon. As the largest wireless service provider, Verizon benefits greatly from economies of scale. While Verizon charges some of the highest prices for its service in the industry, its cost of providing that service per subscriber is actually one of the lowest. As a result it consistently reports the largest wireless EBITDA margin in the industry. Verizon's scale also protects it against future entrants into the industry. Building out a wireless network requires substantial upfront costs. There are also barriers to obtaining the wireless spectrum necessary to operate a wireless service. Considering these barriers, the threat of a new competitor entering the space in earnest is low. Companies like Comcast and Charter are actually using Verizon's network to launch their own wireless services instead of trying to enter the market on their own. Verizon also has a strong brand and network. That gives it some pricing power, but improvements in T-Mobile's network combined with its aggressive pricing have cut into Verizon's ability to charge a premium. Verizon is still, in my opinion, the best-positioned wireless carrier in a hyper-competitive market. Verizon's third-quarter earnings report gave a few reasons to be optimistic about the company's future. First of all, Verizon added over 250,000 net postpaid phone subscribers for the second quarter in a row. That reverses a trend of poor or negative net adds over the last couple years. That also shows the strength of Verizon's brand and network in both retaining existing subscribers and attracting new ones. More importantly, Verizon has started to turn around its falling wireless service revenue. The amount Verizon brought in from service contracts last quarter increased for the first time in three years, and management said the trend will continue in the fourth quarter. That said, service revenue is still falling year over year, but should start to show improvements as soon as next year. Verizon is a strong company and its operations are moving in the right direction, but whether or not the stock is a buy ultimately comes down to what investors have to pay for it. Here's how the four major wireless companies stack up in terms of valuation. Company Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.8 T-Mobile 7.4 Sprint 5.6 With an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.9, Verizon appears to be fairly valued. It's trading for the same multiple as AT&T, its closest competitor. Considering AT&T's massive investment in the pay-TV industry and its declining postpaid phone subscriber base, I think Verizon's growth prospects are actually better than AT&T's and should earn it a higher multiple. Meanwhile, T-Mobile trades for a slightly higher EV-to-EBITDA ratio. It probably deserves a higher multiple than Verizon due to its rapid growth. The opposite is true for Sprint, and it's reflected in its depressed price. As such, Verizon appears fairly valued on an EV-to-EBITDA ratio. For investors looking to get into the wireless industry, it presents a good buy right now. I'll be holding onto my own shares for the foreseeable future. ","

267,"Rich Duprey, Travis Hoium, and Brian Feroldi",11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Among the pearls of wisdom Warren Buffett has dropped along the way in his long investing career, the saying ""price is what you pay, value is what you get"" is one of his more famous ones. And when looking for a deep-value stock, that phrase is highly appropriate. Don't concentrate solely on the prices Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), or The Chefs' Warehouse (NASDAQ:CHEF) are trading at to determine whether they're a good value; dive deeper to see why, despite their prices, they are bargain-basement stocks. Brian Feroldi (Tractor Supply): If you're a city dweller, then the odds are good that you've never set foot in a Tractor Supply store before. That's because this retailer primarily caters to country folk who live in rural areas and have a unique set of product needs -- think animal feed, fences, tools, and outdoor gear. Tractor Supply has been highly successful at fulfilling its customers' needs for years. That's taking long-term investors on a highly profitable ride: TSCO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts What's amazing about these numbers is that Tractor Supply has generated them without much help from online sales at all. In fact, the company only recently rolled out its ""buy online, pick up in-store"" program, which is something that other retailers have offered for years. This suggests that Tractor Supply's success is largely owed to its first-mover advantage in many rural areas. Despite its history of success, Tractor Supply's stock has been whacked recently on the back of tepid earnings and the general retailer malaise. However, I'm still bullish on this company because same-store sales are growing and there is still plenty of room left in the U.S. for store growth -- especially when you factor in the company's PetSense concept. Wall Street shares my bullishness and is projecting earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in excess of 11% annually over the next five years. That's quite compelling for a company that is only trading at 16 times forward earnings and offers up a dividend yield of 1.8%. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Paying a cellphone bill has become one of the most common expenses for Americans in 2017, and Verizon is one of the biggest beneficiaries of that spending. The company has one of the top two cellular networks, along with AT&T, and is able to generate long-term consistent cash flow from customers under contract. You can see in the chart below that Verizon's growth and free cash flow have taken a step backward in the last year, but that's for good reason. Aging 4G networks are coming under immense competition from T-Mobile and Sprint, causing price pressure for Verizon. At the same time, the company is investing in its next-generation 5G network. VZ Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts It's the 5G wireless network that makes me bullish on Verizon's growth and long-term cash flow. The company has a much bigger balance sheet than rivals like Sprint and T-Mobile, allowing it to launch a nationwide network more quickly. As the network rolls out, we'll see millions of new devices from self-driving cars, wireless watches, VR devices, and more connected to Verizon's network. Verizon's stock is a great value at 12.6 times trailing earnings, and a 4.8% dividend yield should please income investors. Long-term, this is a company that should grow from its already massive base because I see no sign that the future isn't becoming even more wireless than it is today. Image source: Getty Images. Rich Duprey (The Chefs' Warehouse): Despite the malaise in the restaurant industry, one of the best-performing sectors has been fine dining, which -- until August anyway -- had experienced growth every month so far this year. Now, for two consecutive months, same-store sales have been down. In September, the segment was the worst performer, due largely to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hitting Texas and Florida hard. Even so, The Chefs' Warehouse still finds itself up 26% year to date and over 70% higher for the past 12 months. The specialty food products distributor makes sure fine dining establishments, country clubs, cruise lines, and other specialty food places have unique center-of-plate dishes to offer customers to set themselves apart from the competition. Although expenses have grown, organic growth is still charging ahead, up 10% in the second quarter, which it seeks to expand upon by bringing chain restaurants into the fold. It is also in the direct-to-consumer market now, too. The restaurant business may be in a decline, but it is beginning to rebound, and analysts see 2018 getting better for the industry. So how do we get to The Chefs' Warehouse being a deep-value stock? Despite trading at 42 times trailing earnings and 34 times next year's estimates, the market values it at just 12 times the free cash flow it produces. The specialty food distributor is expected to grow earnings at 15% annually for the next five years, with profits anticipated to be 42% higher next year. This small-cap stock is valued at only $523 million at the moment, but it has the potential to become a billion-dollar leader as restaurants seek to gain an edge over the competition by putting The Chefs' Warehouse's unique dishes on their menus.

    3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.999
268,Motley Fool Staff,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For Amazon, revenue last quarter was up 34%, retail sales were up 22% year over year, AWS revenue was up 42%, and its high-margin segments are growing by leaps and bounds. How much longer can the e-commerce leader keep up this pace? And how big are its opportunities in areas like the online pharmacy business? Meanwhile, Alphabet is growing across the board, and at an accelerating rate; and thanks to Google's skinny TV bundles and YouTube streaming, people are spending a lot more time watching its video content -- but yes, there was a minor smudge in this shiny report, related to its mobile penetration. And as for Microsoft, it's continuing to use the cloud to power its renaissance. But if you think that means that its PC-related business has to be declining, think again. (These Fools give a lot of credit to the man at the top, CEO Satya Nadella.) So here's the real question: All of these stocks have just set new highs. Which, if any, are still solid buys at these levels? A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: We begin this week with Earningspalooza. Three of the biggest public companies all hitting record highs. Microsoft, Alphabet, we're going to start with Amazon's third-quarter report. Revenue came in just shy of $44 billion, that's a 34% increase over a year ago. Shares of Amazon on Friday, Jeff, up 12%. Jeff Fischer: Unbelievable, Chris. The shares are up 46% year to date, and 360% just in the last five years. If you thought you were too late to Amazon, you were not. The good news is, I don't think you're too late now, either. I think the company will be much more valuable five and 10 years from now. Right now, it has a $525 billion market cap. Let's see where it is five years from now, I bet it'll be much higher. Anyway, Chris, retail sale sales were up 22% year over year. That's higher than they grew a year ago, when they grew 20%. That's amazing. Amazon Web Services revenue was up 42%, which is a little slower than a year ago, but still very strong. The company did have lower operating margins pretty much across the board. The Web Services business, which is key, which is where a lot of profits are made, the operating margins were up at sequentially, so people were happy to see that, as well. Not talked about so much, but really interesting to me is, ad revenue was up about 60%. Huge growth there, and that's very high marching revenue, and they have a lot more room to keep growing that revenue. Hill: Yeah. Amazon, a company that famously keeps things close to the vest, they don't have an advertising division, per say, Matty. The number he referenced there goes in their ""other revenue"" segment. Matt Argersinger: It speaks to the tremendous optionality of this business. I'll go back to the core retail business growing over 20%. If you look at the overall e-commerce just in the U.S., it's growing in the low teens year over year. So, as mature as Amazon is, it's still putting up this amazing growth. We've talked a lot about other companies making headway. Wal-Mart is making headway, Target, to a certain extent, other e-commerce players. But Amazon, the Juggernaut of the business, is still growing and accelerating its growth, which I just think is exceptional. Fischer: Yeah, Matt, and they haven't yet cracked groceries to a great extent. They bought Whole Foods, but it's still a small part of their business. They haven't really cracked healthcare, let alone pharmacy, there are rumors that they're looking at how to get into that, because that's a giant industry. So, there's a lot more for them to grab. Hill: As we came into the studio to tape today, there were all these reports that CVS is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for as much as $66 billion, and part of the rationale for that, if it in fact goes through, is so that CVS can defend against Amazon. Argersinger: It's amazing. Actually, Jason was telling me before the show that you can type AmazonRx, and right now it goes just Amazon. But clearly, whatever anecdotal evidence you need, Amazon is getting into this business. I think about the fact that, now, my wife and I, for the most part, we get all of our groceries at home. Amazonfresh is an amazing service. With the Whole Foods acquisition, you have more and more to choose from. But I like the idea of, you go see your doctor, order directly from your doctor online through Amazon, and by the time you get home, your drugs are waiting for you, along with your groceries. Hill: Do you think there's someone whose job it is at Amazon to just secure URLs? That Jeff Bezos is like, ""I don't know if we're going to do this, go ahead and secure that just in case."" Alphabet's third quarter profits came in higher than expected, so did overall revenue. Their margins are growing. Matty, did anything bad happen to Alphabet? Or was this all sunshine and rainbows? Because it really looks like all sunshine and rainbows. Argersinger: It really is. There might be one thing I'll mention. This is another example of the big getting bigger, the big getting stronger. We talked about Amazon's business accelerating. Alphabet's business is kind of accelerating. Revenue up 24%. That's above the average they've been generating the last several years. Growth in the core advertising business was up 21%, and growth in Google's other revenue -- this is not other bets, just other revenue, hardware, cloud -- that business was up 40%. What really impresses me, and it's impressed me for a long time but continues to blow my mind is YouTube, and the power of what that's doing for the platform and for Google's search business. 1.5 billion users spending an average of 60 minutes per day on YouTube. It's massive. But one interesting thing the company pointed out in the conference call is, they're also racking up a lot of time in the living room. 100 million viewing hours per day at home through smart TV or other TV devices. No longer is YouTube just, I'm looking at my phone or my iPad or playing a game or something like that. It's now, people are watching YouTube on their TV and doing so at really prodigious rates. Jason Moser: Yeah, the skinny bundle offering, just like Hulu has, I think there's a lot of runway there. And we're seeing them making a big advertising push. Certainly, we've seen some stuff here going on in the baseball playoffs season. I think that, as time goes on, those skinny bundles that Hulu and Google are offering are only going to get better, because they give consumers what they want in the way of content, and the service aspect of it is just so much more optimal. When you consider that you don't have to call anybody, you just go in there and click the button here or there, you record a payment, you don't have to call or wait on hold -- Argersinger: It's so easy. Moser: The service aspect of it is so much better than something you might deal with with Verizon or Comcast, who notoriously have very bad reputations for service. Argersinger: One small cloud over this sunshine and rainbows we've been talking about is the traffic acquisition cost. They're up 54% year over year. That's of course, Google paying smartphone makers and web browsers to run Google search and ads. Critical cost, that's again up 54%. Mainly that's because mobile is so much more of an expensive platform for them, they have to really pay up for it. We want to see that scale out, we want to see that number come down, otherwise Alphabet's operating profits probably are going to keep up with revenue over time. Hill: Microsoft's first-quarter profits came in solidly higher than Wall Street was expecting. Jason, the cloud business continues to grow, has been growing for a while. The PC business growing this quarter, too. That was a little bit surprising. Moser: A little bit. The word I used back in July was cloud. The word this quarter is cloud. This is the same old thing here, but that's in a good way. When you look at the commercial cloud business, the run rate is now at $20 billion annually. For context, Amazon Web Service is around $18 billion, both leaving Google in the dust in that regard right now. But, Google is obviously a very good player as well. The more I think about it, the more I think Satya Nadella is Microsoft's Steve Easterbrook. We think about all of the success that Easterbrook has had at McDonald's in turning this business around. Satya Nadella has done a lot of the same with Microsoft, identifying the key opportunities, cloud. I think we probably all still have some questions about the LinkedIn acquisition, but the bottom line is, they're realizing stronger engagement and it's contributing to earnings per share. Then, there's a big runway in gaming, as well. A new Xbox coming soon. All in all, this is still a business that's extremely relevant in offices all over the world. Again, I think that's going to continue, and Nadella and his team are doing a very good job exploiting that and monetizing it, and investors are clearly winning. Hill: We've got Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft. We have three stocks. These are three of the four biggest public companies out there. Apple is the biggest. We'll be talking about them on next week's show when they report their earnings. But of these three stocks, for investors who are looking over the next five to 10 years, they're all hitting new highs this week. Are any of them unreasonably priced? Is one more so than the others, you look at and think, ""Even if you have the five to 10 year time horizon, it's something where you want to wait for a little bit of a pullback?"" What do you think, Matty? Argersinger: I'll call it Microsoft only because I think the business, compared to the other two, is a lot more mature, and the valuation for Microsoft is kind of in line with Alphabet. And I think Alphabet has a lot bigger runway ahead of it. What Microsoft has done has been very impressive. But if I had to pick one of the three, I would say Microsoft. Hill: Jason? Moser: I think Amazon is the easy target there, but Matty hits on a very good point. We have to think forward. Microsoft, I think we've been conditioned to accept this low valuation. It's still somewhere around 20X free cash flow. But, on a forward-looking basis, I think Alphabet and Amazon are the companies that have the bigger opportunities. Honestly, I think you buy a little bit of all three and you'd be just fine. Hill: Jeff? Fischer: I'll say, there's no question that all three trade at a bull market type of price, and at some point in the next five to 10 years, we'll see a significant market drawback. It's almost inevitable. Call it a bear market, whatever you like. We'll see a year or two of stocks falling, at least, in the next five to 10 years. That said, I think all three are priced such that five years, there's a decent chance they'll generate a decent return over five years. 10 years, there's a very good chance they'll generate a good return. That is, as long as Amazon or Google, Alphabet, is not attacked by regulations, or Amazon, which trades at 75X free cash flow, compared to Microsoft at 20X, doesn't make some missteps and hit its profitability prospects.

269,Barbara Kollmeyer,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 27, 2017 10:24 a.m. ET Eager buyers get up early to place an order, only to be thwarted by tech glitches By For some of Apple’s faithful clients, the joy was being sucked out of a big day — that is, the first opportunity to order the $999 iPhone X. Less than 10 minutes after pre-orders opened online on Friday, people were being told that their iPhone X wouldn’t arrive for two to three weeks (or more) — a sign that initial supplies had already run out. Now that wait has now stretched out to as long as six weeks for both the 64GB and the 256 versions, according to the Apple web site. Preorders for the iPhone X were scheduled to begin at 3:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the company’s website and via the Apple Store app in more than 55 countries and territories, for delivery of the handset at the end of next week. But earlier Friday, the hashtag #iPhone X was top-trending on Twitter, as complaints piled up from fans trying to be first to get the new smartphone. Some of the frustration was aimed at Apple

Likely to move to after Christmas very soon this morning. #iPhoneX The rush to pre-order and high demand may be a sign that Apple has managed once again to rally the iPhone faithful and their bank accounts to its retail cause. Read: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Intel find billions more in profit But may also be a reflection of fears that the handset may be in short supply. Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported earlier this week that iPhone X shipments may be only half what is expected this year. The last time Apple provided pre-order sales data was in 2014 for the iPhone 6. Pre-orders were 4 million that year. $AAPL pic.twitter.com/Tspi5lhqe6 Shares of Apple rose 1.9% early Friday, as the reports eased concerns over demand for the $999 iPhone X. A survey of availability by Cascend Securities in the 100 most populous markets in the U.S. found that in every case, iPhone X was sold out for pre-order online home delivery by 5 a.m., when it started the survey. Apple’s iPhone 8, which shipped out last month, posted the weakest sales of any of the company’s new phones in recent years, according to estimates by two market-research companies.

271,Austen Hufford,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 7:14 a.m. ET By Comcast Corp. suffered its largest quarterly loss of cable television subscribers in three years, underscoring the pressure on traditional TV players as competition with new entrants heats up. The cable giant's results for the September quarter come after AT&T Inc. said Tuesday that it was continuing to lose its most profitable pay-TV viewers. The traditional pay TV providers are competing with new, more affordable online channel bundles, as well as streaming services like Netflix Inc., which are luring away subscribers. Despite such concerns, Comcast on Thursday reported higher-than-expected profits per share as well as adjusted revenue growth. In the cable TV business, the company lost 125,000 residential and business customers, compared with a gain of 32,000 in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, Comcast lost 34,000 residential and business video customers. The company, like AT&T, believes the spate of major hurricanes in the quarter contributed to the subscriber losses. Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase. Comcast gained 214,000 internet customers in the quarter, down from the 330,000 gained in the year-ago period. Total revenue per customer relationship increased 2.1% to $151.51. Comcast lost 94,000 voice customers in the quarter, compared with an addition of 2,000 in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue for Comcast's cable division, which makes up 62% of the top line, rose 5.1% to $13.2 billion. This year Comcast launched a new wireless cellphone service, aimed at adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already. The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with Verizon Communications to offer its service. Comcast has signaled that it views the wireless service as an add-on for its customers, aimed at increasing profits and reducing the percentage of customers leaving its service. At the NBCUniversal media division, revenue and profits had tough comparisons to last year, when the company's networks aired the 2016 Olympic Games. Revenue in the division fell 13% to $8.01 billion, with declines in both the broadcast television and cable networks divisions. When the impact of the Games was stripped out, revenue increased 6%. Revenue in the filmed entertainment division fell 0.5% as there were no megahits in the quarter. Still, the company's release of ""Despicable Me 3"" highlighted its focus on growing the size of its franchise business, which provides revenue beyond a movie's theater run. Theme parks revenue increased 7.7%, driven by new attractions in Japan and Orlando, Fla. In all, net income rose to $2.65 billion, or 55 cents a share, up from $2.24 billion, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share came in at 52 cents. Revenue fell 1.6% to $20.98 billion but adjusted revenue, excluding the impact of the Olympics, grew 5.8%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share on $21.04 billion in revenue.

272,Austen Hufford,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Popular stock indicator presents risks to investors due to how its 30 stocks are weighted. Adobe Stock The “Dow” is hitting new highs with regularity.  That sounds good to casual market observers.  Heck, every week I hear about someone who does not know or care about the stock market telling their friends about how the Dow just crossed a certain level, and that its doing great in general.  That’s true in fact, but there is more to it, unless you just want to rest on your laurels and ignore a major risk that is inherent in tracking the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the favorite market proxy for decades before the S&P 500, once considered a gauge monitored by professional investors only, started to replace the Dow in notoriety.  As I have written and shown in past articles, the S&P 500 is a terrible proxy for the stock market as we get later into a bull market cycle, but as it turns out, the Dow is even worse.  A while back, I alerted you to the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is based on a very oddball formula to determine how much influence each of its 30 component stocks has on the overall index.  The allocation, or weighting of each of the stocks in the index is simply a function of the dollar price of each stock.  Why is that an issue?  Because the price of a stock is not a valuation measure.  If one stock is selling at $100 a share and another at $50 a share, that tells you nothing about where it has been, what its earnings trend is, or anything else that might be of value to an investor who actually cares to know what they own. This creates a false sense of what you are following when you follow the Dow.  And if you own an index fund that is based on the Dow, you are not just following it, you are invested in it.  One of the biggest issues when bear markets eventually strike is that investors realize they had a chance to better-understand what they owned, but did not care about it until it was too late. There are many ways to structure a portfolio.  Many index ETFs are “capitalization-weighted” which means that the larger the value of a stock’s outstanding shares, the larger the weighting in that ETF and its underlying index.  That does not make a lot of sense to me in most cases, but it does to a lot of people, so that’s as far as I will go on that point for now.  The other way to allocate among stocks in an index or portfolio is to “equal-weight” the holdings.  This makes more sense to me, but then again, I also love all my kids equally, so there you go.  I do notice that more ETFs are equal-weighting their holdings, but cap-weighting is still the dominant approach. Now, back to the Dow.   The venerable stock market indicator weights its 30 holdings based on the dollar price of the stock.  Why?  Because in 1896, Charles Dow decided it was the simplest way to help investors understand the stock market (source: Investopedia).  I wish there were some more erudite process I could explain to you, but there is not.  Yet for 121 years, this has been the case with the Dow.  I created a table below to help you see the folly of this approach today, and so that you can join me in shaking your head as to why this has not been changed all these years. What is the Dow? It depends on how you slice it. Ycharts.com as of 10/20/17 market close From left to right, see the price-weighted composition of the Dow, which is the actual Dow Jones Industrial Average you see quoted.  Note that only 7 stocks make up over 42% of the Dow index.  The other 23 stocks comprise only 58% of the Dow.  This top-heaviness is due in part to strong price moves by the companies that now top the list, since the more their prices climb relative to the prices of the other stocks, the higher their weighting goes.  But if you thought you were making a big investment in the stocks at the lower portion of the list, you are not. Next, I constructed a capitalization-weighted Dow, and you can see that those top 7 Dow components make up only about 16% of the total value of the 30 stocks in the index.  In other words, if the Dow were set up like the S&P 500 and many other indexes, it would look completely different. Finally, I show an equal-weight version of the Dow. At the bottom of the chart, you can see the return for 2017 of each version of the Dow, through October 20.  For this year so far, the returns are very high in all cases.  But that is not the point.  The point is that the Dow is not influenced by “the stock market” as much as it is the current beneficiaries of the Dow’s quirky stock weighting scheme.  This is that thing I mentioned before, that investors may regret not realizing when times are not as good as they are now for the Dow. The 30 Largest S&P 500 Component Stocks, Based on Price Per Share YCharts 2017 Finally, since the Dow and S&P 500 are often used interchangeably in conversation about how the “market” is doing, I put together another chart showing what the S&P 500’s 30 largest holdings would look like if it used a price-weighted approach instead of a market-cap weighted approach (note that I included 31 total securities Alphabet a.k.a. Google is listed twice given its 2 separate share classes).  As you can see, this looks very little like the Dow.  More significantly, it looks nothing like the S&P 500!  The top 30 stocks make up only 13.5% of this concocted price-weighted index.  And some of the stocks with the highest prices are among the smaller companies within the S&P 500. Keep your eyes out for what is NOT obvious about the current market rally.  It will serve you well when the unraveling eventually occurs.

273,Tomi Kilgore,11022017,MarketWatch,10262017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 12:13 p.m. ET Ending a 110-year streak as a Dow member could be a blessing in disguise for GE investors By Shares of General Electric Co. have fallen so far this year that they have broken an unwritten rule that the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average use for inclusion in the 121-year old index, in which GE is a founding member. That may not directly lead to GE being booted from the Dow, a move that would end a 110-year long membership. It would mark the third time that GE was not a member of the blue-chip barometer--it was removed and then brought back twice before its latest stretch. But getting kicked out of the Dow

On Thursday, GE shares fell 0.3% to $21.43 in midday trade, while Boeing’s stock slipped 0.2% to $257.87. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., told MarketWatch earlier this year that the committee members “prefer” that the ratio of the highest to lowest priced stocks in the Dow be “less than” 10 to 1. GE’s stock broke that ratio guideline on Sept. 8, when it fell to a close of $23.82, while Boeing shares rose to $238.78. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices said they won’t comment on individual stocks, but added that none of the “rules” are set in stone. The index committee regularly meets to review the composition of its indexes, as well as pending corporate actions, statistics comparing its indexes to the broader market and significant market events, which could include excessive share price movements. “In addition, the committees may revise index policy covering rules for selecting companies, treatment of dividends, share counts or other matters,” the company said in a statement. “S&P Dow Jones Indices considers information about changes to its indices and related matter to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all index committee discussions are confidential.” If the committee deemed GE no longer worthy of the Dow, for the first time since it was added back in on Nov. 7, 1907, investors may actually breathe a sigh of relief.

GE was a founding member of the Dow, which launched on May 26, 1896 with 12 members, including long-gone “smokestack” companies such as American Cotton Oil, Tennessee Coal & Iron and U.S. Leather, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It was replaced in September 1898, when founding member U.S. Rubber re-entered the index, but then returned just seven months later. GE exited again in April 1901, then came back in on Nov. 7, 1907, as it replaced fellow founding member Tennessee Coal & Iron. It has remained in the index ever since. GE has had a nice run that past century, but a change may be needed. It ended the year as the biggest S&P 500 index component by market capitalization as recently as 2005, when it was valued at $370.3 million, according to data provided by S&P Global. With a current market cap of $189.1 billion, it has less than a quarter of Apple’s market cap of $811.1 billion, and ranks 16th in the Dow by that metric.

274,,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer apologized on Wednesday for two massive data breaches at the internet company, blaming Russian agents for at least one of them, at a hearing on the growing number of cyber attacks on major U.S. companies. “Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users’ data.” Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December. In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes. Those charges came amid controversy relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Donald Trump. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election in any way. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said in March the 2013 breach was unrelated and that an investigation of the larger incident was continuing. Mayer later said under questioning that she did not know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach, but earlier spoke of state-sponsored attacks. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, asked Mayer on Wednesday why it took three years to identify the data breach or properly gauge its size. Mayer said Yahoo has not been able to identify how the 2013 intrusion occurred and that the company did not learn of the incident until the U.S. government presented data to Yahoo in November 2016. She said even “robust” defenses are not enough to defend against state-sponsored attacks and compared the fight with hackers to an “arms race.” Yahoo required users to change passwords and took new steps to make data more secure, Mayer said. “We now know that Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored hackers were responsible for highly complex and sophisticated attacks on Yahoo’s systems,” Mayer said. She said “really aggressive” pursuit of hackers was needed to discourage the efforts, and that even the most well-defended companies “could fall victim to these crimes.” The current and former chief executives of credit bureau Equifax, which disclosed in September that a data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, said they did not know who was responsible for the attack. Senator Bill Nelson said “only stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties will help incentivize companies to properly safeguard consumer information.” Thune told reporters after the hearing the Equifax data breach had created “additional momentum” for Congress to approve legislation. He said Mayer’s testimony was “important in shaping our future reactions.” The Senate Commerce Committee took the unusual step of subpoenaing Mayer to testify on Oct. 25 after a representative for Mayer declined multiple requests for her voluntarily testimony. A representative for Mayer said on Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily. ","

275, ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"Supported by Sprint and T-Mobile said on Saturday that they had ended merger talks, marking the second time in three years that the two failed to reach a deal to create a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T. The announcement represents a setback to Sprint, T-Mobile and their majority shareholders — Sprint is owned by the Japanese technology giant SoftBank and T-Mobile by Deutsche Telekom of Germany — in their efforts to create a stronger third-place competitor in the American wireless market. But unlike three years ago, when Sprint and T-Mobile called off their last round of merger discussions because of strong opposition from the Barack Obama administration, this time the culprit was control. The final blow to the latest round of talks came Saturday night in Tokyo, when Tim Höttges, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, met at the Tokyo home of SoftBank’s founder, Masayoshi Son, according to a person briefed on the matter. There, Mr. Höttges delivered to Mr. Son and Sprint’s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, new terms for a merger of the American companies. Mr. Son and Mr. Claure ultimately rejected the plan because it did not give SoftBank and Sprint enough control over the combined entity, people briefed on the discussions said. Choosing to abandon the deal talks means that Sprint and T-Mobile must now continue on their own paths to challenging their much bigger and better-financed rivals. For consumers, that probably signals a prolonging of a price war among the four wireless providers — one that analysts have said appears unsustainable for the smaller carriers in the long run. In a joint statement, Sprint and T-Mobile said that they could not come to “mutually agreeable terms” for a combination. “We have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, said in the statement. Mr. Claure of Sprint added in the statement, “We have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own.” People briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that a deal always hinged on SoftBank’s comfort with taking a minority stake in the combined business. Deutsche Telekom was expected to be the biggest shareholder of the merged company, given that T-Mobile is the bigger business by market value. T-Mobile’s market capitalization as of Friday’s close was $48.5 billion, while Sprint’s was $26.7 billion. Though the two had been in on-again, off-again talks for months, they appeared to be making progress, with an eye on striking a deal before Thanksgiving. But at a SoftBank board meeting on Friday, several directors of the Japanese company expressed reservations about giving up control of a major telecom service provider, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. Shares in both companies fell last week after Nikkei Asian Review, a Japanese business publication, reported that SoftBank intended to walk away from the transaction. But Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile planned to make one last offer to SoftBank and Sprint. The stakes for Sprint and T-Mobile are perhaps higher now than they were in the summer of 2014, when the two last pursued a merger. While both have waged a price war against their bigger competitors, drawing new customers in the process, few in the industry believe that the Sprint and T-Mobile can sustain the costs of a drawn-out war against better-capitalized opponents. Walking away from a merger with T-Mobile will provide the biggest test yet of Mr. Son’s ability to turn around Sprint after more than a decade of trouble. The billionaire led SoftBank’s takeover of the troubled American telecom in 2012, paying nearly $22 billion for a majority stake. At the time, Mr. Son argued that he could take on Verizon and AT&T — but those ambitions hinged on ultimately combining his new telecom with T-Mobile. Then, Sprint was seen as the stronger company and in position to own a bigger share of the combined business. Three years later, however, T-Mobile has become the better performer, its brash cost-cutting campaign forced Verizon and AT&T into a tough price war. Sprint has largely lagged behind, though analysts praised its third-quarter financial performance as showing signs of promise. Putting the two companies together would have created a business with more scale — and more financial capability to pay for both network upgrades and discounts for service plans. Sprint, in particular, was seen as bearing a bigger financial burden, carrying $34.2 billion in long-term debt on its books as of Sept. 30, while having posted annual losses for years. T-Mobile, while reporting $27.7 billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, has been profitable every year since 2013. Combining the two telecom providers would have helped their majority shareholders as well. SoftBank has faced concerns from investors about how it would manage Sprint’s debt load, while Deutsche Telekom has been concerned about the fate of its best-performing business asset. Among the most prominent advocates of a merger of the two companies was Mr. Son of SoftBank. “Three is a real fight, a real competition,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in September. Both companies had been hoping that, unlike in 2014, a merger of the two would be looked upon more favorably this time around. The Obama administration had strongly hinted that it would fight to oppose a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, arguing that consolidation would hurt consumers. By contrast, the deal makers at both companies said that they believed the Trump administration would let a deal take place. Now, Sprint and T-Mobile will be left on their own to battle Verizon and AT&T — and each other. Executives from both companies appeared ready to wage that fight. “We are determined to continue our efforts to change the wireless industry and compete fiercely,” Mr. Claure said in the joint statement. “We look forward to continuing to take the fight to the duopoly and newly emerging competitors.” And Mr. Legere wrote in a tweet, “We’ve been changing this industry for good for the past 5 years and #WeWontStop!” Advertisement ",Sprint and T-Mobile End Merger Discussions - The New York Times,-0.1707
276, ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp will accelerate investment in its network as it plots a future as a standalone company, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday, days after the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier and rival T-Mobile US Inc said merger talks had failed. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said at an investor conference the company could spend more than its previous guidance of $5 billion to $6 billion per year on capital expenditures, and that cash on hand could dip next year as it builds out its network. “We came to the realization that we’re still far away from what the Sprint network can actually deliver,” Claure said on Wednesday. “I don’t think we’ve put all our assets to work.” Sprint and No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile said on Saturday they have called off merger talks to create a combined U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Claure said on Wednesday that the talks fell through because SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son was not prepared to relinquish control of Sprint. SoftBank owns a majority of Sprint shares. “We’re always going to be open to looking at possible alternatives,” he said, adding that “we believe that eventually there’s going to need to be a tie-up between a telco and a cable company.” Sprint shares rose 4.2 percent to $5.99 in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.

277, ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Altice USA will sell mobile service on wireless carrier Sprint Corp’s network under a new multi-year agreement announced on Sunday, becoming the latest firm to enter the wireless market in a bid to retain customers. The companies announced the agreement a day after Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc ended merger talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Altice, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, will use Sprint’s network to provide voice and data services in the United States. It gave no time line on when it will introduce such services. The deal will allow Sprint to use Altice’s cable infrastructure to transmit cellular data and develop a next-generation network, or 5G. Sprint and T-Mobile on Saturday called off merger talks to create a bigger U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders. That has left Sprint, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, to engineer a turnaround on its own. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s majority owner, said in a separate announcement on Sunday that it intended to increase its stake in Sprint but that it would keep ownership of outstanding common stock under 85 percent, a move that avoids triggering a tender offer for the remaining shares. SoftBank currently owns roughly 82 percent of Sprint. U.S. cable companies have begun venturing into the wireless market as a way to bundle more services to reduce churn, or customer defections, at a time when more consumers are canceling cable subscriptions. Comcast Corp started selling wireless service this year on Verizon Communications Inc’s network, and Charter Communications Inc plans to launch service next year. ","

Rumors are spreading that the merger being negotiated by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) is hitting a rough patch right now, months after the companies first started talking, and just as the two were expected to expected to seal the deal. According to reports, Sprint majority stakeholder SoftBank Group, and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG can't agree on how much control each would receive in the deal; CNBC is reporting Deutsche Telecom's management may visit SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son this weekend to smooth things over. You may remember that Sprint and T-Mobile considered a deal back in 2014 that would have resulted in Sprint buying out T-Mobile, but those talks ended when the prospect of a merger met with strong resistance from regulators. If the Sprint and T-Mobile deal falls apart for good this time, it's unlikely the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers will try a third time. As Sprint and T-Mobile try to keep their merger talks alive, let's take a quick look at two possible alternatives for Sprint if the deal doesn't work out. Image source: Getty Images. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could be a strong contender to make a bid for Sprint, mainly because the cable company just jumped into the mobile wireless business earlier this year. Comcast only offers wireless services to its Xfinity Internet subscribers, and buying Sprint would significantly expand the cable company's reach. And even if Comcast doesn't want to become the nation's fourth-largest wireless carrier, the cable company could always purchase some of Sprint's spectrum, and sell it off later. Comcast made a similar move several years ago when it bought up wireless spectrum and later sold it to Verizon. What we do know is that Comcast is looking for new areas of growth as pay-TV subscriber numbers continue to decline. Research from Kagan estimates that by 2021, traditional TV providers will have lost 11 million subscribers nationwide. One hang-up for a potential Comcast deal is that it would need to be approved by Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Like Comcast, Charter announced plans for a mobile wireless service for its customers, and the two have teamed up, in a sense, to ensure they can test the mobile waters without competition from each other. To that end, they agreed that neither would make any wireless acquisitions without the other's consent. This could also open up another opportunity for Sprint, where both Charter and Comcast buy some of Sprint, and the mobile carrier uses the cash to continue building out its business. Charter and Comcast had pursued a similar scenario over the summer, but it never materialized as Sprint opted to pursue a deal with T-Mobile. It's also possible that Sprint could get snatched up by DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH). DISH been aggressively buying up swaths of wireless spectrum -- it purchased $6.2 billion worth in the latest wireless auction alone. So there's been lots of talk about DISH either buying or being bought by a wireless provider, and a collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile deal would only fuel further speculation. DISH is expected to launch an Internet of Things network -- for bringing small, data-sipping devices online -- in the next few years, but a deal with Sprint would instantly make DISH a key player in the mobile market, and give it even greater opportunities to utilize its wireless spectrum. Though it looks like T-Mobile and Sprint are trying to salvage their deal, anything could happen at this point. What's clear, though, is that Sprint is very interested in being bought. The carrier has worked hard to improve its business recently -- Sprint posted its highest operating income in 10 years in its latest quarter -- but the company's position in the U.S. wireless market isn't nearly as strong as it used to be. Sprint isn't likely to give up on the idea of being acquired if its deal with T-Mobile were to fall apart -- again. ","

These days, it's hard to find a stock more beaten down than Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). The regional telecom's shares have been absolutely hammered over the past few years -- to the point where they're touching the lowest they've been in over three decades. That's quite a dive. Let's take a closer look to determine if Frontier might be able to pick itself up from the floor and get its stock moving higher again. Frontier stock's latest major price swoon began in early 2015, very shortly after the company agreed to pay over $10.5 billion to acquire a big set of Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) assets in Florida, California, and Texas. That was the second monster deal between the two companies; in 2009, Frontier parted with $8.6 billion to buy similar assets in 14 states. Image source: Getty Images. When the 2015 deal closed last year, Frontier took over approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband accounts, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers formerly owned by Verizon. At a stroke, Frontier doubled its size, and then some. The company placed this massive bet because, in the words of CEO Daniel McCarthy, ""[i]t significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" The problem was that this flew in the face of two major trends: cord-cutting and what we can call broadband migration. The former is the well-known practice of ditching traditional pay-TV providers like FiOS for a smorgasbord of streaming services. The latter, which is related to cord-cutting, refers to customers moving to cable internet from the DSL technology delivered over phone lines. This isn't only a Frontier problem; it's been prevalent throughout the telecom industry. Yet the company was particularly vulnerable to it because of its size and scope -- it's much smaller, as you can see below, than top peers Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). Compounding that, unlike those giants, Frontier doesn't have other significant business units (like AT&T's DirecTV) that it can mobilize to help make up for the declining revenue. FTR Market Cap data by YCharts. Since the latest Verizon deal closed, the purchased customer base in Florida, California, and Texas has eroded in every quarter. And for more than a year, the company's revenue has dropped from quarter to quarter, with the bottom line landing consistently in the red. A deep (62%) dividend cut earlier this year shored up the finances somewhat; unfortunately, it also gave investors a solid reason to abandon or avoid the shares. A subsequent reverse stock split saved the company from an embarrassing delisting but ultimately couldn't halt the share price slide. It's been quite a tumble. From the start of this year alone, Frontier's stock has plummeted by almost 83%. It's hard to see how Frontier can crawl its way out of this. It invested heavily in technology its customers don't seem to want much these days, and there's no backup revenue source. The dividend, even at the drastically reduced rate, yields an insane 27%. That's not a sign of financial strength, nor does it indicate a deep bargain find -- it's a flashing red light for a company that's in deep trouble. I can't imagine any scenario in which Frontier stock rebounds from even this drastically reduced level. I very much doubt this will be a recovery story. ","

282,Daniel B. Kline,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2014, regulatory opposition forced Sprint (NYSE:S) to give up on its plan to acquire T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Three years later, the two companies returned to the negotiating table, coming close to finalizing an agreement before the deal hit roadblocks once again. What happened? And what lies ahead for the No. 3 and 4 wireless providers? A full transcript follows the video. Dan Kline: Nice to be here! Shen: Are you in town this time for any special occasion? Kline: I was speaking to potential college journalists -- well, I guess, they're actual college journalists who want to be professional journalists. I got to give them the scary ""our profession is not as good as it was,"" but there are wonderful places like Motley Fool where, if you can make your way here eventually, it'll be good for you. It was actually organized by a former Fool, as well. Shen: There you go. Today, Fools, for our main subject of discussion, we're branching out into the telecommunications industry for this episode. You'll have a chance, Dan, to share some of your coverage there. It's been a while since we've talked about this space, but I understand that T-Mobile and Sprint have been making headlines in the past several months, this whole ordeal. Those companies are the No. 3 and No. 4 names, respectively, among U.S. wireless providers. Before we dive into the recent news around their potential merger and how that's fallen through, I want to talk about some of the background for the two companies, and I think that will help once we get into the nitty gritty of the recent news, in terms of understanding some of their motivations and the various incentives that are at play here. Let's start with T-Mobile. The company, I think, is probably best known for two things -- its CEO, John Legere, and also its Un-carrier branding, which I think has been very successful for the company. Kline: And it's not just branding. When John Legere took over, and he's a very bombastic guy, I always likened him to a 1980s pro-wrestling manager. He's very in your face, he'll taunt you, he'll call out his opposition, he has nicknames. Sort of a fun version of what the president likes to do. So what they did with Un-carrier is, he looked at every consumer pain point in the mobile process. So the first big one was contracts. You'd be tied into this two-year contract, you would have a device subsidy, you wouldn't know what you were really paying for anything. They got rid of that. The more recent ones are having only unlimited data. Yes, I know there's caveats, they slow you down after 22 gigs, but that's 2% of the audience. For most people, completely unlimited data. And every few months, they come out with something new, and it's silly stuff. T-Mobile Tuesday is just like, this Tuesday I get a free Frosty at Wendy's. But last month, they came out with, ""We're giving all of our customers Netflix."" So they're really trying to find a way to be different, to be a customer first mobile company. And it's worked. T-Mobile has added over a million subscribers for 18 straight quarters. And as John Legere likes to say, they've had all the growth in the wireless space. Shen: Legere started his role at T-Mobile in late 2012. They rolled out the first Un-carrier Initiative 1.0, they called it at the time, not much later, I believe it was March of 2013. So in that time, as you mentioned, the company has seen some pretty strong results. I think customers and listeners will realize that a lot of the things that they enjoy now, maybe even take for granted when they look through their wireless bill, was often a byproduct of the competition coming from these various Un-carrier moves. Kline: T-Mobile has forced AT&T and Verizon, and to a lesser extent Sprint, because Sprint wasn't quite as evil as AT&T and Verizon were acting in some of their no-longer practices, but the big one was overages. It's hard to quantify how much we were paying in overages, because they function in two ways. There's the actual, ""I go over my data allotment and have to pay."" That was billions of dollars. But Legere would always talk about the person who bought a too-big plan, because they didn't want to worry about it, and that was perhaps tens of billions of dollars that was getting sucked out of consumers' pockets. So by being transparent and saying, ""We're not going to do those kind of things"" -- T-Mobile was No. 4 and sinking, and since 2013, now they're No. 3 and rising. And they've been picking up momentum pretty much every quarter. The challenge is, as Verizon, AT&T, everybody's prices have come down, everybody offers unlimited, Sprint is really cheap, the challenge is, how do you keep doing that when maybe a lot of those pain points are gone? Shen: Yeah. At the end of 2013, which was, again, the year the Un-carrier program started, T-Mobile had 46 million customers, they had a churn of about 1.7% per month. Now, as of the most recently reported quarter, that's Q3 for 2017, reported just October 23, they have 71 million customers, great growth there. Their churn is down to 1.2%, seeing very consistent progress with that core metric for this industry. Some other notable highlights, from that approximately four-year period, to note, under the leadership of Legere, they moved, as you said, from the No. 4 to the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier. Of course, that gap -- Kline: It's a huge gap. Shen: -- is a massive one. So it's really AT&T against Verizon at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, and then T-Mobile and Sprint at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively. They've had 18 straight quarters of more than one million net customer additions, which I think you mentioned, Dan. They've had compound annual top line growth of almost 14% for that period, improving profitability. T-Mobile shares have gained over 200%, so stockholders are pretty happy with the Un-carrier. Let's turn our attention now to Sprint. What have been the big themes or drivers for this company in recent memory? Because they're not doing nearly as well. Kline: Sprint is doing better, but Sprint was a sinking ship. It was losing ground as T-Mobile was gaining ground, because it had no identity. It was just the carrier that's a little cheaper than AT&T and Verizon, but not quite as cheap as T-Mobile. Marcelo Claure, their CEO, who is willing to go toe-to-toe with John Legere, he sort of righted the ship, but the way he's done it is heavy discounting. So Sprint is almost always, at some point, the best deal. And when I say some point, I mean, maybe it's families this week, maybe it's individuals next week. They're not always the lowest across the board for every type of plan you would want. But they generally have some crazy deal that would be good for somebody. They do things like two iPhones for one. So they've returned to slight growth in terms of subscribers, but it's not necessarily sustainable, because a lot of their promotions sunset. So March 2018, you no longer pay $30 a month, now you pay $55. And it's so easy to move now, which makes the T-Mobile churn number even more impressive. It's no longer the days where moving was a big challenge and it was hard to get your number. Now, it's very easy. You could switch cellphone providers every three months if you wanted to, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. So Sprint is on better ground, but they haven't spent a lot of money on their network, which is a problem. They will argue that they're within 1% of the other networks, and that's not really what the data shows. Shen: In terms of the coverage and the network quality. Kline: Yeah. And the reality is, they're the No. 4 network, generally, on most of the accepted standards. There's all sorts of different data and different ways you can parse things, but it's pretty widely accepted that Sprint is the worst, and it's going to get worse as they don't spend money, which is part of why they might like to be for sale. Shen: And as of the most recent quarterly report, Sprint has added postpaid subscribers for nine straight quarters. They did see their highest postpaid additions in company history. So some positive marks, as you mentioned. They also cut a ton of costs year to date. I believe it's yielded savings of $750 million. Kline: It's price, as well, with postpaid. Boost Mobile tends to be the cheapest. So they might be cannibalizing their own customer base, because you can port your Sprint phone to a Boost Mobile phone with zero effort and pay less. Shen: The cost-cutting efforts are definitely a focus for management right now. They're improving their profitability, but at this point, that company has still reported negative earnings for several years running. And on the not so bright side, the stock is down about 30% year-to-date, and quite a bit today, last I checked before we came into the studio, because the negotiations for this T-Mobile-Sprint deal are officially over. The press release from both companies came out on Saturday. The stock in general has been seesawing between $3 to $10 per share, essentially, for the past five years. I feel like the cost-cutting and the slowly improving business, or the gradual turnaround that Claure is working on here, it's one part of the puzzle. As you mentioned earlier, the company needs to generate so much cash -- any company in this industry needs to generate so much cash each year to reinvest in the wireless network, to not only just match your competitors in terms of what service you offer, but then you have, for example, 5G networks on the horizon, people already starting to test the infrastructure for that. Kline: Buying spectrum. Shen: And that's just another demand in terms of resources that you have to satisfy. Kline: If you look at what Sprint is doing, they're cleaning up the asset for a sale, a merger, a partnership, whatever it ends up being. We'll talk about that later. But you're not going to make a deal with something that's bleeding customers, that's losing billions of dollars. So if you can take the loss to pretty much zero, and it was a relatively minor loss in the last quarter, and be putting the subscriber needle in the right direction, you're at least showing, whether it's a partner or a buyer or however it comes down, ""Hey, there's a bottom here. We're not going to go to zero."" And there was a while where it looked like every Sprint customer was just going to become a T-Mobile customer. Shen: We'll take a closer look at the deal negotiations between the two companies and how that panned out. We'll talk about that next. So now you have some high-level perspective of these two companies, where they are and where they've been the past couple of years. So we can talk about the deal that just wasn't meant to be. It's the second time now, right? So on Saturday, November 4, Sprint and T-Mobile pushed out the press releases announcing the end of their merger negotiations. Dan, I feel like on this show, we've talked several times about these long, drawn-out ordeals. We've talked about Viacom, their leadership battle, we've talked about the Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's merger being this long, drawn-out saga. And now, we have this last one here. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how things progressed in the last few months, how they started up and how they ended? Kline: There are logical reasons for these companies to get together. You put their subscriber bases together, and it's about equal to either AT&T or Verizon. So it gives them scale. You can lay off a lot of customer service people, a lot of accountants. Shen: Redundant functions, yeah. Kline: You don't need two networks. There were also some major drawbacks. I didn't want this deal to happen, because I remember when Sprint bought Nextel, when Nextel was essentially No. 5 in the wireless space. Nextel used a different technology than Sprint. As Sprint and T-Mobile are not on the same network technologies. Your Sprint phone can not become a T-Mobile phone. That was the case with the Nextel phone and the Sprint phone. So you're buying something that's not super easy to integrate. It's not like they can just become Spree Mobile, and all of the sudden it's just one company. [laughs] I got one up on you there, we were talking about how this would be named before the show. Shen: Spree Mobile is pretty good. I was going to go with T-Sprint, but I like this more. Kline: There were a lot of operational challenges, but the reality on this is, the best deals are when one company wants out. The Cabela's management knew they weren't coming along with the deal. They were all going to cash out, make some money, go fishing or hunting or whatever it is Cabela's management would do. In this case, SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF), which is the parent company of Sprint, wanted to maintain certain rights and control. They were going to give up the CEO post, John Legere would have that, but they still wanted more management than what they were bringing to the table in terms of valuation offered. That becomes a very dicey deal to make. Shen: To be clear, in terms of the parties that have an interest in these deal negotiations, on one side, with T-Mobile, their majority interest stake is held by Deutsche Telekom, about a 65% ownership stake, I believe. And on the opposite side of the negotiation table, you have Sprint, which is over 80% owned by SoftBank and the billionaire Masayoshi Son. He's been a big part of the direction, the vision for Sprint, these various efforts. He actually tried to have Sprint take over T-Mobile back in 2014 -- Kline: When it might have made sense for Sprint. They were still No. 3, they were the bigger company. Shen: And that deal fell through, because the indication, I believe, that they received from the regulatory body that would overlook and scrutinize the deal was, ""This is not going to happen."" Kline: They flat out said, ""We will not accept any deal that takes the U.S. market from four providers to three providers."" Shen: In this case, we have a new administration now, obviously, and I believe that both parties thought they had a situation where regulators might be more friendly to a deal of this nature. Whether that's the case, again, you're going from four to three major players -- Kline: I think the argument they were going to make is that Comcast and Charter are all somewhat in this, or going into this space, with their own wifi-based MVNO networks, which are networks that don't own their spectrum, they lease it from one of the remaining companies. Shen: Essentially piggybacking off of the companies that have actually developed the infrastructure. Kline: Yeah. And I think they were going to give caveats that they would license their spectrum to X amount of payers. They were going to argue that there were legitimately more choices for Americans than the three or four or whatever you want to call it. I don't know that that would have flown. But I do think the reality is, there were a lot of reasons this deal shouldn't happen, and once it wasn't quick, I think you knew it wasn't going to happen. Shen: Then, you mentioned this too, in terms of what the combined entity would look like, 130 million customers, pretty much on par with AT&T and Verizon. They'd have about $75 billion in annual revenue. Definitely a much more formidable player. Kline: The cost savings would be extraordinary. Shen: But the integrations, as you said, would not nearly be that simple or that seamless. And if you're a customer with either Sprint or T-Mobile and this deal had come together, it wouldn't have been so quick for you to see improvements in your service, and that just comes from the challenge of combining two huge national networks, but they're on different LTE technology. Kline: Because there are no contracts anymore, I think there's a very big risk, and I think we saw this with Frontier Communications, which spent $11 billion buying customers from Verizon, and when it didn't very quickly work well, they didn't get billed right, their service didn't work, their internet wasn't good, whatever it was, they just went, ""Oh, I'm going to go to Comcast."" It's easier to switch your wireless phone than it is to switch your cable service. No one has to come to your house. You can just walk into a Sprint store and they'll give you a bag to mail it back to T-Mobile. It's very simple. So you could have spent, whatever it is in terms of stock, billions and billions of dollars, to take Sprint's 50 million customers, it's a little bit more than that, but the 71 million at T-Mobile, and you could lose 10% in the first three months. And I think that's what would have happened. Everybody's prices are too close together. You would also have to deal with, the pricing structures are different at Sprint and T-Mobile. Are they all going to go to one? Are they going to stay two separate brands? That doesn't make sense from a pricing perspective. So to me, it always made more sense for either of these brands to partner with a cable company or someone else in an adjacent space. Shen: And we can get to that idea. You have these two companies, they tried coming together in 2014. At the time, Sprint was the larger player, in more of the power position. Now, the tables have turned, and T-Mobile has more of the leverage. When it comes down to it, SoftBank, what they had in mind for a deal like this, they didn't want to give up too much control of the future of Spree Mobile, as you called it. Kline: It's also the assets. Masayoshi Son has been spending hundreds of billions of dollars, I forget the exact amount in his tech fund, but it's at least $100 billion. And all of the spectrum assets that Sprint owns, he doesn't want to give up control over, because maybe he'll use it to launch a national over the top cable service. I mean, I'm just making that up, but he wants to be able to pick the company clean for parts. It's not necessarily about the wireless subscribers or that business. I think he was perfectly happy to let John Legere decide what the commercials and the pricing were going to be. It's all the future integration of, does T-Mint or Spree Mobile or whatever we're going to call them, do they merge with Comcast? I think those are the things he wasn't willing to let go. And I think John Legere has earned the right to say, ""I don't want to have a boss anymore."" And that was going to be a sticking point. Shen: So differences in terms of what the controlling stake would look like, the ownership between the two companies and their shareholders and this combined entity. And then, also coming down to valuation as well, Sprint's stock took quite a hit in September. I think it went down about 20%. And then, depending on the timing of the deal, it could be that Sprint shareholders didn't see any kind of premium in the merger. Kline: It's all speculation, because they haven't talked about this, but there have been a lot of reports saying they weren't offering a premium, and it was about efficiency and unlocking value. That's a tough one to sell. But Sprint didn't help itself by, before this negotiation started, they had an exclusive negotiating period with Charter and Comcast about a partnership, a merger. They never exactly announced what it was. But it became pretty clear that there weren't two suitors. So T-Mobile did not have to say, ""We'll pay you 40% more,"" because otherwise, you're going to turn around and, I don't know, McDonald's is going to buy you and use it for mobile ordering. And we'll talk about this soon, there could be somebody out there, but the reason prices drive up in these kinds of deals is, ""If you don't buy us, Amazon will."" And Sprint is a complicated asset. Shen: Some other suitor, sure. So let's wrap up our discussion. The deal is no longer happening, off the table as far as we know. These two companies are going to continue to make their investments, operate independently. Let's look at Sprint first. What do you think lies ahead that investors and listeners should be following for this company? Kline: Well, it won't be McDonald's. [laughs] And, Sprintpotle is also not on the table. Sprint, in my opinion, is going to be sold to a cable company. I think it makes a lot of sense if you're already in the subscription business, you already have that infrastructure for this to be another bundle. I don't think Comcast actually wants to offer a leased service, mostly on wifi, vaguely not that good, nobody wants its phone service. Shen: Which they recently had with Xfinity Mobile. Kline: Yeah. And did it, and Altice has now just signed a deal this week to do it using Sprint's lines. I think they're going to want to have a service they can sell nationally. And it may not be a merger, it may be some sort of exclusive partnership with an investment to take some of the pressure off. But they also have all of the spectrum assets, some of which are saleable if they don't need them. So I think that's going to make the most sense, and you just have to see how that industry is going to shake out. Are Charter and Comcast going to merge? Shen: Do you see it as, Sprint is grooming itself for another suitor to come in? Kline: Yeah, I think Sprint has to continue to show -- even if they can eke out a profit, it's a lot easier to buy something that's revenue-neutral than buy something that's revenue-negative. If you're going to sell this to Charter shareholders or Comcast shareholders or whoever it is, I think Sprint could do more to cut costs. They could be more of a position to integrate quickly. And that's probably going to mean a lot of discounting, good for consumers, and a lot of barebones staffing, not so good for consumers. Shen: Let's look at T-Mobile, then. They're still doing incredibly well, claiming a lot of the growth that this industry is seeing overall, no longer combining with Sprint. What are the big next steps for them? Keep going with the Un-carrier initiatives? It seems to be getting harder and harder for them to set themselves apart with that. Kline: Deutsche Telekom would probably rather not have to keep investing. It's spent like $40 billion in the last six years, or something like that. Shen: In terms of the network for T-Mobile. Kline: In terms of the network and building out capacity. And that's not going to change with 5G and all the other things. So, I think they're open to a deal. I think there's also the possibility that someone like an Altice, a company that's European-based or one of the companies in other parts of the world, that there might be some synergy in either merging with T-Mobile or joint operating, and having a more global company. Again, standards and technology become a challenge there. But I think T-Mobile is in a position where they can sit back, and as long as John Legere doesn't retire, they're in a very good position to just wait for the best deal, see if Amazon or Apple wants to buy them. Shen: OK. So for both instances, you see some form of consolidation or M&A deal being potential things to watch. Kline: I don't think it has to be -- Shen: Because, my take was more so for Sprint, for sure. Kline: The Sprint original deal they talked about was Comcast and Charter was an investment plus, essentially, becoming their wireless company. I think that type of deal is actually more logical for T-Mobile, for a healthy company to say, ""Now we're going to offer service in Mexico through Wal-Mart,"" those types of deals, I think, make more sense with a healthy company than they do with an ailing company. But there is so much negative to owning Sprint that there might be big players like Comcast more willing to have it be an investment in a partnership, rather than an outright purchase. Shen: Alright. That wraps up our discussion for this deal. We'll continue to track the progress for Sprint's turnaround, for how T-Mobile decides to proceed with their next Un-carrier initiative, for example, as these two companies make those announcements in due time.

    The Sprint and T-Mobile Merger Falls Apart for a Second Time -- The Motley Fool

283,Adam Levy,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T) are three of the big names in the U.S. wireless industry. In recent years, Sprint has been putting pressure on the economics of the two giants -- Verizon and AT&T -- in the form of aggressive pricing and other competitive moves like early adoption of equipment installment plans and smartphone leases. What's more, while AT&T and Verizon are investing in areas outside of their core wireless businesses, Sprint is focused exclusively on wireless. Investors may be wondering whether Sprint makes a better buy than a stalwart like AT&T or Verizon. Or if Verizon and AT&T are better positioned, which of them is best among the three wireless carriers. Let's examine each one a bit more closely to determine which stock is the best buy. Image source: Verizon. Sprint is a big fan of pointing out that the gap between its network coverage and Verizon's has gotten much narrower in recent years. That said, Verizon still consistently earns the highest grades in third-party network quality tests. But even its strong network hasn't stopped it from feeling pricing pressure. It saw 11 straight quarters of declining service revenue before things started turning around last quarter. It was practically forced to start offering an unlimited data plan. Then it quickly moved to offering two tiers of unlimited data to help control its cost of services and compete on price. All of its efforts have paid off. In the first two full quarters since introducing its unlimited plan, Verizon has added over 200,000 postpaid phone subscribers after several quarters of disappointing net additions (and losses). Service revenue is starting to turn around, as management forecast, and subscriber churn levels remain the lowest in the industry. Verizon has taken steps to expand beyond wireless with its digital media business, Oath. It also has a wireline business providing internet, video, and landline service. Still, it hasn't resorted to measures as drastic as AT&T, which has made big acquisitions in the form of DirecTV and Time Warner in recent years. It's still strapped with a boatload of debt from its buyout of a minority stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014. Image source: Sprint. With a wireless network that consistently ranks at the bottom of third-party measurement surveys, Sprint has resorted to aggressive pricing to win over customers. This summer, for example, it started offering free service to new customers, particularly targeting Verizon subscribers. For its efforts, Sprint has started to see new customers come on board. The company's share of gross subscriber additions reached an all-time high last quarter, according to management. Its 367,000 net postpaid phone subscriber additions still fall short of Verizon's, though. What's more, unlike Verizon or AT&T, Sprint is losing postpaid connected device subscribers. Sprint's aggressive pricing is also putting pressure on its service revenue. Through the first half of fiscal 2018, postpaid service revenue is down 7%. That's worse than Verizon, which has notably struggled to sustain its service revenue. Image source: AT&T. AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV and its pending acquisition of Time Warner have put it in a position to offer an aggressively priced entertainment bundle with its wireless service. Unlimited plan subscribers get free HBO and $25 off one of AT&T's video services. The plan hasn't stopped it from losing postpaid phone subscribers, which declined another 97,000 last quarter. Overall, service revenue fell 2.8% year over year last quarter, and average revenue per postpaid subscriber fell 3.5%. Meanwhile, AT&T is bleeding video subscribers as well. The company lost 89,000 video subscribers, with nearly 300,000 U-Verse and DirecTV subscribers replaced by DirecTV Now subscribers -- AT&T's streaming video service. That said, AT&T's been able to continue raising prices for its linear TV services to maintain slight revenue growth. Sprint doesn't have a competitive advantage beyond lower pricing. If the company continues to rely on undercutting AT&T and Verizon to win customers, it will be difficult for it to generate enough cashflow to build out its network and provide a more competitive service. It's currently about break-even on a free-cash-flow basis. Comparatively, Verizon and AT&T are cash-flow giants. Verizon generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and AT&T produced $16.5 billion. Verizon's free cash flow was negatively impacted by a $3.2 billion tax bill on the sale of some of its wireline assets and the decision to shift to an asset-backed bond to pull forward revenue from its equipment installment plans. Adjusting for those factors, Verizon's cash flow is comparable to AT&T's. The free cash flows of Verizon and AT&T support big dividend yields of 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Perhaps the best valuation metric for comparing the wireless carriers is EV to EBITDA. Here's how the three stack up. Company EV to EBITDA Multiple Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.5 Sprint 5.5 Table source: Yahoo! Finance. Investors should note that Sprint's EBITDA is comparably higher due to the fact that it uses device leasing. Instead of expensing devices, Sprint capitalizes them and then amortizes them over time. This results in a higher EBITDA than if devices showed up in cost of goods sold, like they do with Verizon and AT&T. As such, Sprint's lower EV-to-EBITDA multiple isn't very impressive. Verizon is actually growing its subscriber base and isn't bogged down with a declining pay-TV business. As such, it deserves a slight premium to AT&T. On the other hand, AT&T offers a higher dividend yield, supported by massive free cash flow. For investors looking for more exposure to the U.S. wireless industry, Verizon is the best buy. If you're comfortable with lots of exposure to the declining pay-TV market, AT&T presents better value. I'd stay away from Sprint, though. ","

Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) reported solid third-quarter 2017 results after the market closed on Wednesday. Shares have returned 31.9% in 2017 through Wednesday, versus the S&P 500's 17.1%. Here's how the quarter worked out for the data center operator and global interconnection specialist that's organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue Operating income $224.9 million $170.0 million Net income $79.9 million $51.5 million 55% Earnings per share (EPS) $1.02 $0.72 Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)* $391.3 million $284.2 million AFFO per share $4.97 $3.95 Data source: Equinix. *AFFO is a closely watched metric for companies organized as REITs, as it's a driver of payouts to shareholders. It's akin to ""earnings"" for REITs. Reported revenue got a boost from foreign exchange and includes $137 million of revenue from the acquisition of 29 Verizon data centers, which was completed last quarter. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenue increased 10% year over year -- still quite solid -- and 8% from the previous quarter. Equinix's revenue came in above its guidance range of $1,133 million to $1,141 million. The company doesn't provide a quarterly AFFO outlook. Image source: Getty Images. Here's what CEO Steve Smith had to say in the press release about the quarter: Equinix had a strong third quarter as customers continue to adopt interconnection oriented architectures as the preferred platform for their shift to digital. Robust demand is driving higher utilization levels, and we are investing in support of this momentum with expansions, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, to deliver even greater value to customers through our global platform. As customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice, our interconnection strength is resonating, and Equinix continues to outpace market growth and gain market share. Equinix increased its full-year 2017 guidance. The company said the $37 million (at midpoint) guidance raise is due to better-than-expected operating performance of $8 million in the third quarter, additional foreign currency benefit of $16 million when compared to the prior guidance, and $13 million in revenue from two acquisitions it made early in the fourth quarter.

Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW) is enjoying a very good year. While its stock price is up nearly 30% year to date, nearly doubling the S&P 500's return, its impressive run looks to continue for some time yet, judging by its recently reported third-quarter results. While its core sales and core EPS growth were modest on the surface, at 6% and 2%, respectively, closer inspection reveals a lot for Corning shareholders to be excited about. The market seemed to like the quarter, too, as the company's stock price jumped more than 6% the day it reported. We don't have to look far to see why investors were so impressed. Corning's optical communications division -- which manufactures optical fiber and provides connectivity solutions for some of the world's largest telecom networks and cable providers -- showed strong year-over-year core earnings growth of 13% and this division is Corning's second-largest income-earning division. (""Core"" numbers are management's favored adjusted financial metrics that it believes best express how the company is performing. For instance, it excludes the impact that foreign exchange rates had on the quarter's numbers.) Better yet, management stated that the earnings for this division would have been even higher if it hadn't been reinvesting so much back into the business to increase manufacturing capacity. While Corning's specialty materials division, the home of Gorilla Glass, saw even stronger sales and earnings growth, its optical communications business segment is where Corning might be building a nearly unbreachable moat against competitors. Corning is now the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber and offers a number of award-winning innovations in the market. Image source: Corning Inc. In the company's recent quarterly press release, it announced that it had now produced 1 billion kilometers of optical fiber. That's a whole lot! In fact, according to the company, that's ""one-third of the optical fiber ever produced in the history of the world."" This accomplishment comes on the heels of a major deal with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) whereby the telecom carrier announced that it will buy more than $1.05 billion of optical fiber over the next three years from Corning. In the company's conference call, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks talked not only about why even better things are still ahead. According to the transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence, he said: Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind, anywhere in the world. ... We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate and to increase our market access. ... These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry ... We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020. That Corning is the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber gives it an impressive economic moat against its competitors. Beyond that, the company also offers a variety of innovative solutions. For instance, the company's EDGE8 solution is a preterminated optical cabling system designed specifically for data centers. EDGE8 allows data center operators to maximize their assets without the need for conversion modules, leading to lower costs. It also provides a straightforward path for data centers to upgrade to 40G, 100G, or 400G ethernet. Corning showed strength in its optical communication division in its recently reported third quarter. Data source: Corning Inc. 2017 Q3 2017 earnings. Some might counter that while Corning's optical communications segment's results were impressive, the company still only managed to increase earnings by 2% companywide. However, this argument misses the larger point: Corning has transformed itself from a cyclical industrial company dependent on commodity pricing to an enterprise with incredible technical prowess and proprietary know-how in diverse areas. The company's largest income-generating division, display technologies, accounted for 52% of the company's core earnings this quarter. This business segment largely manufactures specialized glass substrates used as a key component in liquid crystal displays for devices such as smartphones, computer monitors, and large-screen televisions. Earnings in this business segment are notoriously cyclical and are often based on glass prices, a factor far outside Corning's control. This quarter, core earnings in this department fell 16% year over year. In years past, that would have tanked Corning's quarter. While display technologies still comprises slightly more than half of Corning's earnings, it's not nearly as big, percentage-wise, as it was previously. That core earnings in this division could have fallen by so much while the company still eked out a small core earnings gain shows just how far Corning has come in increasing its other streams of revenue. For shareholders, there's a lot to like not only about Corning's latest quarter, but its incredible transformation as a company. Not the least of things to like is Corning's growing moat in optical fiber manufacturing. With innovative solutions and lowest-cost production capabilities, Corning expects to continue to grow this division at twice the rate of the telecommunications industry and is projecting at least $5 billion in sales in this segment by 2020. Optical communications had about $3 billion in net sales in 2016.  Corning is setting itself up for long-term success. ","

Retirees count on safe, dividend-paying stocks for regular income and to protect their wealth. Though they may not necessarily be the most exciting stocks on the market, these types of investments are just what people in their golden years need to avoid risk and reap the rewards of their portfolios. While the market's high valuation has made it harder to find high dividend yields, there are still some good opportunities in the market. Below, three of our analysts discuss their picks for high-yield safe stocks, including National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (National Retail Properties): A real estate investment trust (REIT) can be a great addition to a retirement portfolio. These investment vehicles receive special tax treatment, avoiding typical corporate taxes, and in return are required to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. As a result, REITs typically produce higher yields than many other dividend stocks. National Retail Properties invests in single-tenant net leased retail properties, which requires its tenants to pay for the operating expenses of their locations, including taxes, maintenance, and insurance. With fewer expenses, the company has more profits to return to shareholders. What makes National Retail Properties even more compelling is the composition of its portfolio. You might be concerned about the trend away from brick-and-mortar retail, as more and more shoppers make purchases online. This company avoids shopping centers and strip malls, and its tenants typically offer services that can't be duplicated online, like restaurants, convenience stores, automotive service centers, and fitness centers. National Retail Properties has initial lease terms of between 15 and 20 years, with contractual rent increases built into each lease. This provides reliable growth for its portfolio, which consists of 2,675 properties, with over 400 tenants in 48 states. Its strategy results in higher renewal rates and consistently high occupancy rates, currently at 99.3%. Over the last 25 years the company has produced an average total return of 13.5%. National Retail Properties has increased its dividend in each of the last 28 consecutive years, and is currently yielding 4.5%. Daniel Miller (Iron Mountain): Ironically, retirees looking for a safe investment won't need to look much further than a company built to protect information. Iron Mountain, which received IRS approval to operate as a REIT in 2014, is a global leader in record storage. In fact, it provides its services to roughly 94% of Fortune 1,000 companies, and has more than 1,400 facilities dedicated to storing information for record-intensive industries -- think healthcare, law, and finance-type industries. While Iron Mountain might be a new name to many investors, it's a trusted name in data management and offers consumers a compelling option to reduce the costs and risks of storing and protecting information assets. It's a safe investment due in part to its high retention of customers, low turnover and low maintenance capital expenditures. Going forward, management plans to grow the business by expanding into emerging markets as they begin requiring more data management, as well as adjacent businesses such as art storage. There will always be global demand for secure data management options, and what's even better for retirees looking for stable income is that REITs are required by law to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. Currently Iron Mountain's dividend yield sits at 5.8%, making it a great option for investors seeking income. Jeremy Bowman (Verizon Communications): There may be no safer sector than telecom, a highly regulated oligopoly with a captive market, and no telecom company is more dominant than Verizon.  The nation's biggest wireless provider offers investors a defensive stock with a 4.8% dividend yield and a low P/E of just 12.3. As a provider of necessary services like phone and data, Verizon will fare considerably better than the broad market in a recession, and the company has plenty of room to raise its dividend as its payout ratio is a reasonable 59%. The company has also increased its dividends for 11 years in a row. While Verizon has struggled to grow earnings in a competitive market, the company continues to add subscribers, with 603,000 additions in the most recent quarter, and is seeing growth in Fios and its new media business Oath, which came from the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo. As consolidation continues in the telecom and media industries Verizion should benefit, and could add other assets to its media business. The proliferation of wearables like smartwatches should also help grow revenue over the coming years. With a leading position in its industry, a defensive business model, and a strong and growing dividend, Verizon is great choice for retirees in search of safety. ","

Retirement is when most people are assumed to be living on a ""fixed income."" Well, yes, Social Security checks can remain fixed for a few years, though they do rise over time to keep up with inflation. Some other income sources, such as bonds, might also offer fixed income. Fortunately, though, there are plenty of ways that you can increase your retirement income, to make it less fixed. You can even employ a Social Security strategy or two to make your future checks bigger. Image source: Getty Images. Here are eight ways to increase your retirement income. This is probably not the kind of tip you wanted to see, but it's a powerful one. If you can work a few more years than you originally planned to, there are multiple benefits: Your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it -- and it will have to support you for fewer years. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). The table below shows what a difference an extra year or two can make in your investing -- if you're socking away $10,000 annually and it's growing by an annual average of 8%: Growing at 8% For: $10,000 Invested Annually 15 years $293,243 16 years $327,502 17 years $364,502 18 years $404,463 19 years $447,620 20 years $494,229 21 years $544,568 22 years $598,933 23 years $657,648 24 years $721,059 25 years $789,544 26 years $863,508 27 years $943,388 28 years $1.0 million 29 years $1.1 million 30 years $1.2 million Data source: author. Instead of working longer, or in addition to doing so, you might also ease into retirement by working a little in your first few years of retirement. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. A part-time job can also give your days more structure and opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Be aware, though, that if you're planning to start collecting Social Security benefits before your full retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you want to work some then, too, your benefits may be reduced. As the Social Security Administration explains: ""If you're younger than full retirement age during all of 2017, we must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $16,920."" The year you reach your full retirement age, the earning limit jumps to $44,880, and the penalty decreases to $1 withheld for every $3 earned above the limit. Fortunately, though, the money withheld isn't lost. Instead, it's factored into the benefit checks you receive later, which end up increased. The health insurance coverage you choose can have an effect on how much you spend out of pocket on healthcare in retirement. (This is a big deal: According to Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend, on average, a total of $275,000 out of pocket on healthcare.) Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The table below shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: Growing For: Growing at 8% Growing at 10% Growing at 12% 15 years $161,284 $192,224 $229,643 20 years $271,826 $346,514 $443,843 25 years $434,239 $595,000 $821,337 30 years $672,900 $995,189 $1.5 million Data source: author. A 401(k) has even more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 and in 2018 it's 18.500 -- plus an additional $6,000 is allowed in both years for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and increasingly available Roth 401(k)s, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! Having a portfolio of stocks in retirement means you can sell shares for income at any time. But if you're holding dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! For example, a $300,000 portfolio with an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll likely receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield National Grid 6.2% AT&T 5.8% Verizon 4.9% Pfizer 3.7% AbbVie 3.1% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can serve you well, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.7%. Image source: Getty Images. Another way to boost your retirement income is to get it from the equity in your home -- via a reverse mortgage. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- such as when you move into a nursing home or die. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell the home unless they can afford to pay off the loan. Still, if you need additional income in retirement and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. You can increase your retirement income by spending less of it on home-related expenses. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, you can boost your retirement income by being savvy about strategies that can increase your Social Security income. For starters, you can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us. If you're married, you can maximize your benefits by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or as early as age 62, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks as survivor benefits instead of their own smaller checks. If you've figured out how much money you'll need in retirement and you're worried about how you'll generate the income you'll need, consider some of the strategies above. They can put hundreds or even thousands of dollars more in your pocket each year. ","

Mayer resigned in June after its acquisition by Verizon closed. She had been in the job for about five years. Mayer hadn’t wanted to testify, declining multiple requests. She appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday after US lawmakers subpoenaed her late last month, according to The Hill. A spokesperson for Mayer contested this version of events to The Hill, saying she was testifying voluntarily. On Wednesday, Mayer was seated in the center of the five-member panel of executives who appeared to testify on data breaches, which also included Richard Smith, the former Equifax CEO who “retired” shortly after the company disclosed a data breach that compromised the personal information of 143 million Americans. US lawmakers have grown increasingly skeptical of the power and intimate user details amassed by big technology companies. Representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter answered questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. That skepticism was on display as the Senate Commerce Committee questioned Mayer, with a key exchange occurring between her and senator Bill Nelson. Nelson: At this point, I’m wondering that there’s no such thing as data security. When you think of a sophisticated state actor such as China or Russia, your companies can’t stand up against them. The only person or institution that can stand up against them is the National Security Agency. And what we’re going to see in the future for not only personally identifiable information but also the state secrets of our country, many of which are critical infrastructure as represented by companies such as yours, there’s going to have to be a cooperation between the most sophisticated player in the United States, which is the NSA, and you all. Otherwise we, Americans, are not going to have any more privacy. And if we don’t do something, and if you all don’t do something to change this, we’re going to be right back here, on additional hearings, coming up on this same topic. Now Ms. Mayer, what do you think? You had a sophisticated state actor coming after you. How do you really think that you could have protected yourself? Mayer: Even robust defense and processes are not sufficient to protect against a state sponsored attack, especially one that’s extremely sophisticated and persistent. We at Yahoo cooperated with law enforcement and brought these breaches and intrusions to the attention of law enforcement, swiftly each time they were detected. And the DOJ and FBI were of great assistance to the company in identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Nelson: But that’s an admission that you’re not protected against a state actor. A few minutes later, speaking to an executive from Yahoo parent Verizon, Nelson added that protecting consumer privacy was “going to take an attitude change among companies such as yours.” ",Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was grilled by a senate committee over its massive data breach — Quartz,0.9933

The Senate Commerce Committee’s authorization of the subpoena, an unusual move, underscores lawmakers’ growing concern over data breaches. It also highlights the potential stakes for Mayer, once one of the nation’s most celebrated CEOs, in testifying about Yahoo’s massive data breaches and subsequent stumbles in disclosing them. The committee authorized its subpoena late last month after Mayer declined the panel’s invitation to testify voluntarily, according to committee aides. A committee spokesman and a representative for Mayer said Tuesday that she would testify at Wednesday’s hearing.

290,,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer apologized on Wednesday for two massive data breaches at the internet company, blaming Russian agents for at least one of them, at a hearing on the growing number of cyber attacks on major U.S. companies. “Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users’ data.” Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December. In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes. Those charges came amid controversy relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Donald Trump. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election in any way. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said in March the 2013 breach was unrelated and that an investigation of the larger incident was continuing. Mayer later said under questioning that she did not know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach, but earlier spoke of state-sponsored attacks. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, asked Mayer on Wednesday why it took three years to identify the data breach or properly gauge its size. Mayer said Yahoo has not been able to identify how the 2013 intrusion occurred and that the company did not learn of the incident until the U.S. government presented data to Yahoo in November 2016. She said even “robust” defenses are not enough to defend against state-sponsored attacks and compared the fight with hackers to an “arms race.” Yahoo required users to change passwords and took new steps to make data more secure, Mayer said. “We now know that Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored hackers were responsible for highly complex and sophisticated attacks on Yahoo’s systems,” Mayer said. She said “really aggressive” pursuit of hackers was needed to discourage the efforts, and that even the most well-defended companies “could fall victim to these crimes.” The current and former chief executives of credit bureau Equifax, which disclosed in September that a data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, said they did not know who was responsible for the attack. Senator Bill Nelson said “only stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties will help incentivize companies to properly safeguard consumer information.” Thune told reporters after the hearing the Equifax data breach had created “additional momentum” for Congress to approve legislation. He said Mayer’s testimony was “important in shaping our future reactions.” The Senate Commerce Committee took the unusual step of subpoenaing Mayer to testify on Oct. 25 after a representative for Mayer declined multiple requests for her voluntarily testimony. A representative for Mayer said on Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily. ","

291, ,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"Supported by Sprint and T-Mobile said on Saturday that they had ended merger talks, marking the second time in three years that the two failed to reach a deal to create a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T. The announcement represents a setback to Sprint, T-Mobile and their majority shareholders — Sprint is owned by the Japanese technology giant SoftBank and T-Mobile by Deutsche Telekom of Germany — in their efforts to create a stronger third-place competitor in the American wireless market. But unlike three years ago, when Sprint and T-Mobile called off their last round of merger discussions because of strong opposition from the Barack Obama administration, this time the culprit was control. The final blow to the latest round of talks came Saturday night in Tokyo, when Tim Höttges, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, met at the Tokyo home of SoftBank’s founder, Masayoshi Son, according to a person briefed on the matter. There, Mr. Höttges delivered to Mr. Son and Sprint’s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, new terms for a merger of the American companies. Mr. Son and Mr. Claure ultimately rejected the plan because it did not give SoftBank and Sprint enough control over the combined entity, people briefed on the discussions said. Choosing to abandon the deal talks means that Sprint and T-Mobile must now continue on their own paths to challenging their much bigger and better-financed rivals. For consumers, that probably signals a prolonging of a price war among the four wireless providers — one that analysts have said appears unsustainable for the smaller carriers in the long run. In a joint statement, Sprint and T-Mobile said that they could not come to “mutually agreeable terms” for a combination. “We have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record,” John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, said in the statement. Mr. Claure of Sprint added in the statement, “We have agreed that it is best to move forward on our own.” People briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said that a deal always hinged on SoftBank’s comfort with taking a minority stake in the combined business. Deutsche Telekom was expected to be the biggest shareholder of the merged company, given that T-Mobile is the bigger business by market value. T-Mobile’s market capitalization as of Friday’s close was $48.5 billion, while Sprint’s was $26.7 billion. Though the two had been in on-again, off-again talks for months, they appeared to be making progress, with an eye on striking a deal before Thanksgiving. But at a SoftBank board meeting on Friday, several directors of the Japanese company expressed reservations about giving up control of a major telecom service provider, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. Shares in both companies fell last week after Nikkei Asian Review, a Japanese business publication, reported that SoftBank intended to walk away from the transaction. But Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile planned to make one last offer to SoftBank and Sprint. The stakes for Sprint and T-Mobile are perhaps higher now than they were in the summer of 2014, when the two last pursued a merger. While both have waged a price war against their bigger competitors, drawing new customers in the process, few in the industry believe that the Sprint and T-Mobile can sustain the costs of a drawn-out war against better-capitalized opponents. Walking away from a merger with T-Mobile will provide the biggest test yet of Mr. Son’s ability to turn around Sprint after more than a decade of trouble. The billionaire led SoftBank’s takeover of the troubled American telecom in 2012, paying nearly $22 billion for a majority stake. At the time, Mr. Son argued that he could take on Verizon and AT&T — but those ambitions hinged on ultimately combining his new telecom with T-Mobile. Then, Sprint was seen as the stronger company and in position to own a bigger share of the combined business. Three years later, however, T-Mobile has become the better performer, its brash cost-cutting campaign forced Verizon and AT&T into a tough price war. Sprint has largely lagged behind, though analysts praised its third-quarter financial performance as showing signs of promise. Putting the two companies together would have created a business with more scale — and more financial capability to pay for both network upgrades and discounts for service plans. Sprint, in particular, was seen as bearing a bigger financial burden, carrying $34.2 billion in long-term debt on its books as of Sept. 30, while having posted annual losses for years. T-Mobile, while reporting $27.7 billion in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, has been profitable every year since 2013. Combining the two telecom providers would have helped their majority shareholders as well. SoftBank has faced concerns from investors about how it would manage Sprint’s debt load, while Deutsche Telekom has been concerned about the fate of its best-performing business asset. Among the most prominent advocates of a merger of the two companies was Mr. Son of SoftBank. “Three is a real fight, a real competition,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in September. Both companies had been hoping that, unlike in 2014, a merger of the two would be looked upon more favorably this time around. The Obama administration had strongly hinted that it would fight to oppose a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, arguing that consolidation would hurt consumers. By contrast, the deal makers at both companies said that they believed the Trump administration would let a deal take place. Now, Sprint and T-Mobile will be left on their own to battle Verizon and AT&T — and each other. Executives from both companies appeared ready to wage that fight. “We are determined to continue our efforts to change the wireless industry and compete fiercely,” Mr. Claure said in the joint statement. “We look forward to continuing to take the fight to the duopoly and newly emerging competitors.” And Mr. Legere wrote in a tweet, “We’ve been changing this industry for good for the past 5 years and #WeWontStop!” Advertisement ",Sprint and T-Mobile End Merger Discussions - The New York Times,-0.1707

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said at an investor conference the company could spend more than its previous guidance of $5 billion to $6 billion per year on capital expenditures, and that cash on hand could dip next year as it builds out its network. “We came to the realization that we’re still far away from what the Sprint network can actually deliver,” Claure said on Wednesday. “I don’t think we’ve put all our assets to work.” Sprint and No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile said on Saturday they have called off merger talks to create a combined U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Claure said on Wednesday that the talks fell through because SoftBank Group Corp CEO Masayoshi Son was not prepared to relinquish control of Sprint. SoftBank owns a majority of Sprint shares. “We’re always going to be open to looking at possible alternatives,” he said, adding that “we believe that eventually there’s going to need to be a tie-up between a telco and a cable company.” Sprint shares rose 4.2 percent to $5.99 in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.

The companies announced the agreement a day after Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc ended merger talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Altice, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator, will use Sprint’s network to provide voice and data services in the United States. It gave no time line on when it will introduce such services. The deal will allow Sprint to use Altice’s cable infrastructure to transmit cellular data and develop a next-generation network, or 5G. Sprint and T-Mobile on Saturday called off merger talks to create a bigger U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders. That has left Sprint, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, to engineer a turnaround on its own. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s majority owner, said in a separate announcement on Sunday that it intended to increase its stake in Sprint but that it would keep ownership of outstanding common stock under 85 percent, a move that avoids triggering a tender offer for the remaining shares. SoftBank currently owns roughly 82 percent of Sprint. U.S. cable companies have begun venturing into the wireless market as a way to bundle more services to reduce churn, or customer defections, at a time when more consumers are canceling cable subscriptions. Comcast Corp started selling wireless service this year on Verizon Communications Inc’s network, and Charter Communications Inc plans to launch service next year. ","

Rumors are spreading that the merger being negotiated by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) is hitting a rough patch right now, months after the companies first started talking, and just as the two were expected to expected to seal the deal. According to reports, Sprint majority stakeholder SoftBank Group, and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom AG can't agree on how much control each would receive in the deal; CNBC is reporting Deutsche Telecom's management may visit SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son this weekend to smooth things over. You may remember that Sprint and T-Mobile considered a deal back in 2014 that would have resulted in Sprint buying out T-Mobile, but those talks ended when the prospect of a merger met with strong resistance from regulators. If the Sprint and T-Mobile deal falls apart for good this time, it's unlikely the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers will try a third time. As Sprint and T-Mobile try to keep their merger talks alive, let's take a quick look at two possible alternatives for Sprint if the deal doesn't work out. Image source: Getty Images. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could be a strong contender to make a bid for Sprint, mainly because the cable company just jumped into the mobile wireless business earlier this year. Comcast only offers wireless services to its Xfinity Internet subscribers, and buying Sprint would significantly expand the cable company's reach. And even if Comcast doesn't want to become the nation's fourth-largest wireless carrier, the cable company could always purchase some of Sprint's spectrum, and sell it off later. Comcast made a similar move several years ago when it bought up wireless spectrum and later sold it to Verizon. What we do know is that Comcast is looking for new areas of growth as pay-TV subscriber numbers continue to decline. Research from Kagan estimates that by 2021, traditional TV providers will have lost 11 million subscribers nationwide. One hang-up for a potential Comcast deal is that it would need to be approved by Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). Like Comcast, Charter announced plans for a mobile wireless service for its customers, and the two have teamed up, in a sense, to ensure they can test the mobile waters without competition from each other. To that end, they agreed that neither would make any wireless acquisitions without the other's consent. This could also open up another opportunity for Sprint, where both Charter and Comcast buy some of Sprint, and the mobile carrier uses the cash to continue building out its business. Charter and Comcast had pursued a similar scenario over the summer, but it never materialized as Sprint opted to pursue a deal with T-Mobile. It's also possible that Sprint could get snatched up by DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH). DISH been aggressively buying up swaths of wireless spectrum -- it purchased $6.2 billion worth in the latest wireless auction alone. So there's been lots of talk about DISH either buying or being bought by a wireless provider, and a collapse of the Sprint/T-Mobile deal would only fuel further speculation. DISH is expected to launch an Internet of Things network -- for bringing small, data-sipping devices online -- in the next few years, but a deal with Sprint would instantly make DISH a key player in the mobile market, and give it even greater opportunities to utilize its wireless spectrum. Though it looks like T-Mobile and Sprint are trying to salvage their deal, anything could happen at this point. What's clear, though, is that Sprint is very interested in being bought. The carrier has worked hard to improve its business recently -- Sprint posted its highest operating income in 10 years in its latest quarter -- but the company's position in the U.S. wireless market isn't nearly as strong as it used to be. Sprint isn't likely to give up on the idea of being acquired if its deal with T-Mobile were to fall apart -- again. ","
      
    The T-Mobile and Sprint Merger Isn't a Done Deal: Who Buys Sprint If It Falls Apart? -- The Motley Fool

These days, it's hard to find a stock more beaten down than Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). The regional telecom's shares have been absolutely hammered over the past few years -- to the point where they're touching the lowest they've been in over three decades. That's quite a dive. Let's take a closer look to determine if Frontier might be able to pick itself up from the floor and get its stock moving higher again. Frontier stock's latest major price swoon began in early 2015, very shortly after the company agreed to pay over $10.5 billion to acquire a big set of Verizon Communication (NYSE:VZ) assets in Florida, California, and Texas. That was the second monster deal between the two companies; in 2009, Frontier parted with $8.6 billion to buy similar assets in 14 states. Image source: Getty Images. When the 2015 deal closed last year, Frontier took over approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband accounts, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers formerly owned by Verizon. At a stroke, Frontier doubled its size, and then some. The company placed this massive bet because, in the words of CEO Daniel McCarthy, ""[i]t significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" The problem was that this flew in the face of two major trends: cord-cutting and what we can call broadband migration. The former is the well-known practice of ditching traditional pay-TV providers like FiOS for a smorgasbord of streaming services. The latter, which is related to cord-cutting, refers to customers moving to cable internet from the DSL technology delivered over phone lines. This isn't only a Frontier problem; it's been prevalent throughout the telecom industry. Yet the company was particularly vulnerable to it because of its size and scope -- it's much smaller, as you can see below, than top peers Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). Compounding that, unlike those giants, Frontier doesn't have other significant business units (like AT&T's DirecTV) that it can mobilize to help make up for the declining revenue. FTR Market Cap data by YCharts. Since the latest Verizon deal closed, the purchased customer base in Florida, California, and Texas has eroded in every quarter. And for more than a year, the company's revenue has dropped from quarter to quarter, with the bottom line landing consistently in the red. A deep (62%) dividend cut earlier this year shored up the finances somewhat; unfortunately, it also gave investors a solid reason to abandon or avoid the shares. A subsequent reverse stock split saved the company from an embarrassing delisting but ultimately couldn't halt the share price slide. It's been quite a tumble. From the start of this year alone, Frontier's stock has plummeted by almost 83%. It's hard to see how Frontier can crawl its way out of this. It invested heavily in technology its customers don't seem to want much these days, and there's no backup revenue source. The dividend, even at the drastically reduced rate, yields an insane 27%. That's not a sign of financial strength, nor does it indicate a deep bargain find -- it's a flashing red light for a company that's in deep trouble. I can't imagine any scenario in which Frontier stock rebounds from even this drastically reduced level. I very much doubt this will be a recovery story. ","

298,Daniel B. Kline,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In 2014, regulatory opposition forced Sprint (NYSE:S) to give up on its plan to acquire T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Three years later, the two companies returned to the negotiating table, coming close to finalizing an agreement before the deal hit roadblocks once again. What happened? And what lies ahead for the No. 3 and 4 wireless providers? A full transcript follows the video. Dan Kline: Nice to be here! Shen: Are you in town this time for any special occasion? Kline: I was speaking to potential college journalists -- well, I guess, they're actual college journalists who want to be professional journalists. I got to give them the scary ""our profession is not as good as it was,"" but there are wonderful places like Motley Fool where, if you can make your way here eventually, it'll be good for you. It was actually organized by a former Fool, as well. Shen: There you go. Today, Fools, for our main subject of discussion, we're branching out into the telecommunications industry for this episode. You'll have a chance, Dan, to share some of your coverage there. It's been a while since we've talked about this space, but I understand that T-Mobile and Sprint have been making headlines in the past several months, this whole ordeal. Those companies are the No. 3 and No. 4 names, respectively, among U.S. wireless providers. Before we dive into the recent news around their potential merger and how that's fallen through, I want to talk about some of the background for the two companies, and I think that will help once we get into the nitty gritty of the recent news, in terms of understanding some of their motivations and the various incentives that are at play here. Let's start with T-Mobile. The company, I think, is probably best known for two things -- its CEO, John Legere, and also its Un-carrier branding, which I think has been very successful for the company. Kline: And it's not just branding. When John Legere took over, and he's a very bombastic guy, I always likened him to a 1980s pro-wrestling manager. He's very in your face, he'll taunt you, he'll call out his opposition, he has nicknames. Sort of a fun version of what the president likes to do. So what they did with Un-carrier is, he looked at every consumer pain point in the mobile process. So the first big one was contracts. You'd be tied into this two-year contract, you would have a device subsidy, you wouldn't know what you were really paying for anything. They got rid of that. The more recent ones are having only unlimited data. Yes, I know there's caveats, they slow you down after 22 gigs, but that's 2% of the audience. For most people, completely unlimited data. And every few months, they come out with something new, and it's silly stuff. T-Mobile Tuesday is just like, this Tuesday I get a free Frosty at Wendy's. But last month, they came out with, ""We're giving all of our customers Netflix."" So they're really trying to find a way to be different, to be a customer first mobile company. And it's worked. T-Mobile has added over a million subscribers for 18 straight quarters. And as John Legere likes to say, they've had all the growth in the wireless space. Shen: Legere started his role at T-Mobile in late 2012. They rolled out the first Un-carrier Initiative 1.0, they called it at the time, not much later, I believe it was March of 2013. So in that time, as you mentioned, the company has seen some pretty strong results. I think customers and listeners will realize that a lot of the things that they enjoy now, maybe even take for granted when they look through their wireless bill, was often a byproduct of the competition coming from these various Un-carrier moves. Kline: T-Mobile has forced AT&T and Verizon, and to a lesser extent Sprint, because Sprint wasn't quite as evil as AT&T and Verizon were acting in some of their no-longer practices, but the big one was overages. It's hard to quantify how much we were paying in overages, because they function in two ways. There's the actual, ""I go over my data allotment and have to pay."" That was billions of dollars. But Legere would always talk about the person who bought a too-big plan, because they didn't want to worry about it, and that was perhaps tens of billions of dollars that was getting sucked out of consumers' pockets. So by being transparent and saying, ""We're not going to do those kind of things"" -- T-Mobile was No. 4 and sinking, and since 2013, now they're No. 3 and rising. And they've been picking up momentum pretty much every quarter. The challenge is, as Verizon, AT&T, everybody's prices have come down, everybody offers unlimited, Sprint is really cheap, the challenge is, how do you keep doing that when maybe a lot of those pain points are gone? Shen: Yeah. At the end of 2013, which was, again, the year the Un-carrier program started, T-Mobile had 46 million customers, they had a churn of about 1.7% per month. Now, as of the most recently reported quarter, that's Q3 for 2017, reported just October 23, they have 71 million customers, great growth there. Their churn is down to 1.2%, seeing very consistent progress with that core metric for this industry. Some other notable highlights, from that approximately four-year period, to note, under the leadership of Legere, they moved, as you said, from the No. 4 to the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier. Of course, that gap -- Kline: It's a huge gap. Shen: -- is a massive one. So it's really AT&T against Verizon at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, and then T-Mobile and Sprint at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively. They've had 18 straight quarters of more than one million net customer additions, which I think you mentioned, Dan. They've had compound annual top line growth of almost 14% for that period, improving profitability. T-Mobile shares have gained over 200%, so stockholders are pretty happy with the Un-carrier. Let's turn our attention now to Sprint. What have been the big themes or drivers for this company in recent memory? Because they're not doing nearly as well. Kline: Sprint is doing better, but Sprint was a sinking ship. It was losing ground as T-Mobile was gaining ground, because it had no identity. It was just the carrier that's a little cheaper than AT&T and Verizon, but not quite as cheap as T-Mobile. Marcelo Claure, their CEO, who is willing to go toe-to-toe with John Legere, he sort of righted the ship, but the way he's done it is heavy discounting. So Sprint is almost always, at some point, the best deal. And when I say some point, I mean, maybe it's families this week, maybe it's individuals next week. They're not always the lowest across the board for every type of plan you would want. But they generally have some crazy deal that would be good for somebody. They do things like two iPhones for one. So they've returned to slight growth in terms of subscribers, but it's not necessarily sustainable, because a lot of their promotions sunset. So March 2018, you no longer pay $30 a month, now you pay $55. And it's so easy to move now, which makes the T-Mobile churn number even more impressive. It's no longer the days where moving was a big challenge and it was hard to get your number. Now, it's very easy. You could switch cellphone providers every three months if you wanted to, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. So Sprint is on better ground, but they haven't spent a lot of money on their network, which is a problem. They will argue that they're within 1% of the other networks, and that's not really what the data shows. Shen: In terms of the coverage and the network quality. Kline: Yeah. And the reality is, they're the No. 4 network, generally, on most of the accepted standards. There's all sorts of different data and different ways you can parse things, but it's pretty widely accepted that Sprint is the worst, and it's going to get worse as they don't spend money, which is part of why they might like to be for sale. Shen: And as of the most recent quarterly report, Sprint has added postpaid subscribers for nine straight quarters. They did see their highest postpaid additions in company history. So some positive marks, as you mentioned. They also cut a ton of costs year to date. I believe it's yielded savings of $750 million. Kline: It's price, as well, with postpaid. Boost Mobile tends to be the cheapest. So they might be cannibalizing their own customer base, because you can port your Sprint phone to a Boost Mobile phone with zero effort and pay less. Shen: The cost-cutting efforts are definitely a focus for management right now. They're improving their profitability, but at this point, that company has still reported negative earnings for several years running. And on the not so bright side, the stock is down about 30% year-to-date, and quite a bit today, last I checked before we came into the studio, because the negotiations for this T-Mobile-Sprint deal are officially over. The press release from both companies came out on Saturday. The stock in general has been seesawing between $3 to $10 per share, essentially, for the past five years. I feel like the cost-cutting and the slowly improving business, or the gradual turnaround that Claure is working on here, it's one part of the puzzle. As you mentioned earlier, the company needs to generate so much cash -- any company in this industry needs to generate so much cash each year to reinvest in the wireless network, to not only just match your competitors in terms of what service you offer, but then you have, for example, 5G networks on the horizon, people already starting to test the infrastructure for that. Kline: Buying spectrum. Shen: And that's just another demand in terms of resources that you have to satisfy. Kline: If you look at what Sprint is doing, they're cleaning up the asset for a sale, a merger, a partnership, whatever it ends up being. We'll talk about that later. But you're not going to make a deal with something that's bleeding customers, that's losing billions of dollars. So if you can take the loss to pretty much zero, and it was a relatively minor loss in the last quarter, and be putting the subscriber needle in the right direction, you're at least showing, whether it's a partner or a buyer or however it comes down, ""Hey, there's a bottom here. We're not going to go to zero."" And there was a while where it looked like every Sprint customer was just going to become a T-Mobile customer. Shen: We'll take a closer look at the deal negotiations between the two companies and how that panned out. We'll talk about that next. So now you have some high-level perspective of these two companies, where they are and where they've been the past couple of years. So we can talk about the deal that just wasn't meant to be. It's the second time now, right? So on Saturday, November 4, Sprint and T-Mobile pushed out the press releases announcing the end of their merger negotiations. Dan, I feel like on this show, we've talked several times about these long, drawn-out ordeals. We've talked about Viacom, their leadership battle, we've talked about the Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's merger being this long, drawn-out saga. And now, we have this last one here. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how things progressed in the last few months, how they started up and how they ended? Kline: There are logical reasons for these companies to get together. You put their subscriber bases together, and it's about equal to either AT&T or Verizon. So it gives them scale. You can lay off a lot of customer service people, a lot of accountants. Shen: Redundant functions, yeah. Kline: You don't need two networks. There were also some major drawbacks. I didn't want this deal to happen, because I remember when Sprint bought Nextel, when Nextel was essentially No. 5 in the wireless space. Nextel used a different technology than Sprint. As Sprint and T-Mobile are not on the same network technologies. Your Sprint phone can not become a T-Mobile phone. That was the case with the Nextel phone and the Sprint phone. So you're buying something that's not super easy to integrate. It's not like they can just become Spree Mobile, and all of the sudden it's just one company. [laughs] I got one up on you there, we were talking about how this would be named before the show. Shen: Spree Mobile is pretty good. I was going to go with T-Sprint, but I like this more. Kline: There were a lot of operational challenges, but the reality on this is, the best deals are when one company wants out. The Cabela's management knew they weren't coming along with the deal. They were all going to cash out, make some money, go fishing or hunting or whatever it is Cabela's management would do. In this case, SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF), which is the parent company of Sprint, wanted to maintain certain rights and control. They were going to give up the CEO post, John Legere would have that, but they still wanted more management than what they were bringing to the table in terms of valuation offered. That becomes a very dicey deal to make. Shen: To be clear, in terms of the parties that have an interest in these deal negotiations, on one side, with T-Mobile, their majority interest stake is held by Deutsche Telekom, about a 65% ownership stake, I believe. And on the opposite side of the negotiation table, you have Sprint, which is over 80% owned by SoftBank and the billionaire Masayoshi Son. He's been a big part of the direction, the vision for Sprint, these various efforts. He actually tried to have Sprint take over T-Mobile back in 2014 -- Kline: When it might have made sense for Sprint. They were still No. 3, they were the bigger company. Shen: And that deal fell through, because the indication, I believe, that they received from the regulatory body that would overlook and scrutinize the deal was, ""This is not going to happen."" Kline: They flat out said, ""We will not accept any deal that takes the U.S. market from four providers to three providers."" Shen: In this case, we have a new administration now, obviously, and I believe that both parties thought they had a situation where regulators might be more friendly to a deal of this nature. Whether that's the case, again, you're going from four to three major players -- Kline: I think the argument they were going to make is that Comcast and Charter are all somewhat in this, or going into this space, with their own wifi-based MVNO networks, which are networks that don't own their spectrum, they lease it from one of the remaining companies. Shen: Essentially piggybacking off of the companies that have actually developed the infrastructure. Kline: Yeah. And I think they were going to give caveats that they would license their spectrum to X amount of payers. They were going to argue that there were legitimately more choices for Americans than the three or four or whatever you want to call it. I don't know that that would have flown. But I do think the reality is, there were a lot of reasons this deal shouldn't happen, and once it wasn't quick, I think you knew it wasn't going to happen. Shen: Then, you mentioned this too, in terms of what the combined entity would look like, 130 million customers, pretty much on par with AT&T and Verizon. They'd have about $75 billion in annual revenue. Definitely a much more formidable player. Kline: The cost savings would be extraordinary. Shen: But the integrations, as you said, would not nearly be that simple or that seamless. And if you're a customer with either Sprint or T-Mobile and this deal had come together, it wouldn't have been so quick for you to see improvements in your service, and that just comes from the challenge of combining two huge national networks, but they're on different LTE technology. Kline: Because there are no contracts anymore, I think there's a very big risk, and I think we saw this with Frontier Communications, which spent $11 billion buying customers from Verizon, and when it didn't very quickly work well, they didn't get billed right, their service didn't work, their internet wasn't good, whatever it was, they just went, ""Oh, I'm going to go to Comcast."" It's easier to switch your wireless phone than it is to switch your cable service. No one has to come to your house. You can just walk into a Sprint store and they'll give you a bag to mail it back to T-Mobile. It's very simple. So you could have spent, whatever it is in terms of stock, billions and billions of dollars, to take Sprint's 50 million customers, it's a little bit more than that, but the 71 million at T-Mobile, and you could lose 10% in the first three months. And I think that's what would have happened. Everybody's prices are too close together. You would also have to deal with, the pricing structures are different at Sprint and T-Mobile. Are they all going to go to one? Are they going to stay two separate brands? That doesn't make sense from a pricing perspective. So to me, it always made more sense for either of these brands to partner with a cable company or someone else in an adjacent space. Shen: And we can get to that idea. You have these two companies, they tried coming together in 2014. At the time, Sprint was the larger player, in more of the power position. Now, the tables have turned, and T-Mobile has more of the leverage. When it comes down to it, SoftBank, what they had in mind for a deal like this, they didn't want to give up too much control of the future of Spree Mobile, as you called it. Kline: It's also the assets. Masayoshi Son has been spending hundreds of billions of dollars, I forget the exact amount in his tech fund, but it's at least $100 billion. And all of the spectrum assets that Sprint owns, he doesn't want to give up control over, because maybe he'll use it to launch a national over the top cable service. I mean, I'm just making that up, but he wants to be able to pick the company clean for parts. It's not necessarily about the wireless subscribers or that business. I think he was perfectly happy to let John Legere decide what the commercials and the pricing were going to be. It's all the future integration of, does T-Mint or Spree Mobile or whatever we're going to call them, do they merge with Comcast? I think those are the things he wasn't willing to let go. And I think John Legere has earned the right to say, ""I don't want to have a boss anymore."" And that was going to be a sticking point. Shen: So differences in terms of what the controlling stake would look like, the ownership between the two companies and their shareholders and this combined entity. And then, also coming down to valuation as well, Sprint's stock took quite a hit in September. I think it went down about 20%. And then, depending on the timing of the deal, it could be that Sprint shareholders didn't see any kind of premium in the merger. Kline: It's all speculation, because they haven't talked about this, but there have been a lot of reports saying they weren't offering a premium, and it was about efficiency and unlocking value. That's a tough one to sell. But Sprint didn't help itself by, before this negotiation started, they had an exclusive negotiating period with Charter and Comcast about a partnership, a merger. They never exactly announced what it was. But it became pretty clear that there weren't two suitors. So T-Mobile did not have to say, ""We'll pay you 40% more,"" because otherwise, you're going to turn around and, I don't know, McDonald's is going to buy you and use it for mobile ordering. And we'll talk about this soon, there could be somebody out there, but the reason prices drive up in these kinds of deals is, ""If you don't buy us, Amazon will."" And Sprint is a complicated asset. Shen: Some other suitor, sure. So let's wrap up our discussion. The deal is no longer happening, off the table as far as we know. These two companies are going to continue to make their investments, operate independently. Let's look at Sprint first. What do you think lies ahead that investors and listeners should be following for this company? Kline: Well, it won't be McDonald's. [laughs] And, Sprintpotle is also not on the table. Sprint, in my opinion, is going to be sold to a cable company. I think it makes a lot of sense if you're already in the subscription business, you already have that infrastructure for this to be another bundle. I don't think Comcast actually wants to offer a leased service, mostly on wifi, vaguely not that good, nobody wants its phone service. Shen: Which they recently had with Xfinity Mobile. Kline: Yeah. And did it, and Altice has now just signed a deal this week to do it using Sprint's lines. I think they're going to want to have a service they can sell nationally. And it may not be a merger, it may be some sort of exclusive partnership with an investment to take some of the pressure off. But they also have all of the spectrum assets, some of which are saleable if they don't need them. So I think that's going to make the most sense, and you just have to see how that industry is going to shake out. Are Charter and Comcast going to merge? Shen: Do you see it as, Sprint is grooming itself for another suitor to come in? Kline: Yeah, I think Sprint has to continue to show -- even if they can eke out a profit, it's a lot easier to buy something that's revenue-neutral than buy something that's revenue-negative. If you're going to sell this to Charter shareholders or Comcast shareholders or whoever it is, I think Sprint could do more to cut costs. They could be more of a position to integrate quickly. And that's probably going to mean a lot of discounting, good for consumers, and a lot of barebones staffing, not so good for consumers. Shen: Let's look at T-Mobile, then. They're still doing incredibly well, claiming a lot of the growth that this industry is seeing overall, no longer combining with Sprint. What are the big next steps for them? Keep going with the Un-carrier initiatives? It seems to be getting harder and harder for them to set themselves apart with that. Kline: Deutsche Telekom would probably rather not have to keep investing. It's spent like $40 billion in the last six years, or something like that. Shen: In terms of the network for T-Mobile. Kline: In terms of the network and building out capacity. And that's not going to change with 5G and all the other things. So, I think they're open to a deal. I think there's also the possibility that someone like an Altice, a company that's European-based or one of the companies in other parts of the world, that there might be some synergy in either merging with T-Mobile or joint operating, and having a more global company. Again, standards and technology become a challenge there. But I think T-Mobile is in a position where they can sit back, and as long as John Legere doesn't retire, they're in a very good position to just wait for the best deal, see if Amazon or Apple wants to buy them. Shen: OK. So for both instances, you see some form of consolidation or M&A deal being potential things to watch. Kline: I don't think it has to be -- Shen: Because, my take was more so for Sprint, for sure. Kline: The Sprint original deal they talked about was Comcast and Charter was an investment plus, essentially, becoming their wireless company. I think that type of deal is actually more logical for T-Mobile, for a healthy company to say, ""Now we're going to offer service in Mexico through Wal-Mart,"" those types of deals, I think, make more sense with a healthy company than they do with an ailing company. But there is so much negative to owning Sprint that there might be big players like Comcast more willing to have it be an investment in a partnership, rather than an outright purchase. Shen: Alright. That wraps up our discussion for this deal. We'll continue to track the progress for Sprint's turnaround, for how T-Mobile decides to proceed with their next Un-carrier initiative, for example, as these two companies make those announcements in due time.

    The Sprint and T-Mobile Merger Falls Apart for a Second Time -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9998
299,Adam Levy,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), and AT&T (NYSE:T) are three of the big names in the U.S. wireless industry. In recent years, Sprint has been putting pressure on the economics of the two giants -- Verizon and AT&T -- in the form of aggressive pricing and other competitive moves like early adoption of equipment installment plans and smartphone leases. What's more, while AT&T and Verizon are investing in areas outside of their core wireless businesses, Sprint is focused exclusively on wireless. Investors may be wondering whether Sprint makes a better buy than a stalwart like AT&T or Verizon. Or if Verizon and AT&T are better positioned, which of them is best among the three wireless carriers. Let's examine each one a bit more closely to determine which stock is the best buy. Image source: Verizon. Sprint is a big fan of pointing out that the gap between its network coverage and Verizon's has gotten much narrower in recent years. That said, Verizon still consistently earns the highest grades in third-party network quality tests. But even its strong network hasn't stopped it from feeling pricing pressure. It saw 11 straight quarters of declining service revenue before things started turning around last quarter. It was practically forced to start offering an unlimited data plan. Then it quickly moved to offering two tiers of unlimited data to help control its cost of services and compete on price. All of its efforts have paid off. In the first two full quarters since introducing its unlimited plan, Verizon has added over 200,000 postpaid phone subscribers after several quarters of disappointing net additions (and losses). Service revenue is starting to turn around, as management forecast, and subscriber churn levels remain the lowest in the industry. Verizon has taken steps to expand beyond wireless with its digital media business, Oath. It also has a wireline business providing internet, video, and landline service. Still, it hasn't resorted to measures as drastic as AT&T, which has made big acquisitions in the form of DirecTV and Time Warner in recent years. It's still strapped with a boatload of debt from its buyout of a minority stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014. Image source: Sprint. With a wireless network that consistently ranks at the bottom of third-party measurement surveys, Sprint has resorted to aggressive pricing to win over customers. This summer, for example, it started offering free service to new customers, particularly targeting Verizon subscribers. For its efforts, Sprint has started to see new customers come on board. The company's share of gross subscriber additions reached an all-time high last quarter, according to management. Its 367,000 net postpaid phone subscriber additions still fall short of Verizon's, though. What's more, unlike Verizon or AT&T, Sprint is losing postpaid connected device subscribers. Sprint's aggressive pricing is also putting pressure on its service revenue. Through the first half of fiscal 2018, postpaid service revenue is down 7%. That's worse than Verizon, which has notably struggled to sustain its service revenue. Image source: AT&T. AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV and its pending acquisition of Time Warner have put it in a position to offer an aggressively priced entertainment bundle with its wireless service. Unlimited plan subscribers get free HBO and $25 off one of AT&T's video services. The plan hasn't stopped it from losing postpaid phone subscribers, which declined another 97,000 last quarter. Overall, service revenue fell 2.8% year over year last quarter, and average revenue per postpaid subscriber fell 3.5%. Meanwhile, AT&T is bleeding video subscribers as well. The company lost 89,000 video subscribers, with nearly 300,000 U-Verse and DirecTV subscribers replaced by DirecTV Now subscribers -- AT&T's streaming video service. That said, AT&T's been able to continue raising prices for its linear TV services to maintain slight revenue growth. Sprint doesn't have a competitive advantage beyond lower pricing. If the company continues to rely on undercutting AT&T and Verizon to win customers, it will be difficult for it to generate enough cashflow to build out its network and provide a more competitive service. It's currently about break-even on a free-cash-flow basis. Comparatively, Verizon and AT&T are cash-flow giants. Verizon generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and AT&T produced $16.5 billion. Verizon's free cash flow was negatively impacted by a $3.2 billion tax bill on the sale of some of its wireline assets and the decision to shift to an asset-backed bond to pull forward revenue from its equipment installment plans. Adjusting for those factors, Verizon's cash flow is comparable to AT&T's. The free cash flows of Verizon and AT&T support big dividend yields of 4.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Perhaps the best valuation metric for comparing the wireless carriers is EV to EBITDA. Here's how the three stack up. Company EV to EBITDA Multiple Verizon 6.9 AT&T 6.5 Sprint 5.5 Table source: Yahoo! Finance. Investors should note that Sprint's EBITDA is comparably higher due to the fact that it uses device leasing. Instead of expensing devices, Sprint capitalizes them and then amortizes them over time. This results in a higher EBITDA than if devices showed up in cost of goods sold, like they do with Verizon and AT&T. As such, Sprint's lower EV-to-EBITDA multiple isn't very impressive. Verizon is actually growing its subscriber base and isn't bogged down with a declining pay-TV business. As such, it deserves a slight premium to AT&T. On the other hand, AT&T offers a higher dividend yield, supported by massive free cash flow. For investors looking for more exposure to the U.S. wireless industry, Verizon is the best buy. If you're comfortable with lots of exposure to the declining pay-TV market, AT&T presents better value. I'd stay away from Sprint, though. ","

Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) reported solid third-quarter 2017 results after the market closed on Wednesday. Shares have returned 31.9% in 2017 through Wednesday, versus the S&P 500's 17.1%. Here's how the quarter worked out for the data center operator and global interconnection specialist that's organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Metric Q3 2017 Q3 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue Operating income $224.9 million $170.0 million Net income $79.9 million $51.5 million 55% Earnings per share (EPS) $1.02 $0.72 Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)* $391.3 million $284.2 million AFFO per share $4.97 $3.95 Data source: Equinix. *AFFO is a closely watched metric for companies organized as REITs, as it's a driver of payouts to shareholders. It's akin to ""earnings"" for REITs. Reported revenue got a boost from foreign exchange and includes $137 million of revenue from the acquisition of 29 Verizon data centers, which was completed last quarter. On a normalized and constant currency basis, revenue increased 10% year over year -- still quite solid -- and 8% from the previous quarter. Equinix's revenue came in above its guidance range of $1,133 million to $1,141 million. The company doesn't provide a quarterly AFFO outlook. Image source: Getty Images. Here's what CEO Steve Smith had to say in the press release about the quarter: Equinix had a strong third quarter as customers continue to adopt interconnection oriented architectures as the preferred platform for their shift to digital. Robust demand is driving higher utilization levels, and we are investing in support of this momentum with expansions, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, to deliver even greater value to customers through our global platform. As customers embrace hybrid and multicloud as the IT architecture of choice, our interconnection strength is resonating, and Equinix continues to outpace market growth and gain market share. Equinix increased its full-year 2017 guidance. The company said the $37 million (at midpoint) guidance raise is due to better-than-expected operating performance of $8 million in the third quarter, additional foreign currency benefit of $16 million when compared to the prior guidance, and $13 million in revenue from two acquisitions it made early in the fourth quarter.

Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW) is enjoying a very good year. While its stock price is up nearly 30% year to date, nearly doubling the S&P 500's return, its impressive run looks to continue for some time yet, judging by its recently reported third-quarter results. While its core sales and core EPS growth were modest on the surface, at 6% and 2%, respectively, closer inspection reveals a lot for Corning shareholders to be excited about. The market seemed to like the quarter, too, as the company's stock price jumped more than 6% the day it reported. We don't have to look far to see why investors were so impressed. Corning's optical communications division -- which manufactures optical fiber and provides connectivity solutions for some of the world's largest telecom networks and cable providers -- showed strong year-over-year core earnings growth of 13% and this division is Corning's second-largest income-earning division. (""Core"" numbers are management's favored adjusted financial metrics that it believes best express how the company is performing. For instance, it excludes the impact that foreign exchange rates had on the quarter's numbers.) Better yet, management stated that the earnings for this division would have been even higher if it hadn't been reinvesting so much back into the business to increase manufacturing capacity. While Corning's specialty materials division, the home of Gorilla Glass, saw even stronger sales and earnings growth, its optical communications business segment is where Corning might be building a nearly unbreachable moat against competitors. Corning is now the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber and offers a number of award-winning innovations in the market. Image source: Corning Inc. In the company's recent quarterly press release, it announced that it had now produced 1 billion kilometers of optical fiber. That's a whole lot! In fact, according to the company, that's ""one-third of the optical fiber ever produced in the history of the world."" This accomplishment comes on the heels of a major deal with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) whereby the telecom carrier announced that it will buy more than $1.05 billion of optical fiber over the next three years from Corning. In the company's conference call, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks talked not only about why even better things are still ahead. According to the transcript from S&P Global Market Intelligence, he said: Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind, anywhere in the world. ... We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate and to increase our market access. ... These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry ... We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020. That Corning is the lowest-cost producer of optical fiber gives it an impressive economic moat against its competitors. Beyond that, the company also offers a variety of innovative solutions. For instance, the company's EDGE8 solution is a preterminated optical cabling system designed specifically for data centers. EDGE8 allows data center operators to maximize their assets without the need for conversion modules, leading to lower costs. It also provides a straightforward path for data centers to upgrade to 40G, 100G, or 400G ethernet. Corning showed strength in its optical communication division in its recently reported third quarter. Data source: Corning Inc. 2017 Q3 2017 earnings. Some might counter that while Corning's optical communications segment's results were impressive, the company still only managed to increase earnings by 2% companywide. However, this argument misses the larger point: Corning has transformed itself from a cyclical industrial company dependent on commodity pricing to an enterprise with incredible technical prowess and proprietary know-how in diverse areas. The company's largest income-generating division, display technologies, accounted for 52% of the company's core earnings this quarter. This business segment largely manufactures specialized glass substrates used as a key component in liquid crystal displays for devices such as smartphones, computer monitors, and large-screen televisions. Earnings in this business segment are notoriously cyclical and are often based on glass prices, a factor far outside Corning's control. This quarter, core earnings in this department fell 16% year over year. In years past, that would have tanked Corning's quarter. While display technologies still comprises slightly more than half of Corning's earnings, it's not nearly as big, percentage-wise, as it was previously. That core earnings in this division could have fallen by so much while the company still eked out a small core earnings gain shows just how far Corning has come in increasing its other streams of revenue. For shareholders, there's a lot to like not only about Corning's latest quarter, but its incredible transformation as a company. Not the least of things to like is Corning's growing moat in optical fiber manufacturing. With innovative solutions and lowest-cost production capabilities, Corning expects to continue to grow this division at twice the rate of the telecommunications industry and is projecting at least $5 billion in sales in this segment by 2020. Optical communications had about $3 billion in net sales in 2016.  Corning is setting itself up for long-term success. ","

Retirees count on safe, dividend-paying stocks for regular income and to protect their wealth. Though they may not necessarily be the most exciting stocks on the market, these types of investments are just what people in their golden years need to avoid risk and reap the rewards of their portfolios. While the market's high valuation has made it harder to find high dividend yields, there are still some good opportunities in the market. Below, three of our analysts discuss their picks for high-yield safe stocks, including National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Danny Vena (National Retail Properties): A real estate investment trust (REIT) can be a great addition to a retirement portfolio. These investment vehicles receive special tax treatment, avoiding typical corporate taxes, and in return are required to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. As a result, REITs typically produce higher yields than many other dividend stocks. National Retail Properties invests in single-tenant net leased retail properties, which requires its tenants to pay for the operating expenses of their locations, including taxes, maintenance, and insurance. With fewer expenses, the company has more profits to return to shareholders. What makes National Retail Properties even more compelling is the composition of its portfolio. You might be concerned about the trend away from brick-and-mortar retail, as more and more shoppers make purchases online. This company avoids shopping centers and strip malls, and its tenants typically offer services that can't be duplicated online, like restaurants, convenience stores, automotive service centers, and fitness centers. National Retail Properties has initial lease terms of between 15 and 20 years, with contractual rent increases built into each lease. This provides reliable growth for its portfolio, which consists of 2,675 properties, with over 400 tenants in 48 states. Its strategy results in higher renewal rates and consistently high occupancy rates, currently at 99.3%. Over the last 25 years the company has produced an average total return of 13.5%. National Retail Properties has increased its dividend in each of the last 28 consecutive years, and is currently yielding 4.5%. Daniel Miller (Iron Mountain): Ironically, retirees looking for a safe investment won't need to look much further than a company built to protect information. Iron Mountain, which received IRS approval to operate as a REIT in 2014, is a global leader in record storage. In fact, it provides its services to roughly 94% of Fortune 1,000 companies, and has more than 1,400 facilities dedicated to storing information for record-intensive industries -- think healthcare, law, and finance-type industries. While Iron Mountain might be a new name to many investors, it's a trusted name in data management and offers consumers a compelling option to reduce the costs and risks of storing and protecting information assets. It's a safe investment due in part to its high retention of customers, low turnover and low maintenance capital expenditures. Going forward, management plans to grow the business by expanding into emerging markets as they begin requiring more data management, as well as adjacent businesses such as art storage. There will always be global demand for secure data management options, and what's even better for retirees looking for stable income is that REITs are required by law to maintain dividend payout ratios of at least 90%. Currently Iron Mountain's dividend yield sits at 5.8%, making it a great option for investors seeking income. Jeremy Bowman (Verizon Communications): There may be no safer sector than telecom, a highly regulated oligopoly with a captive market, and no telecom company is more dominant than Verizon.  The nation's biggest wireless provider offers investors a defensive stock with a 4.8% dividend yield and a low P/E of just 12.3. As a provider of necessary services like phone and data, Verizon will fare considerably better than the broad market in a recession, and the company has plenty of room to raise its dividend as its payout ratio is a reasonable 59%. The company has also increased its dividends for 11 years in a row. While Verizon has struggled to grow earnings in a competitive market, the company continues to add subscribers, with 603,000 additions in the most recent quarter, and is seeing growth in Fios and its new media business Oath, which came from the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo. As consolidation continues in the telecom and media industries Verizion should benefit, and could add other assets to its media business. The proliferation of wearables like smartwatches should also help grow revenue over the coming years. With a leading position in its industry, a defensive business model, and a strong and growing dividend, Verizon is great choice for retirees in search of safety. ","

303,Selena Maranjian,11092017,Fool,11022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Retirement is when most people are assumed to be living on a ""fixed income."" Well, yes, Social Security checks can remain fixed for a few years, though they do rise over time to keep up with inflation. Some other income sources, such as bonds, might also offer fixed income. Fortunately, though, there are plenty of ways that you can increase your retirement income, to make it less fixed. You can even employ a Social Security strategy or two to make your future checks bigger. Image source: Getty Images. Here are eight ways to increase your retirement income. This is probably not the kind of tip you wanted to see, but it's a powerful one. If you can work a few more years than you originally planned to, there are multiple benefits: Your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it -- and it will have to support you for fewer years. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). The table below shows what a difference an extra year or two can make in your investing -- if you're socking away $10,000 annually and it's growing by an annual average of 8%: Growing at 8% For: $10,000 Invested Annually 15 years $293,243 16 years $327,502 17 years $364,502 18 years $404,463 19 years $447,620 20 years $494,229 21 years $544,568 22 years $598,933 23 years $657,648 24 years $721,059 25 years $789,544 26 years $863,508 27 years $943,388 28 years $1.0 million 29 years $1.1 million 30 years $1.2 million Data source: author. Instead of working longer, or in addition to doing so, you might also ease into retirement by working a little in your first few years of retirement. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. A part-time job can also give your days more structure and opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Be aware, though, that if you're planning to start collecting Social Security benefits before your full retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you want to work some then, too, your benefits may be reduced. As the Social Security Administration explains: ""If you're younger than full retirement age during all of 2017, we must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $16,920."" The year you reach your full retirement age, the earning limit jumps to $44,880, and the penalty decreases to $1 withheld for every $3 earned above the limit. Fortunately, though, the money withheld isn't lost. Instead, it's factored into the benefit checks you receive later, which end up increased. The health insurance coverage you choose can have an effect on how much you spend out of pocket on healthcare in retirement. (This is a big deal: According to Fidelity Investments, a 65-year-old couple retiring today will spend, on average, a total of $275,000 out of pocket on healthcare.) Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The table below shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: Growing For: Growing at 8% Growing at 10% Growing at 12% 15 years $161,284 $192,224 $229,643 20 years $271,826 $346,514 $443,843 25 years $434,239 $595,000 $821,337 30 years $672,900 $995,189 $1.5 million Data source: author. A 401(k) has even more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 and in 2018 it's 18.500 -- plus an additional $6,000 is allowed in both years for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and increasingly available Roth 401(k)s, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! Having a portfolio of stocks in retirement means you can sell shares for income at any time. But if you're holding dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! For example, a $300,000 portfolio with an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll likely receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield National Grid 6.2% AT&T 5.8% Verizon 4.9% Pfizer 3.7% AbbVie 3.1% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can serve you well, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.7%. Image source: Getty Images. Another way to boost your retirement income is to get it from the equity in your home -- via a reverse mortgage. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- such as when you move into a nursing home or die. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell the home unless they can afford to pay off the loan. Still, if you need additional income in retirement and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. You can increase your retirement income by spending less of it on home-related expenses. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, you can boost your retirement income by being savvy about strategies that can increase your Social Security income. For starters, you can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us. If you're married, you can maximize your benefits by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or as early as age 62, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks as survivor benefits instead of their own smaller checks. If you've figured out how much money you'll need in retirement and you're worried about how you'll generate the income you'll need, consider some of the strategies above. They can put hundreds or even thousands of dollars more in your pocket each year. ","

You can try Quartz membership for free Access your Quartz account Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer appeared distraught at a US Senate hearing Wednesday (Nov. 8) on the unprecedented data breaches at the company during her tenure. “As you know, Yahoo was the victim of criminal, state-sponsored attacks on its systems, resulting in the theft of certain user information,” Mayer said in her opening remarks, rarely looking up from her notes. “As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure, and I want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users.” Yahoo disclosed in October that a 2013 breach initially thought to have affected 1 billion user accounts had actually compromised every single account that existed at the time, a staggering 3 billion. Mayer resigned in June after its acquisition by Verizon closed. She had been in the job for about five years. Mayer hadn’t wanted to testify, declining multiple requests. She appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday after US lawmakers subpoenaed her late last month, according to The Hill. A spokesperson for Mayer contested this version of events to The Hill, saying she was testifying voluntarily. On Wednesday, Mayer was seated in the center of the five-member panel of executives who appeared to testify on data breaches, which also included Richard Smith, the former Equifax CEO who “retired” shortly after the company disclosed a data breach that compromised the personal information of 143 million Americans. US lawmakers have grown increasingly skeptical of the power and intimate user details amassed by big technology companies. Representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter answered questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week as part of the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. That skepticism was on display as the Senate Commerce Committee questioned Mayer, with a key exchange occurring between her and senator Bill Nelson. Nelson: At this point, I’m wondering that there’s no such thing as data security. When you think of a sophisticated state actor such as China or Russia, your companies can’t stand up against them. The only person or institution that can stand up against them is the National Security Agency. And what we’re going to see in the future for not only personally identifiable information but also the state secrets of our country, many of which are critical infrastructure as represented by companies such as yours, there’s going to have to be a cooperation between the most sophisticated player in the United States, which is the NSA, and you all. Otherwise we, Americans, are not going to have any more privacy. And if we don’t do something, and if you all don’t do something to change this, we’re going to be right back here, on additional hearings, coming up on this same topic. Now Ms. Mayer, what do you think? You had a sophisticated state actor coming after you. How do you really think that you could have protected yourself? Mayer: Even robust defense and processes are not sufficient to protect against a state sponsored attack, especially one that’s extremely sophisticated and persistent. We at Yahoo cooperated with law enforcement and brought these breaches and intrusions to the attention of law enforcement, swiftly each time they were detected. And the DOJ and FBI were of great assistance to the company in identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Nelson: But that’s an admission that you’re not protected against a state actor. A few minutes later, speaking to an executive from Yahoo parent Verizon, Nelson added that protecting consumer privacy was “going to take an attitude change among companies such as yours.” ",Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was grilled by a senate committee over its massive data breach — Quartz,0.9933

McKinnon,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 7, 2017 7:22 p.m. ET Mayer to appear Wednesday in data-breach hearing By WASHINGTON — A Senate committee moved last month to force former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer to testify in a hearing Wednesday about corporate data breaches, after she initially declined lawmakers’ invitation. The Senate Commerce Committee’s authorization of the subpoena, an unusual move, underscores lawmakers’ growing concern over data breaches. It also highlights the potential stakes for Mayer, once one of the nation’s most celebrated CEOs, in testifying about Yahoo’s massive data breaches and subsequent stumbles in disclosing them. The committee authorized its subpoena late last month after Mayer declined the panel’s invitation to testify voluntarily, according to committee aides.

306,,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc have both expressed interest in acquiring a significant part of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s assets, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. News of competing interest in some of Murdoch’s assets broke even though the U.S. Justice Department was preparing a lawsuit to block AT&T Inc, the largest pay-TV provider in the United States, from buying Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, according to a source. This raised questions about the U.S. government’s willingness to allow large media industry mergers. The Fox assets that buyers have expressed interest in  include Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India, and the European pay TV provider Sky Plc. These units have also been the subject of recent talks between Fox and Walt Disney Co, one of the sources said. Fox shares jumped nearly 8.0 percent in after-hours trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported the news.        Shares of Viacom Inc and CBS Corp also rose more than 2.0 percent, a sign investors may see them as potential targets also. Comcast has approached Fox about its interest, and talks are in early stages, the source added, requesting anonymity. There is no guarantee that talks between the companies will result in a deal. Fox, Comcast and Verizon declined comment. After Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal in 2011, buying the Fox assets would give Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States, an international distribution footprint through ownership of Sky and Star in India. Comcast has steadily boosted its ownership of content over the years and acquiring Fox’s assets would further position Comcast as a diversified conglomerate to rival Disney, analysts said. The deal would bulk up its NBCUniversal unit, which acquired Dreamworks Animation for $3.8 billion last year, as well as increase its ownership stake in video streaming service Hulu. Verizon is also in the early stages of exploring a deal, one of the sources said. A deal could give the U.S. No. 1 wireless phone carrier ownership of movies and TV shows to stream to its mobile subscribers. Acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for Verizon, which has focused its media deals around advertising technology and internet properties. Verizon spent $4.48 billion acquiring the core business of Yahoo, which it merged with AOL this year to form a venture called Oath. Led by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, Oath owns more than 50 brands including HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr. Roger Entner, an analyst of Recon Analytics, said, “It is undeniable that there is a trend of combining content with distribution.” Verizon, which has said it is launching a new streaming service, could have more targeted advertising with a vertically integrated platform, he added. Traditional cable television networks have been struggling with faster-than-expected subscriber erosion in the competition with streaming services like Netflix Inc  and Amazon.com Inc. To increase its scale, Fox tried to buy Time Warner Inc. three years ago and last year announced its intention to buy the rest of Sky beyond the 39 percent it already owns. The moves also come after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday voted to remove key roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing new deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media.

308,,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"(Reuters) - Twenty-First Century Fox Inc shares were up 3 percent in trading on Friday after sources said both Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc were interested in buying parts of its studio and TV operations. A week after reports of interest from Walt Disney Co in buying out much of Rupert Murdoch’s U.S. film and television empire, the sources hinted at the prospect of a battle between other media suitors for the assets. Buyers have expressed interest in Fox’s production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic, and international assets such as the Star network in India and Sky Plc, sources told Reuters on Thursday. “Either Disney or Comcast would be a good fit, but its always about price and neither has to be a strategic buyer, only opportunistic,” said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon. Shares of other media companies which could be dragged into a round of consolidation of U.S. film and TV production and distribution were largely unchanged. Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States,  has steadily boosted its content ownership over the years and buying Fox’s assets would give it an international distribution footprint and strengthen its position against Disney. Traditional media companies have been struggling with subscriber declines as streaming service Netflix has gained traction with younger audiences that shun traditional cable and satellite offerings. Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser remains uncertain as to whether the Murdoch family is seriously entertaining offers. Wieser surmised that all the interest in Fox by other companies probably came after they heard something regarding Disney’s potential interest that was at least enough to take a meeting. “Previously, no-one would have guessed that such a meeting would have ever occurred. That’s enough for other companies to get their bankers working on something to attempt to get a meeting of their own,” he said. Verizon shares were up 1.4 percent, while Comcast and Netflix shares were down about 1 percent. Fox and Disney are partial co-owners of Hulu, a streaming service that offers on-demand and live TV packages. Hulu is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner Inc. “I think if Time Warner doesn’t end up being bought by AT&T - it looks like that’s going to get blocked - that would be an interesting combination... Time Warner-Fox or Disney-Fox,” Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin told Reuters. Although acquisition of a movie studio and cable channels would be a departure for wireless carrier Verizon, its interest in Fox assets was likely piqued by rival AT&T’s bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner, which is awaiting regulatory approval. “(I am) skeptical of a Verizon deal, creative businesses are very tough to manage for an outsider,” Logsdon said. Fox’s other assets include Fox television network, Fox News Channel and Fox Entertainment Group, which owns the popular movies studio 20th Century Fox. Fox shares have gained about 9 percent in value in the last six months. ","

309,,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.” Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices. ","

311, ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is set to consider a major cellphone privacy case later this month, but leading players in the wireless industry that is at the center of the closely watched dispute are keeping their distance. The case, to be heard by the justices on Nov. 29, involves whether a warrant is required for authorities to obtain cellphone location information that could implicate criminal suspects, the latest in a string of Supreme Court cases on privacy rights in the digital age. It has become the latest example of how American phone carriers have been reluctant to engage in data privacy disputes — especially those that may pit them against the U.S. government — despite their role as custodians of customer data, legal experts and privacy advocates say. Of the four major U.S. mobile phone carriers — Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc — only Verizon has taken a stand in the case. Verizon joined a legal brief with technology companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google and Apple Inc calling for stronger protections for the privacy of customer data. Wireless industry trade group CTIA has shied away from the case, the most significant in years on phone privacy. Digital right advocates have criticized the industry’s hands-off approach. “Few private actors have been more involved in the erosion of Americans’ privacy than the telecoms, particularly over the last 15 years,” said Alex Abdo, a senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York, which filed a brief supporting expanded privacy rights in the case. “They have been silent for almost all that time.” Despite massive growth in the amount and types of customer data stored by phone and tech companies, U.S. law on how to treat that information has barely changed during that period. Some tech firms have urged reforms that would ensure privacy protections for customer data. Microsoft and Google both opposed the government’s attempts to obtain customer data stored on foreign servers, a central issue in the other major tech case currently before the Supreme Court. CTIA, AT&T and T-Mobile declined to comment on the current case. Sprint spokeswoman Lisa Belot said the company had not taken a position on it. Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the case “highlights the ever-existing need to find the right balance between law enforcement and privacy, and raises tough questions about how to apply old statutes and legal doctrines to modern technologies.” Although the legal fight is about location information, “the Supreme Court’s decision is likely to impact how the government obtains other sensitive types of information from many other types of providers,” Young added. The Supreme Court twice in recent years has ruled on how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement authorities. Cellphone location records are becoming increasingly important in criminal investigations, with authorities routinely requesting and receiving this data from wireless providers. The four major wireless carriers handle thousands of requests from law enforcement annually for this data. Such data shows which local cellphone towers that phone users connected to when they made calls. Police can use past data to determine if a suspect was in the vicinity of a crime. The justices will hear an appeal by a man named Timothy Carpenter who was convicted in armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan. Police helped establish Carpenter was near the scene of robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores by securing past cell site location information from his cellphone carrier, MetroPCS, now owned by T-Mobile. Carpenter’s American Civil Liberties Union lawyers argued that police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, in light of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Based on a provision of a 1986 law called the Stored Communications Act, the Justice Department said probable cause was not needed, but rather the lesser “reasonable grounds,” to show that records are “relevant and material” to an investigation. Civil liberties groups said that law did not anticipate the way mobile devices would become huge data depositories. A ruling favoring Carpenter would set a precedent that could be applied to other forms of data. Investigations on a range of issues, including public corruption and identity theft, would be threatened if Carpenter wins, the National District Attorneys Association said in a legal brief. Unlike internet firms, telephone providers require government licenses to operate and many have signed contractual agreements that mandate cooperation with the government on legal processes, said Albert Gidari, a lawyer who represented phone and internet companies on surveillance issues for 20 years. Digital rights activists said this fact makes U.S. carriers reluctant to pick privacy fights with the government. “On these issues,” Gidari said, “it does not serve them to be very vocal.” ","

312, ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved the use of new technology that will improve picture quality on mobile phones, tablets and television, but also raises significant privacy concerns by giving advertisers dramatically more data about viewing habits. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 to allow broadcasters to voluntarily use the new technology, dubbed ATSC 3.0, which would allow for more precise geolocating of television signals, ultra-high definition picture quality and more interactive programming, like new educational content for children and multiple angles of live sporting events. The system uses precision broadcasting and targets emergency or weather alerts on a street-by-street basis. The system could allow broadcasters to wake up a receiver to broadcast emergency alerts. The alerts could include maps, storm tracks and evacuation routes. The new standard would also let broadcasters activate a TV set that is turned off to send emergency alerts. Current televisions cannot carry the new signal and the FCC on Thursday said it was only requiring broadcasting both signals for five years after deploying the next-generation technology. Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc last month called the new standard “the Holy Grail” for the advertiser because it tells them who is watching and where. But Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said the new technology “contemplates targeted advertisements that would be ‘relevant to you and what you actually might want to see.’ This raises questions about how advertisers and broadcasters will gather the demographic information from consumers which are necessary to do targeted advertisements.” [nL2N1N11R0] Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said the new technology would force consumers to buy new televisions. “The FCC calls this approach market driven. That’s right — because we will all be forced into the market for new television sets or devices.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai defended the proposal, calling concerns about buying new devices “hypothetical.” He added five years is “a long time. We’ll have to see how the standard develops.” One issue is whether broadcasters will be able to pass on the costs of advanced broadcast signals through higher retransmissions fees and demand providers carry the signals. The National Association of Broadcasters, which represents Tegna Inc, Comcast Corp, CBS Corp, Walt Disney Co, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and others, petitioned the FCC in April 2016 to approve the new standard. “This is game-changing technology for broadcasting and our viewers,” the group said Thursday. Many companies have raised concerns about costs, including AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Cable, satellite and other pay TV providers “would incur significant costs to receive, transmit, and deliver ATSC 3.0 signals to subscribers, including for network and subscriber equipment,” Verizon said. Many nations are considering the new standard. South Korea adopted the ATSC 3.0 standard in 2016. ","

314, ,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is poised to vote on Dec. 14 to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by former President Barack Obama. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal would repeal rules that bar internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. Here are some questions and answers about net neutrality and the FCC’s plans. What is in the proposal and what happens next? The FCC, an independent U.S. government agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, TV, wire, satellite and cable, has three Republican commissioners including Pai and two Democrats and is all but certain to approve Pai’s proposal. That would undo regulations put in place in 2015 at Democrat Obama’s urging that treat ISPs like public utilities to guarantee the open nature of the internet. It would also roll back the FCC’s significant oversight over the providers and their conduct. Pai’s proposal would require ISPs to disclose if they allow content blocking, slowing though so-called throttling, or paid prioritization in which a third-party owner pays an ISP to have their content move more quickly. It would also eliminate the internet conduct standard that gives the FCC broad discretion to bar ISP practices it deems improper. The new rules could into effect as early as January, although a court challenge is expected. What does this mean for consumers? Consumers could see changes, but any shift would likely take a long time. A major concern raised by consumer advocates is that ISPs could block or slow traffic to websites or services of their choosing, playing an outsized role in what users can and cannot access. Providers could also give preferential treatment to their own content or websites that pay extra fees, consumer advocates said. ISPs could impede video streaming services and consumers’ ability to make free or inexpensive phone calls over the internet, advocates said. The nonprofit Consumers Union said a repeal could lead to higher consumer prices for existing internet access and speeds. The telecommunications industry trade group USTelecom, which represents some leading ISPs, disputed that idea and said broadband prices in the United States had been trending downward before the Obama-era rules, and repealing the regulations would allow that to continue. What businesses support the repeal? ISPs including AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc favored a repeal. USTelecom said Pai’s move would boost broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades. It said the 2015 rules applied utility-style regulations designed for the 1930s telephone system to ISPs but no other internet companies. It said repealing the rules would strengthen consumer protections by giving authority regarding the internet to a single U.S. regulator, the Federal Trade Commission. What businesses oppose the repeal? The Internet Association, representing major technology firms, had urged the FCC to retain the 2015 regulations. The group includes Google parent Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, video streaming service Netflix Inc, Microsoft Corp, ride-hailing company Uber, reviews business Yelp Inc, payments company PayPal Holdings Inc and others. The group said the 2015 rules protect a “virtuous circle” of innovation that helps the broader U.S. economy as businesses turn to cloud-based technology. It added that Pai’s plan would subject startups to discrimination from ISP-owned or preferred content. The group said paid prioritization would cause a “cable-ization” of the internet in which businesses that provide content, application or services would have to negotiate carriage deals on ISP networks.

Wells Fargo’s Jennifer Fritzsche increased her price target to $50 from $48, suggesting that “much of the bad news is behind the stock in terms of wireless service revenue declines.” (See also: Sprint Now Offering Free Hulu Service.) Last month, Verizon posted fiscal Q3 results in which profit came in flat at $0.89 per share and revenue grew 2.5% year-over-year (YOY) at $31.7 billion. Wireless, the company’s largest business segment, slumped 2.4% while its wireless service business fell 5.1%. Moving forward, Wells expects a “more rational” pricing environment in wireless as benefiting Verizon the most out of its competitors. She noted that wireless accounts for 68% of the telecommunications conglomerate’s total revenue. Further, Fritzsche sees opportunity in Verizon’s continued investments in fiber technology, which should “generate material cost savings” and reduce the cost of constant customer acquisition as the company is forced to replace old customers lost to churn. “We think Verizon is an attractive yield play, with its 5.3% dividend yield nearly 100 basis points above its long-term average,” wrote the Wells analyst. “We expect Verizon to grow free cash flow nearly 6% in 2018 as working capital headwinds from device purchases moderate, service revenue stabilizes and pension funding requirements drop.” (See also: Verizon Needs Growth To Drive Stock Price Higher.)

317,Evelyn Cheng,11232017,CNBC,11162017,"Comcast has approached 21st Century Fox and expressed interest in an acquisition of some of Fox's assets, sources said Thursday. Talks are ongoing, a source said. Comcast is interested in the same set of assets that Disney approached Fox about earlier this year, sources said. Also of interest to Comcast is acquiring the international assets of Fox, given that the Philadelphia-based company is heavily concentrated in the U.S. CNBC reported last week, citing sources, that 21st Century Fox has been holding talks to sell most of the company to Disney, leaving only an entity focused on news and sports. A Comcast-Fox deal would have the same regulatory issues that Disney would have in acquiring the Fox assets, the sources said. Disney under U.S. rules could not own two broadcast networks. And that would be the same case with Comcast. Neither company is talking about purchasing all of Fox, sources told CNBC.

Verizon stock has lost 15% of its value since the year began, and with barely a month remaining in the year, there's not much time left for Verizon to make up for lost ground. Next year, however, could be another matter. Earlier this morning, investment banker Wells Fargo announced it is upgrading Verizon stock to outperform and assigning the stock a $50 price target over the next 12 months. If the analyst is right, 2018 could see Verizon make up much of its losses from 2017, and deliver a 10% profit -- and Verizon's generous 5.2% dividend yield on top of that. Here are three things you need to know. Operator? Wells Fargo would like to place a call -- to buy Verizon stock. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon reported its fiscal Q3 earnings numbers last month. Revenue inched up only 2.5% year over year to $31.7 billion, and profits were flat at $0.89 per diluted share. Within the company's two main business segments, however, results differed wildly. Things were both better, and worse, in Verizon smaller wireline business (landlines and Fios). Here, Verizon boasted a 1.1% revenue growth rate, but profits declined 11% year over year, and wireline still remains mired at a minuscule 0.8% operating profit margin. In short, the news was not great at Verizon last quarter. And yet, according to Wells Fargo, now that Q3 is in the rearview mirror, ""much of the bad news is behind the stock."" In Wells' opinion, the wireless business is in a trough right now. But going forward, Wells Fargo believes that more ""rational pricing"" among competing wireless providers will boost revenue in Verizon's wireless division. If Wells is right about that, the strong profit margins that Verizon earns in wireless should yield substantial profit growth as revenue resumes growing. As TheFly.com explains today in a note on Wells Fargo's upgrade, however, the analyst sees the greater opportunity for improvement in Verizon's wireline division. According to the analyst, Verizon's continued investments in fiber technology should ""generate material cost savings"" for the company. Fiber may even reduce Verizon's costs of constantly acquiring new customers to replace old customers lost due to customer churn. Earlier this month, J.D. Power and Associates surveyed more than 26,000 cable and internet users and concluded that Verizon's television and internet services are ""Highest Ranked by Customers for Residential Internet and Television Service Satisfaction in the East."" Polling customers on such subjects as network performance and reliability, cost of service, billing, communication, customer service, and programming choices, J.D. Power found that even in an industry as disliked as cable television, customers at least seem to prefer Verizon over alternatives such as Comcast, Cox, and Charter. (For the record, and to be fair, both Charter and Cox topped J.D. Power's rankings in the American South and West regions, respectively. In the North, AT&T trumped all comers. But in the one region where Verizon was allowed to compete head to head with these rivals, it came out on top.) On top of all this, Wells Fargo also argues that with its 15% decline in share price since the year's beginning, Verizon's valuation is looking more attractive today -- but it's here that I fear Wells Fargo's reasoning breaks down. Wells Fargo starts off by describing Verizon as an ""attractive yield play"" based on the company's 5.2% dividend yield -- well and good. The problem is that Wells Fargo then goes on to praise Verizon for its improved free cash flow, and arguing that this, too, is a mark in Verizon stock's favor. But it isn't. Over the past four reported quarters, Verizon has earned just over $15.9 billion in reported net income under GAAP, resulting in an enticingly low (-seeming) P/E ratio of just 11.7. Problem is, Verizon's free cash flow number entirely fails to back up that reported profit. Cash from operations at Verizon over the past year has amounted to $22.2 billion. Unfortunately, minus $16.9 billion in capital expenditure, that leaves free cash flow of only $5.3 billion for the period. Divided into Verizon's $185.3 billion market capitalization, this results in a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 35 -- much more expensive than the stock's low P/E ratio makes it appear. Whatever the prospects for a revival of revenue growth at Verizon's wireless division, and whatever Verizon's chances of pulling its wireline operating profit margin back above 1%, I simply don't believe these prospects are great enough to justify paying 35 times free cash flow for Verizon stock today. If you ask me, Verizon Communications stock simply costs too much. Wells Fargo is wrong to recommend it. ","

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) each reported lower revenue through the first nine months of 2017. Yet investors have had dramatically different responses to recent operating trends for these companies. McDonald's stock is outpacing the broader market's by a wide margin, Coke is underperforming, and Verizon is deep in negative territory with a 15% loss. Below, we'll stack these Dow giants against each other to see which might make the better buy for investors today. Metric Coca-Cola McDonald's Verizon Market capitalization $195 billion $135 billion $185 billion Operating profit margin 20% 40% 25% Dividend yield 3.2% 2.4% 5.2% Performance year to date 10% 37% (15%) Profit margin is for the trailing 12 months. Stock performance is through Nov. 17. Data sources: Company financial filings, YCharts. McDonald's is the clear winner in this matchup when it comes to operating momentum. The fast-food giant's customer traffic trends are improving across each of its geographies today, including in the critical U.S. segment. This rebound allowed Mickey D's to post a 6% spike in comparable-store sales in late October to mark just a slight slowdown from the prior quarter's 6.6% jump. Image source: Getty Images. Coke's results look tame in comparison. The beverage titan's sales volume is flat so far this year after having risen by 1% last year and by 2% in 2015. Verizon brings up third place on this metric, as its wireless revenue is down 3%. The communications giant has managed a slight uptick in its customer base, but that improvement is being overwhelmed by lower average monthly payments. The same general story applies to profit growth. Sure, Coca-Cola is set to raise its operating margin through a refranchising initiative that's spinning bottlers out of its business. And Verizon has aggressive cost-cutting plans that should see it remove $10 billion from its expense burden over the next four years. Yet McDonald's has the brightest outlook for improving profitability -- and that was true even before its recent uptick in sales growth. The fast-food titan is busy reducing its share of company-owned locations to just 5% from the 15% it controlled at the end of 2016. That refranchising strategy is lowering reported earnings. In fact, sales are down 6% so far this year. But in exchange, CEO Steve Easterbrook and his team get a higher proportion of those steady, repeatable, and highly profitable franchise fees. The shift has already produced a spike in operating margin up to 38% of sales from 33% a year ago. Management is targeting further gains on this metric with profitability reaching the mid-40s by late 2019. VZ Operating Margin (TTM). Data by YCharts. The fact that these companies operate in different industries limits the usefulness of direct comparisons between their valuations. Still, it's fair to say that Verizon is the cheapest of the bunch. Its price-to-earnings ratio is less than half the 25 times an investor would have to pay to buy either Coca Cola or McDonald's today. Verizon is also valued well below the broader market average. Investors seeking a conservative stock purchase -- with an unusually high yield -- might consider Verizon a solid bet. Just keep in mind that this dividend has only grown for 11 consecutive years, compared to 56 for Coke and 42 for McDonald's. In my view, the fast-food giant makes the best all-around purchase today, though, due to its healthy operating trends and improving profitability. Sure, Mickey D's 2.4% yield is the lowest of the group. Yet that payout should grow quickly since it is the main avenue by which management is planning to send  $23 billion to shareholders in the next few years. ","
      
    Best Buy: Coca-Cola, McDonald's, or Verizon? -- The Motley Fool

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been on a tear over the last few years, winning the lion's share of postpaid phone net subscriber additions in the industry. Those gains have come largely at the expense of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). T-Mobile has been extremely aggressive with its Un-carrier moves, many of which have been extremely attractive to consumers but harmed industry economics like its move to unlimited data plans. As a result, its EBITDA margin sits well below those of AT&T and Verizon. Management has big plans to grow free cash flow over the next few years. But in order to do so, it has to take care of its biggest disadvantage. ""Our disadvantage all along has been scale,"" CFO Braxton Carter told investors at a recent conference. ""And to achieve the margins that are possible to be achieved in the U.S., we have to have that scale."" Image source: T-Mobile. As of the end of the third quarter, T-Mobile had about 33 million postpaid phone subscribers and 20 million prepaid subscribers. In comparison, AT&T has about 64 million postpaid phone subscribers and 14 million prepaid subscribers. Verizon doesn't break out postpaid phone subscribers, but has nearly 110 million postpaid connections on its network and nearly 6 million prepaid subscribers. Despite its recent success, T-Mobile is still small compared to the two market leaders. That's why it's repeatedly shown interest in merging with Sprint (NYSE:S), which is even smaller than T-Mobile. Over the last couple years, T-Mobile has taken steps to improve its network, expanding it into markets where it doesn't even have a retail presence. This year it's rapidly building out retail locations in new markets. Carter says the effects of these new storefronts can take up a year to show up in terms of subscriber additions. T-Mobile is also dead last in terms of enterprise customers. AT&T has nearly twice as many business subscribers as it does consumer subscribers, and the gap is growing wider as the business segment cannibalizes consumer customers. Carter says T-Mobile will apply similar Un-carrier initiatives to the enterprise market as it did for the consumer market to drive subscriber growth. With the wireless service market in the United States near saturation, T-Mobile's growth will have to come from somewhere, especially now that a merger with Sprint is off the table. AT&T and Verizon are most likely to cede customers to T-Mobile simply because that's where most customers are today. But Carter noted that scale would allow T-Mobile to become less aggressive with its consumer pricing and promotions. After all, T-Mobile needs to expand margins in order to show the significant cash flow growth it's aiming for over the next couple years. That means less margin pressure on AT&T and Verizon as well. While a merger with Sprint would have been more beneficial for AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile already seems to have plans to reduce margin pressure going forward. AT&T seems resigned to sacrificing low-margin subscribers to T-Mobile, and Verizon has managed to withstand the onslaught of pressure from T-Mobile relatively well recently. Considering AT&T's concentration of enterprise customers, investors can expect that trend to continue as T-Mobile shifts its focus to enterprise customers. But improving scale at T-Mobile should produce better profits for the entire industry. ","
      
    This Is T-Mobile's Biggest Disadvantage -- The Motley Fool

It shouldn't be a big surprise that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is still winning over more customers from its competitors than it's losing. But CFO Braxton Carter gave some details about how much better T-Mobile is doing in the fourth quarter versus Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Sprint (NYSE:S) than it did last quarter. ""So far, in the fourth quarter, our porting ratios are up significantly,"" Carter said at a recent investors conference. ""We ended the third quarter at a porting ratio of 1.53. We're now 1.73 on porting ratios to date this quarter. And our porting ratios are up against every carrier."" So, what exactly continues to drive higher porting ratios for T-Mobile -- the ratio of customers moving their phone number to T-Mobile over the ratio moving their number away? Carter pointed to two key factors: the new iPhone release and its decision to bundle Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) with its unlimited plans. Image source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile was the last of the four major carriers to start offering the iPhone to its customers. As a result, its base of iPhone users is relatively small, especially compared to AT&T and Verizon. So, whenever a new iPhone comes out, it's a big opportunity for T-Mobile to win over new subscribers as they upgrade their phones. In the past, T-Mobile has been ultra aggressive in offering discounts on the iPhone. But its offer was much more moderate this year after it found its competitors copying its promotions, practically nullifying any positive impact. Carter views the higher price of the iPhones, particularly the iPhone X, as a factor that could cause consumers to really evaluate their carrier options. Considering T-Mobile has positioned itself to provide one of the best values in wireless service, it's well positioned to capitalize on consumers looking to offset higher device prices. Around two-thirds of all iPhones in the United States are models from more than two years ago. Nearly all of those devices should be paid off or close to it if they were on equipment installment plans. That represents millions of potential customers. If just a few extra thousand switch to T-Mobile when making their decision, it could have a big impact on the company's porting ratios. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile is a stand-alone wireless carrier. It doesn't have any services it can bundle. Since acquiring DirecTV, AT&T has been able to offer a nationwide service bundle for its wireless and television business. This year, it's taken bundling a step further, offering free HBO to its wireless subscribers and offering discounts for its various television packages. Verizon also has a small wireline business it can bundle with wireless in the regions where it operates video and home internet service. T-Mobile responded in September by offering free Netflix to its subscribers. Netflix has over 51 million paid subscribers in the United States as of the end of the third quarter. It's very likely the majority of households are paying for Netflix. So, T-Mobile isn't pushing something its customers probably don't want to boost revenue; it's picking up the tab for something customers are already paying for out of pocket. Bundling Netflix is producing better user retention for T-Mobile, according to Carter. There's now a switching cost for customers thinking about leaving T-Mobile, just as there is if a customer wants to ditch AT&T's bundle of wireless, TV, and HBO. Sprint recently copied the strategy, offering its customers free Hulu. Hulu doesn't have quite the same demand as Netflix, so it likely won't have as strong of an effect as offering Netflix does. T-Mobile is off to a strong start this quarter. And as we head into seasonally strong periods for both the iPhone and Netflix, it could get stronger as the quarter progresses. ","

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone X has made waves in the tech sphere not only for its impressive specs but also for its price tag. Without a carrier deal, the 64GB iPhone X is going to cost you $999 from Apple, while the 256GB iPhone X is going to cost $1,149. This redesigned 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone was first released on Nov. 3, and includes an edge-to-edge OLED screen, a TrueDetect camera system to enable Face ID unlocking, and Animoji to create animated emojis. If you want to have the latest and greatest but don't want to break the bank, you might be able to swing it with a trade-in deal. The new iPhoneX has a less alarming price tag if you sign a deal at one of the four major carriers: Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sprint (NYSE:S), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), or AT&T (NYSE:T). The new iPhoneX has a less alarming price tag if you do a trade-in deal at one of the four major carriers. If you want the short answer, Sprint has the all-around cheapest deal if you want an individual unlimited data plan and the new iPhoneX. While the other three major carriers offer $300 off the iPhoneX with a trade-in deal, Sprint offers a generous $350 off the device if you trade in an eligible phone. Sprint is also tied for the lowest price on an unlimited data plan for one line: $60 per month for a plan that includes HD video and mobile hotspots. AT&T also offers $60 per month for its Unlimited Choice plan, but it has slower speeds, no HD video, and no mobile hotspots. AT&T's premium Unlimited Plus plan goes for $90. Finally, Verizon's lowest unlimited data plan for one line is $75, while T-Mobile's is $70. If you want a more detailed look at what the combo would cost at each carrier, keep reading. Lowest possible iPhone X cost: $699.99 ($300 off) Unlimited for one line: $75 per month If you want $300 off the 64GB $999.99 10th anniversary iPhone X from Verizon, you will need to follow these three steps: 1. Purchase the iPhone X with monthly payments of $41.66 spread out over two years. The discount will be paid back to you over the two years, so you have to commit to the phone and the unlimited plan for at least 24 months. 2. Sign up for a Verizon unlimited plan if you're not already on it. 3. Trade in your old phone. The discount on the iPhone X is dependent on the phone you have to trade in. The iPhone 6S or a later version will get you $300 off. The iPhone 6 series will get you $200 off, and the iPhone 5 series will get you $100 off.

Lowest possible iPhone X cost: $699.99 ($300 off) Unlimited for one line: $70 per month If you want $300 off the $999.99 iPhone from T-Mobile, you need to pay $279.99 upfront and then $30 per month for 24 months. You will get the $300 back over two years in monthly installments of $12.50.

In AT&T's latest earnings call, CFO John Stephens said the company believed it was in a good position to compete with the other big carriers without offering aggressive promotions on the new iPhones released this fall. ""And as you can see, our margins are very solid and the performance has been great,"" Stephens said. ""But we believe we can compete and win based on our product offerings and that promotional activity of an extensive nature is not necessary."" However, customers can still use the company's regular trade-in program to get credit to apply for new iPhones. This means for each phone that costs more than $20, you can get $200 in credits to put toward the iPhone X so long as your used device is in good physical and working condition, an AT&T rep said. However, if you have a newer device, such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, then you can get $300 in credits. Lowest possible iPhone X cost: $649.68 ($350 off) Unlimited for one line: $60 per month If you want $350 off the iPhoneX at Sprint, you can sign a deal through its Sprint Flex leasing for $22.22 per month for 18 months if you trade in an older eligible device.

Altaba (NASDAQ:AABA) just published an update on the focused investing company's financial health. The company formerly known as Yahoo! is a very different beast since it sold its operations to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and refocused on the management of a few investments overseas. The company owns 14.7% of China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and a 35% stake in former subsidiary Yahoo Japan, an online search and marketing service in the land of the rising sun. How have these core investments treated Altaba since the July update? Let's have a look. Investment Fair Value as of Sept. 30, 2017 Fair Value as of June 16, 2017 Change Alibaba $66.2 billion $51.8 million 28% Yahoo Japan $9.6 billion $8.7 billion 10% Total Altaba Investments $84.8 billion $74.2 billion 14% Data source: Altaba SEC filings. Beyond the two flagship holdings, Altaba holds $5.5 billion of corporate bonds, $1.6 billion in certificates of deposit, and another $1.2 billion in an assortment of smaller investments. The Excalibur IP operation, which holds the licensing rights to Yahoo!'s portfolio of technology patents, did not move over to Verizon, and accounts for $675 million of Altaba's asset value today. But 78% of Altaba's total investment portfolio consists of Alibaba shares. Alibaba's stock has gained 39% since Altaba was formed, and Altaba shares followed along with a 37% gain. Over the same period, Yahoo Japan offered a 5% return, and the S&P 500 index gained 6%. Image source: Alibaba. Altaba is not a very active trader. The company has neither sold not bought a single share of Alibaba or Yahoo Japan in its (admittedly short) history, and also leaves most of its smaller holdings untouched. The company did unload a $69.3 million stake in Snap (NYSE:SNAP) in September, but that's  a rounding error next to its pair of multibillion-dollar holdings. As always, Altaba shares are trading roughly 30% below the combined value of its investment assets. As my fellow Fool Frank DiPietro has explained, that's due to the tax costs that would be involved in moving those international funds back to American soil. If Altaba ever finds a way to wind down its Asian assets without triggering a large payment to Uncle Sam, share values should rise closer to the firm's net assets value. Under a $5 billion share repurchase program, Altaba has bought back $3.3 billion of its own shares as of Nov. 16. The program is sure to be reapproved with a new multibillion dollar target, since Altaba has promised to return all its cash and holdings to shareholders over time.

It shouldn't be too big of a surprise that Warren Buffett has soured on IBM (NYSE:IBM). The Oracle of Omaha has been unloading his position in Big Blue all year. But IBM isn't the only stock Buffett's been reducing in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. He's also been selling Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and, a bit more surprisingly, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Are the best days behind these stocks? Big ships can't turn on a dime, and IBM is a freighter. Plans to reshape IBM back into a growth company are taking forever, and apparently, Warren Buffett's done waiting. He's been steadily selling Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in IBM all year. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL. IBM was once one of his biggest positions -- he owned over 80 million shares -- but he sold 17 million shares in Q1, nearly 10 million shares in Q2, and another 17 million shares in Q3. As of September 30, he only has 37 million shares left. I suspect that number is even lower now. IBM was formerly a technology powerhouse, but declining demand for its legacy technology solutions hasn't been fully offset by growing demand for its strategic-imperatives businesses. As a result, its year-over-year revenue has declined in 22 straight quarters. During the past three years, trailing 12-month sales have fallen from more than $100 billion to less than $80 billion, despite its investments in the fastest-growing parts of its business, such as cloud computing. IBM's sales only fell 0.4% from one year ago in Q3, but flat isn't very inspiring. Until strategic-imperatives revenue represents a large enough share of sales to return this company to growth, IBM's shares are likely to remain under pressure. Those businesses produced $34.9 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, representing 45% of IBM's total revenue, and sales grew 11% year over year in Q3. IBM's heading in the right direction, but there's still work to be done. Could IBM become a bargain-basement buy at some point? Maybe. It's typically been smart to buy IBM when its trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is about 9.5. It's about 12.4 right now, so share prices will need to fall further, or we'll have to see some significant earnings expansion to get to that level again. Until then, it's hard to argue that there aren't better investment ideas out there. It seems Buffett agrees. IBM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Warren Buffett added Charter Communications to his portfolio in 2014, and over the past three years, he's more than doubled his money. Apparently, that gain is a bit too much for Buffett to pass up because he sold 10% of his Charter Communications stake in the third quarter. Charter Communications has been on a roll since 2016 when it completed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Share prices got an additional boost earlier this year when rumors emerged that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) had approached it about an acquisition, too. However, Charter Communications has given back some of its gains since CEO Tom Ruttledge dashed takeover speculation in September, saying the company's fine going it alone. Perhaps Charter Communications' decision to stay single is enough of an incentive for Buffett to want to book his profit. He still owns 8.5 million shares, so we'll need to see what happens in the fourth quarter before we know for certain that he's moving on to other stocks. In the meantime, I don't see much reason to buy Charter Communications following the past year's rumor-fueled run-up. IMAGE SOURCE: WELLS FARGO. Let's face it... Wells Fargo has lost some of its allure since admitting that workers opened millions of fake accounts to meet heavy-handed sales goals. But that doesn't mean that Buffett's bailing on his second-largest holding. Yes, he did finish last quarter with 3.8 million fewer shares than he began the quarter, but his selling was only to keep Berkshire Hathaway's ownership below 10% so that he could avoid Berkshire Hathaway being classified as a bank holding company. Since Wells Fargo has a big buyback program that's continuously reducing its share count, Warren Buffett has to trim his position every quarter just to maintain it at his target 9.8% ownership level. Although Buffett hasn't soured on Wells Fargo, you might want to. Despite industry tailwinds, including a strong economy and rising interest rates, Wells Fargo's adjusted earnings fell year over year, to $1.04 per share. Its net interest income was flat and its net interest margin, or the spread between how much it pays to fund loans and how much it collects in interest, declined to 2.87% quarter over quarter. Noninterest income, mortgage banking income, and total loans also dipped sequentially. Overall, there's no denying that Wells Fargo will remain a banking giant, but I expect its growth from here will be more tepid than it's been in the past. If so, investors might do better buying a different bank stock. Warren Buffett's famous for his disciplined investment approach. His ability to turn over stones and thoroughly understand opportunities and risks allows him to ride out a stock's inevitable downturns more easily than others. Given his penchant for patience, his selling of shares in IBM and Charter Communications should give investors in those two stocks pause. At a minimum, it suggests going back to your investment diary to make sure the reason why you bought shares still is valid. As for Wells Fargo, it's a different story. Buffett seems committed to keeping his ownership in the bank just underneath the crucial 10% mark. As long as this is true, he won't be propping up Wells Fargo's price by buying more shares. Instead, Wells Fargo is going to trade higher or lower based on its ability to move beyond its account scandal, boost its loan growth, and increase its profit. There's an opportunity for it to do that, but that doesn't mean that it's the best bank stock for new investors to be buying. ","
      
    Why Warren Buffett Is Selling These Stocks -- The Motley Fool

327,"Jamal Carnette, CFA",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're like most people, you could use more income. With U.S. salary and wage growth continuing to barely outpace inflation, it's prudent to look for ways to augment your paychecks. One sensible way to do that is by investing in dividend-paying stocks. First, dividends are generally taxed at a lower level than your wages. For qualified dividends (which most of yours are likely to be), the tax rate tops out at 20%, while the marginal tax rates on added wages can run as high as 39.6%. Second, dividend stocks are relatively attractive in the current low-yield interest rate environment. Right now, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields 2.4% and the average 5-year certificate of deposit pays 1.5%, while the broader S&P 500 currently has a dividend yield of 1.9%. Third, in recent history, dividend stocks have the best track record of outperforming inflation. Over the last year, the S&P 500 has increased its cumulative dividend payout by 6.9%, more than double the pace of wage increases. Many fixed-income products have higher current yields but do not increase their annual payouts, and inflation can eat into income-based returns. Image Source: Getty Images One of the most basic techniques of income investing is to purchase high-yielding dividend stocks. The dividend yield is simply the ratio of the current price per share of a company to the dividends per share paid out over the past 12 months. The logic behind buying high-yield stocks is simple: As a shareholder, you are entitled to the dividend, so paying the lowest cost for the largest relative dividends (i.e., the highest yields) would seem to be preferable. However, this may be one of the more dangerous ideas in investing. There are a few significant risks with using dividend yield as your primary criterion for making an investment decision. While it's smart to evaluate a company's past dividend payouts, investors should put more emphasis on how probable it is that the company will be able to continue them. When a large segment of investors become skeptical of a company's prospects due to industry changes, poor management, or economic conditions, they will sell their shares of the company. This depresses the stock price, which has the perverse effect of making the dividend yield more attractive in the short run. This is referred to as a yield trap: If  (or more likely) when the company eventually cuts its dividend payout, the factor that induced you to buy it will be gone. Recently, this was the case with General Electric, which cut its dividend from $0.96 per share to $0.48 per share, a 50% decrease. That said, high-yielding stocks of companies that can turn things around often outperform the greater stock market as investors recognize them to be safer prospects with outsize yields. A mistake many investors make when evaluating a company's ability to pay its dividend is using the common dividend payout ratio (dividends per share/net income per share) and the dividend yield as their only evaluative metrics. However, dividends are paid from cash generation, which can vastly differ from accounting earnings in both the short and long terms. The main discrepancy between net income, (aka, accounting earnings) and cash-flow generation is depreciation, as this is not a cash expense but rather a method of expensing costs of long-term assets like factories or buildings. A much better measure of a company's ability to continue to pay (or raise) its dividend is the free-cash-flow payout ratio, which replaces net income with the free-cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures). This measures the true cash the company is generating versus what it's paying out to shareholders. Additionally, it's a good idea to pay attention to a company's net cash position, as companies with a lot of cash can continue to pay their dividends even the event of temporary operational weaknesses. Data as of Nov. 13, 2017 Within the S&P 500, the current top-yielding stock is CenturyLink. The company's core businesses are in the competitive broadband and telecommunications industries, and it owns a lot of assets in the declining wireline subsegment. CenturyLink does not have the scale of larger competitors like AT&T, Charter Communications, Comcast, and Verizon. Investors continue to have low expectations about its ability to continue servicing the dividend. Recently, the company completed its acquisition of Level 3 Communications, a business and government focused service provider, which should give CenturyLink significant scale that it can use to focus on the enterprise. Management has made defending its dividend a priority, as CEO Glen Post III noted: CenturyLink's management and board of directors see our quarterly cash dividend as an important part of our value proposition for shareholders. Upon completion of the Level 3 acquisition, we anticipate generating nearly a billion dollars in cash synergies, as well as significant cash tax savings from the accelerated recognition of Level 3's net operating losses. These cash savings, along with our focus on profitable growth, are expected to drive increasing free cash flow per share, enhance our financial flexibility and improve our dividend payout ratio. Image Source: Getty Images Like CenturyLink, Macy's is also facing questions about its business model. The department store chain's stock fell more than 50% over the last year, and many investors are quite skeptical of how the business model of traditional retail with fare under intense competition from e-commerce players like Amazon. In the last two years, more than 20 retailers have filed for bankruptcy protection, including Sports Authority, Toys R' Us, and Payless ShoeSource. Many analysts have tried to predict which chain with be next to drop, but my colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg feels it won't be Macy's. He argues that its cash flow can support its dividend, at least in the near term; free cash flow is roughly double what the company paid out in dividends last year. The company is in the midst of restructuring the business, selling less-productive assets to pay down debt and increase operating margins. If the company executes on those plans successfully, investors could strongly benefit, given the current exceedingly bearish outlook the market has on it. In a recurring theme, the third highest-yielding stock in the S&P 500 also faces questions related to its business model. Seagate Technology is a large manufacturer of hard disk drives (HDDs). However, most computers now use solid-state drives (SSDs) for storage, as their performance is better and HDD's cost advantage continues to shrink. Last year, Seagate's primary contender Western Digital acquired SanDisk to pivot to SSD manufacturing, while Seagate remains mostly tethered to HDD technology. Seagate's shares rallied after it reported third-quarter earnings. Sales fell 6%, but the company has been cutting its expenses as well, which helped it produce earnings per share growth. However, the company reported a year-over-year free cash flow decline of 75%, which is a metric long-term income investors should strongly consider before buying shares for the dividend. Everybody wants more income, but it's important to avoid taking unwise risks. Looking for high dividend yields is a good starting point, but on its own, its a poor strategy for picking stocks to deliver long-term income. Do your proper due diligence, and evaluate a company's cash flow, its economic environment, and the probability of a dividend cut before you buy its shares.  ","
      
    What Investors Need to Know About High-Yield Stocks -- The Motley Fool

328,Motley Fool Staff,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. First, it was Disney (NYSE:DIS) looking to buy the lion's share of Fox's (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) entertainment assets. Now it's Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) talking acquisition -- and, worth noting, whichever wins takes majority control of Hulu. Then, they break down their views on why ever-expanding payment platform specialist PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has decided the consumer loans aren't what it wants to be in. It may be less an issue of a business direction choice and more a balance sheet maneuver. A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Comcast is the parent company of NBC, Telemundo, Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation, and apparently, Matty, they're looking for even more content, because Comcast is talking to 21st Century Fox about buying most of Fox's assets, including the movie studio division and National Geographic, and FX Networks. And Disney was in talks with Fox as well. Where is this going? Matt Argersinger: You used to be able to clean the categorize the media entertainment industry into two categories. You had content and you had distribution. And there was kind of a nice marriage relationship there for decades. But because of the success of Netflix, because of the threat that Amazon represents, I think the older legacy media companies have realized that you have to have both. There was always a little bit of overlap, but now we want to actually control both. I think that's why you saw Comcast buy DreamWorks, NBC Universal in recent years. You have the AT&T, Time Warner merger that may or may not happen. And now you have Disney and Comcast, and apparently Verizon as well, looking at Fox's assets. I think, in the mix here, it's mentioned but not really one of the headlines, is that Hulu is part of this deal. Fox owns 30% of Hulu. So, if Disney or Comcast get control of Fox, they now have a majority position in Hulu. And I think that makes that platform much more competitive against Netflix and Amazon. I think a deal is going to happen here. There's just too much interest in those assets. I expect, by the end of the year, there's probably going to be some official acquisition plan in place. Jason Moser: I would not undervalue that Hulu assets. We have that skinny bundle that they offer now. They're still working out some kinks, but I tell you, it's a really great way to cut the cord so to speak and still get a lot of content at a very affordable price. I think they're onto something there. Hill: It's interesting. We hear all the time that content is king. And clearly Fox has looked at their entire portfolio and said, ""We just want to do news and sports."" Shares of PayPal up this week after the company announced it is selling its entire consumer loan portfolio to Synchrony Financial. You tell me, Jason, why doesn't PayPal want to loan me money anymore? Ron Gross: [laughs] It's just you, Chris. Hill: It's just me. Moser: This is more of a shoring up the balance sheet thing. I think, honestly, in the simplest terms, this is a deal that just lets two companies focus on doing what they do best. Synchrony, at its core, is a bank offering credit products, and PayPal is a financial services company that more or less serves as the median through which money is exchanged in this mobile age. So, as you said, it takes a credit portfolio that PayPal used to own in the form of a lot of receivables and basically unloads that onto Synchrony's balance sheet, which is more in line with what they do. It's about $5.8 billion that represents that receivables portfolio. So, the general thinking is, this gives PayPal's management, it frees up a lot of cash that they can then invest back into the business in other forms of products and services they want to bring to market that complement their offerings in anyway. So, put it in context, PayPal currently uses about 50% of their free cash flow annually to fund this credit portfolio. So, this is really going to free up a lot of free cash for them, which I think is ultimately a good thing, and that's why you saw the market react so positively to the news. ","

A spokesperson for Twitter said that at no time was Blackburn’s video censored and that her followers would have been able to still see it. “Because advertisements are served to users who do not necessarily follow an account, we therefore have higher standards for their content,” the Twitter spokesperson said. Twitter in October declined a campaign video advertisement by Blackburn, who announced she is running for the U.S. Senate, saying that a remark by Blackburn about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. Trump is a prolific user of Twitter, often posting his unvarnished thoughts on the news of the day. He used Twitter throughout his presidential campaign to circumvent traditional media and talk directly to voters. Pai has also been a frequent user of the website - acknowledging during the speech, “I love Twitter” - to push his case in favor of the rule changes. On Tuesday afternoon, he even posted a link to his remarks critical of Twitter on his own Twitter account. Following Pai’s remarks on Tuesday, at an event organized by the libertarian-leaning R Street Institute, two other FCC commissioners said they would support his proposal when they vote on Dec. 14. The rules prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others. “So when you get past the wild accusations, fear mongering and hysteria, here’s the boring bottom line,” Pai said. “The plan to restore internet freedom would return us to the light touch, market-based approach under which the internet thrived.” ","

334, ,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed prepared Wednesday to impose new limits on the government's ability to track cellphone users through records kept by their wireless providers. ""Most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most outspoken in expressing concern about an invasion of privacy. ""A cellphone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life,"" she said. But the justices did not divide along traditional lines, with both the court's liberals and conservatives expressing their reservations. Thousands of times a year, the nation's local police departments get phone company records allowing them to plot the movements of individual customers. The issue before the court Wednesday was whether access to that data should require a search warrant issued by a judge. When a cellphone is used for calls or text messages, it signals the closest antenna tower to connect with the telephone network. As the user travels, the call is handed off to successive towers, and the cellphone companies keep records of the phone numbers routed through each tower to sort out such things as roaming charges. Related: What you’re giving away with those home DNA tests Nate Wessler, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who appeared before the court, called those records ""digital bread crumbs"" and said they can be highly revealing. ""Access to these historical location records presents the government with a veritable time machine, the ability to press rewind on someone's life and learn where we've been far into the past,"" Wessler said. The case involves a challenge brought by a Michigan man, Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbing a string of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores after FBI agents used three months of cellphone records to show that he was near each store at the time of the crimes. Because the FBI did not get a search warrant, Carpenter said that evidence should be thrown out. In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that people have no privacy interest in the checks they write or the phone numbers they dial from landlines, because it's understood the information will be used to conduct business — for financial transactions or to generate phone bills. Related: 'Hey Alexa, how secure are voice-activated assistants like you?' Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court that no search warrant was needed, because cellphone customers have the same understanding, aware that the phone company will keep records of their calls, and willingly give up any claim of privacy to it. ""There is an element here of voluntariness in deciding to contract with a cell company, just like there's an element of voluntariness in getting a landline phone and making calls,"" Dreeben said. ""And there's an element of voluntariness in signing up for a bank account and using a debit card to purchase everything in your life."" But Chief Justice John Roberts questioned how voluntarily people surrender that information. ""You really don't have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone."" After listening to the 80-minute courtroom argument, many legal experts predicted the government would lose the case. ""This is probably the most significant privacy ruling the court would make for the last 10 years, because it would finally put a barrier to the government getting intimate details about people in criminal cases,"" said Mark Rasch, a former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor. In recent years, the justices have shown a willingness to extend digital-age privacy protection, ruling that police need warrants to search through the contents of smartphones or to attach a GPS tracking device to a car. The court will issue its decision by late June. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL ",Supreme Court prepared to narrow police ability to track cellphone users,0.984
335, ,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday takes up a major test of privacy rights in the digital age as it weighs whether police must obtain warrants to get data on the past locations of criminal suspects using cellphone data from wireless providers. The justices at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) are due to hear an appeal by a man named Timothy Carpenter convicted in a series of armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan with the help of past cellphone location data that linked him to the crime locations. His American Civil Liberties Union lawyers argue that without a court-issued warrant such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. Law enforcement authorities routinely request and receive this information from wireless providers during criminal investigations as they try to link a suspect to a crime. Police helped establish that Carpenter was near the scene of the robberies of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores by securing from his cellphone carrier his past “cell site location information” tracking which cellphone towers had relayed his calls. The legal fight has raised questions about the degree to which companies protect their customers’ privacy rights. The big four wireless carriers, Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, receive tens of thousands of these requests annually from law enforcement. Verizon was the only one of those four companies to tell the Supreme Court that it favors strong privacy protections for its customers, with the other three sitting on the sidelines. There is growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies amid concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and authorities evading warrant requirements. The Supreme Court twice in recent years has ruled on major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. Two years later, the court said police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest. Carpenter’s bid to suppress the evidence failed and he was convicted of six robbery counts. On appeal, the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his convictions, finding that no warrant was required for the cellphone data. The ACLU said in court papers that police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, in order to meet Fourth Amendment requirements. Based on a provision of a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act, the Justice Department said probable cause is not needed to obtain customer records. Instead, it argues, prosecutors must show only that there are “reasonable grounds” for the records to be provided and that they are “relevant and material” to an investigation. President Donald Trump’s administration said in court papers the government has a “compelling interest” in acquiring the data without a warrant because the information is particularly useful at the early stages of a criminal investigation. Civil liberties groups said the 1986 law did not anticipate the way mobile devices now contain a wealth of data on each user. A ruling is due by the end of June. ","

336, ,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"(Reuters) - A Canadian accused by the United States of helping Russian intelligence agents break into email accounts as part of a massive 2014 breach of Yahoo accounts is expected to plead guilty next week, according to court records. Karim Baratov, who earlier this year waived his right to fight a U.S. request for his extradition from Canada, is scheduled to appear in federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday for the plea hearing, according to a court calendar seen on Friday. Baratov, a 22-year-old Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, was arrested in Canada in March at the request of U.S. prosecutors. He later waived his right to fight a request for his extradition to the United States. Andrew Mancilla, Baratov’s lawyer, declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Justice Department announced charges in March  against Baratov and three other men, including two officers in Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), for their roles in the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. Prosecutors said that the FSB officers, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, directed and paid hackers to obtain information and used Alexsey Belan, who is among the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation’s most-wanted cyber criminals, to breach Yahoo. When the FSB officers learned that a target had a non-Yahoo webmail account, including through information obtained from the Yahoo hack, they worked with Baratov, who was who paid to break into at least 80 email accounts, prosecutors said. The individuals associated with the accounts they sought to access included Russian officials, the chief executive of a metals company and a prominent banker, according to the indictment. At least 50 of the accounts Baratov targeted were hosted by Google, the indictment said. Tuesday’s proceedings before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria are scheduled as a “change of plea” hearing. Baratov, the only person arrested to date in the case, previously in August pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit computer fraud, conspiring to commit access device fraud, conspiring to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.

Karim Baratov pleaded guilty to charges returned by a grand jury in the Northern District of California in February for hacking email accounts and selling the passwords to an agent of Russia’s intelligence agency, the department said in a statement. Baratov, a 22-year-old Canadian citizen born in Kazakhstan, was arrested in Canada in March at the request of U.S. prosecutors. He later waived his right to fight a request for his extradition to the United States. The Justice Department announced charges in March against Baratov and three other men, including two officers in Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, for their roles in the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. Following the charges, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the idea that FSB employees could have been involved in the Yahoo hack. Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc’s assets in June. Prosecutors said the FSB officers, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, directed and paid hackers to obtain information and used Alexsey Belan, who is among the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s most-wanted cyber criminals, to breach Yahoo.

He and his clients own shares of VZ.) Could 2018 be the year that Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) breaks out of its nearly five-year period of going nowhere? The options market is suggesting that shares of Verizon could rise almost 18% in 2018, while the technical setup would indicate that an increase over $50.50 would trigger a technical breakout. Should a technical breakout occur, the stock could rise towards $56.00 in 2018, an increase of just over 18% from the current stock price around $47.35. (For more, see also: Verizon Stock Is Ready to Break Out of Its Slump.) Over the past five years, even with the dividend, Verizon has delivered a total return of only 38%, versus an S&P 500 that has risen by nearly 86% and the S&P 500 Total Return Index, including dividends, of almost 106%. Surely the poor performance of Verizon shares have been disappointing and not worth owning over the past five years. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts Some traders are making a bet that the outlook will start improving in 2018 for the telecom giant using the call options set to expire on January 18, 2019. The strike prices ranging from $45 to $55 have a notional value of roughly $15.5 million in total open interest. This is no small bet, especially considering the time decay of the options due to the length of time. The $55 call options trade at a price of approximately $0.86, implying the price of Verizon's stock needs to rise to $55.86 just to break even. (Interactive Brokers) Due to the length of time until expiration, the options carry an expensive premium. This is because as time moves forward, the value in the options will decline, meaning the premium for the options will decrease due to time decay. It makes betting on a stock that has gone nowhere in nearly five years a risky bet to a buyer of the calls. (For related reading, see: Why Verizon May Need to Buy CBS and Viacom.) Should shares of Verizon rise above $50.50, it would trigger a technical breakout in the stock. The stock has traded in a range between $44 and $54 since 2012. However, shares have been trending lower since June of 2016. A rise above $50.50, taking the stock above that downtrend, will lead to the breakout. This would send shares higher up towards $54.50—an old resistance level. But this time around it would seem possible for shares to rise above resistance on towards the previous highs of $56. Perhaps things are looking up for Verizon in 2018, but there is a long way to go. At least for now, the technicals and the traders are suggesting shares will rise.

Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) stock dropped 9% this year, underperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain by a wide margin. The telecom giant struggled with earnings misses, its first-ever decline in core wireless subscribers, free cash flow issues, and a murky outlook for its $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo's internet business. That's why analysts expect Verizon's revenue and earnings to respectively dip 1% and 3% this year. But in fiscal 2018 (which starts in calendar 2018), Wall Street expects Verizon's revenue to rise 2%, and for its earnings to grow 3% -- solid growth rates for a stock that trades at just 12 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at what investors should expect from Verizon next year. Image source: Getty Images. In June, Verizon launched Oath, a new subsidiary that merged AOL (which it acquired in 2015) with Yahoo's internet business. Oath's portfolio includes over 50 media and technology brands, including HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, AOL.com, and TechCrunch. Oath's ecosystem reaches over a billion people per month and generated $2 billion in revenues last quarter, but Verizon hasn't fully explained how it will integrate Oath into its core wireless, wireline, and TV businesses. During last quarter's conference call, CFO Matthew Ellis stated that Verizon ""will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters"" as it integrates the business. However, one Oath strategy that was already revealed is Verizon's upcoming online TV service. Oath CEO Tim Armstrong has been assigned to integrate Oath's ad placement system (which is currently used in its network of websites) into the upcoming platform, which Verizon claims will launch in the spring. Armstrong is also responsible for fixing Go90, Verizon's mobile streaming video platform, which flopped due to competition from entrenched players like YouTube. However, both platforms still face intense competition from rival services, which include AT&T's (NYSE:T) expanding DirecTV ecosystem, Dish Networks' Sling TV, and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Xfinity X1. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner will likely force Verizon to make a comparable acquisition in the escalating battle of controlling both the pipes and the content. That's why recent reports indicate that Verizon and Comcast are both interested in buying parts of 21st Century Fox. If Verizon buys Fox's media assets, its business model could become more similar to Comcast's, which is split between its ISP business and NBCUniversal. Over the past two years, Verizon acquired Telogis and Fleetmatics to boost its presence in telematics for connected cars. It also bought drone operations company Skyward. These acquisitions are expanding Verizon's wireless reach beyond the highly saturated smartphone market. Last quarter, Verizon added 274,000 wireless phone subscribers and 91,000 tablet subscribers. However, it also added 238,000 ""other"" wireless devices, led by connections for wearables. This expansion into other devices -- which include cars and drones -- could eventually offset any declines in phone subscriptions. Earlier this year, Verizon acquired Straight Path and XO Communications to strengthen its fiber assets ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. Verizon also recently teamed up with AT&T in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon's aggressive expansion plans caused its long-term debt to hit $115.3 billion last quarter, up from $105.4 billion at the end of 2016. Just $2.2 billion of that total matures within the year, but Verizon will likely divest some non-core businesses to reduce its debt load. It's already sold data centers, its cloud businesses, and landline assets over the past two years to focus on the expansion of its digital ecosystem and 5G networks, so investors should expect additional divestments in 2018 as its spending accelerates. Verizon, like many of its telco peers, is slowly evolving. Its growth might seem glacial, but its investments in online advertising, streaming videos, and adjacent wireless markets will likely pay off over the next few years. Until that happens, investors should sit back, relax, and collect its generous forward yield of 5%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 59%. Verizon has hiked that dividend annually for ten straight years. ","
      
    What to Expect From Verizon Communications Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

The stock market has rallied under President Trump's administration: The S&P 500 has gained more than 21% since the election. As of this writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has produced 60 new closing record highs this year alone. Unfortunately, investors in telecommunications companies have not experienced any benefit, as both Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have both seen their stocks fall since the 2016 presidential election. Data by YCharts. To this point, stock-market ebullience based on politics mostly has been an exercise in faith. Trump's four-pronged business agenda of tax cuts, deregulation, Obamacare repeal, and infrastructure spending has been stymied, for the most part. Paradoxically, it appears the biggest movement on the deregulation front may aid these telecommunications giants, which have not participated in the rally. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is moving forward with a plan that could increase the profits of all internet service providers (ISPs), and give a boost to dividend giants like Verizon and AT&T. Image Source: Getty Images In 2015, Obama-era FCC chairman Tom Wheeler designated ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the telecommunications act after earlier attempts to apply net neutrality were stymied by the courts. When new FCC chair Ajit Pai assumed leadership, he immediately called the regulations ""heavy handed"" and promised to undo the classification. This month, Pai outlined his repeal plan, the ""Restoring Internet Freedom"" order; it's expected to pass next month. Not satisfied with a simple repeal, Pai appears to have gone even further. The FCC also announced its intent for federal pre-emption, blocking states that want to enforce their own regulations from doing so, and agreeing with AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast, which all lobbied for federal restrictions on state-level regulators. With one move, Pai essentially guaranteed that net-neutrality rules never would be applied to ISPs in the United States. AT&T and Verizon could use the help: Both are facing diminishing prospects in other business lines. Wireline telephony continues to suffer as wireless has become the de facto communication method. Recently, wireless telephony has seen profit stagnate under pricing pressures from T-Mobile and Sprint via unlimited data plans. Subscription TV has also been under pressure due to streaming-based substitutes and cord-cutters. The only true growth area has been ISP. Meanwhile, both AT&T and Verizon have large needs for cash. In addition to the need to pay to maintain and upgrade the networks listed above, both have large commitments to financial stakeholders. Between bondholders, dividend payouts, and capital expenditures, Verizon paid $31.6 billion in the last 12 months, while AT&T paid $40.5 billion. While free cash flow is currently supportive of both companies' dividends, the combination of large cash payouts, declining prospects in most business lines, and higher interest rates in the future has led to concerns about each company's ability to continue servicing its dividends in future years. Many ISPs shocked observers when they noted they agreed with the broad tenets of net neutrality. Comcast even crafted a heavily trafficked blog post addressing the subject -- while speaking out against Title II designation. Critics counter that Comcast has broken promises to regulators before, and it's different when profit is concerned. In fact, as CEOs have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, it's almost a dereliction of their duty to not at least look into fully monetizing their assets. Net neutrality made their ability to monetize their Internet assets more difficult. Once it's repealed, the companies are legally free to block, meter, or slow traffic as they wish, with potential losers being everybody that depends on content delivered on the internet. Not to take full advantage of this is doing a disservice to their shareholders. Whether or not ISPs will do so is anybody's guess for the time being. It appears, however, that the executive branch of the federal government no longer considers this an issue worthy of regulation. ","
      
    Will the Federal Government Give Verizon and AT&T a Dividend Boost? -- The Motley Fool

If you're an income-focused investor, no doubt Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have popped up on your radar. While the broader S&P 500 has a dividend yield of 1.9% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond of 2.3%, Verizon and AT&T yield 5.3% and 5.8%, respectively. It's not just high dividend yields. Shares of AT&T and Verizon currently trade for forward price-to-earnings ratios of 11.4 and 11.7, respectively, versus the S&P 500's 21 forward multiple. It's clear Wall Street doesn't have high expectations for these companies. As of this writing, year to date, shares of Verizon and AT&T have lost 15% and 19%, respectively, while the overall market has advanced by 16%. You must ask if these companies are good yield plays that will continue paying their dividend for years to come or if they're yield traps -- companies that lure investors in with high yields only to cut them or substantially underperform the market. Image source: Getty Images. At the heart of AT&T and Verizon's issues are problems with their core business of wireless communications. While Big Red and AT&T are the two largest carriers in the United States by subscriber count, the business is becoming highly competitive. Led by T-Mobile's Uncarrier program, the industry has endured lower prices and more consumer-friendly terms, at the same time requiring huge capital expenditures to build out and maintain the network. Both are also in the subscription-based television industry, with Verizon's FiOS offering and AT&T's purchase of DIRECTV. The subscription television business faces many of the same issues that affect wireless communications, including high capital expenditure requirements in a competitive market. In addition, the subscription television market is facing competition in the form of streaming-based substitutes and from a shift in consumer behavior as more ""cut the cord"" and forgo the service entirely. Verizon Communications can be partially absolved for its high debt sins. In 2013, the company engaged in the largest corporate debt offering ever, selling $49 billion. The company was forced to do so to buy its most lucrative business, Verizon Wireless. In 1999, before anyone had an idea just how important the wireless industry would become, Verizon (then GTE and Bell Atlantic) announced a joint venture with Vodafone to create a wireless company, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone owning 45%. By the time Verizon was able to repurchase Vodafone's minority stake, it was worth $130 billion, forcing the company to take on large sums of debt to fully own its namesake wireless business. However, Verizon could not have had worse timing, as T-Mobile's Uncarrier program began in earnest shortly after the deal closed, eventually forcing Verizon to reoffer unlimited (and margin-lowering) data plans. AT&T has also been active in the debt markets, selling $17.5 billion -- the then third-largest offering -- to buy DIRECTV. AT&T is also looking to take on $40 billion in more debt as it hopes to buy Time Warner. The combined company is expected to have $175 billion of total debt on its books. As of now, the federal government is challenging the merger, which may be good news for investors concerned about the company's balance sheet. Verizon is committed to defending its dividend. At a September Goldman Sachs conference, CEO Lowell McAdam noted that the company has a target of $10 billion in cost savings over the next four years to pay the dividend through 2022. This was less than a week after the company raised its dividend for the 11th year in a row. Not to be outdone, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson remarked at the same conference: Our owners expect the cash return, the dividend return, and we are committed to that. We've been a public company for over 30 years. We've increased that dividend every single year. And so, we are committed to the dividend. We think that's very, very important. But then the third use of cash obviously will be the debt pay down. So those are kind of the priorities that I think through the next three years. Currently, both AT&T and Verizon are generating enough cash to pay their dividends. Over the past five fiscal years, AT&T produced enough free cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures) to pay its dividend; Verizon did so in four of the five. However, with financial leverage ratios of 3.5 and 9.5, respectively, free cash flow can rapidly swing negative with small decreases in revenue or operating margins. While I wouldn't go as far as calling either AT&T nor Verizon yield traps, I do think both are reasonably priced considering their high debt piles, large payout commitments, and huge capital expenditures. Even if these companies don't cut their dividend, I predict dividend raises will come less frequently or on a much smaller incremental basis. ","
      
    Are Verizon and AT&T Dividend Yield Plays or Yield Traps? -- The Motley Fool

346,"Jeremy Bowman, Danny Vena, and Daniel Miller",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's no surprise that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of the most popular dividend stocks on the market. The telecom giant is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrials, and hails from a defensive sector, well-known for paying generous dividends and weathering recessions. With a 5.3% dividend yield, Verizon's payout is nothing to sneer at, but investors can find better yields elsewhere if they know where to look. Below, three of our analysts explain why think Imperial Brands (NASDAQOTH:IMBBY), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and AT&T (NYSE:T) may be better choices for dividend investors. Image source: Getty Images. Daniel Miller (Imperial Brands): Owning shares of a company such as Imperial Brands, one of the world's largest tobacco players, can generate serious income for investors even if you don't use or endorse their products. While its quarterly payments vary, as you can see here, its yield of 5.81% is certainly enticing. For Americans it's easy to be bearish on tobacco companies as the number of U.S. adults smoking continues to decline, but there is plenty of global growth remaining. Imperial has exposure to some of the biggest and most lucrative markets in the world, and a couple advantages. One is that Imperial Brands is the leader in Cuban cigars, which could be a boost to its financials as relations between the U.S. and Cuba slowly improve. Another benefit has been the progress of plain-packaging legislation in countries around the world. The goal of these laws is to require tobacco packaging to be uniform in color and presentation, without branding, logos, or other promotional elements. While plain packaging will reduce demand, as intended, Imperial is known for its value brands and wouldn't suffer as much as larger competitors powered by more recognizable brands. Finding a company dishing out a dividend yield higher than Verizon isn't easy. However, Imperial Brands offers a solid dividend with global growth prospects, potential catalysts, and competitive advantages that make it worth considering when looking for income stocks. Danny Vena (Iron Mountain): Iron Mountain may not be a household name like Verizon, but the company is the global leader in records storage and information management solutions. It occupies more than 85 million square feet of space in the 1,400 facilities it operates, in 53 countries around the world. The company counts 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies as clients, and has a total of 230,000 organizations as customers worldwide. Those customers tend to stick around. A full 50% of the boxes Iron Mountain stored 15 years ago are still stored today. Iron Mountain operates as a real-estate investment trust (REIT), which requires it to pay out at least 90% of its profits as dividends. This results in an above-average payout, as the company currently sports a 5.8% dividend yield, for a higher income stream than even Verizon. Iron Mountain expects to grow its dividend from $2.20 per share in 2017 to $2.54 per share by 2020. The company plans to fund that dividend by growing its revenue by 5% annually over the next three years, and its adjusted funds from operations by 9% annually through 2020, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Iron Mountain will continue its strong history of buyouts, which it expects will fuel growth, with an estimated $450 million to $600 million in acquisitions anticipated between 2018 and 2020. The company will then apply a proven template of cost-cutting and margin improvement. With a 25-year history of revenue growth and strong dividends, this company is king of the mountain. Jeremy Bowman (AT&T): Verizon isn't the only juicy dividend play in the telecom sector. Rival AT&T is also generous when it comes to sharing the wealth with investors, and is a better dividend pick than Verizon for a number of reasons. AT&T offers a higher yield, at 5.6%, and unlike Verizon, Ma Bell is a Dividend Aristocrat, as it's paid increasing dividends for the last 33 years. By comparison, Verizon paused its dividend hikes for much of the first decade of the century. AT&T's dividend hikes have been modest over the last several years; the payout has increased by just a penny each year, or a little more than 2%, as the company's profit growth, like Verizon's, has been modest. AT&T has also pursued acquisitions more aggressively than Verizon, which could better position it as the telecom and media industries continue to consolidate. In 2015, AT&T closed on a $49 billion takeover of DIRECTV, the leader in satellite TV, and the company is now hoping to merge with Time Warner, though that deal will need to pass regulatory muster first. Since Time Warner and AT&T aren't direct competitors, many expect some version of the deal to eventually go through. Elsewhere, AT&T is narrowing the gap with Verizon in network quality, and would have a much stronger bundle if even part of the Time Warner deal is approved. With a higher dividend yield and a strong record of dividend hikes, AT&T looks like the better choice for dividend investors. ","
      
    3 Dividend Stocks That Pay You Better Than Verizon Does -- The Motley Fool

347,Daniel B. Kline,11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR), it has become a question of when, not if, the company runs out of money. The internet, phone, and cable provider has been steadily sinking since it spent $10.5 billion on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline businesses in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That deal was an attempt by the company to gain the scale it needed to compete with its bigger rivals. The problem is that Frontier's purchase has coincided with a general decline in the cable business as cord cutting accelerated. Making matters worse is that telco or wireline providers have not been compensating for their pay-television losses with broadband gains. Frontier has been steadily losing video customers. Image source: Getty Images. Since its Verizon deal closed in April 2016, Frontier has lost subscribers in every quarter. These losses have been in both cable and internet, and they show no signs of stopping -- nor even slowing down. Frontier made the CTF purchase in order to give it the size it needed to operate efficiently -- and in that respect, the deal delivered; the company has slashed its operating costs by over $1 billion annually, and more savings are expected. The problem is the steady decline in subscribers. That has left the company in a cash crunch, which it has met partly by creatively restructuring debt and partly by slashing its dividend. Frontier's fiscal woes also sank its share price so low it was forced to engage in a reverse stock split to avoid being delisted. On the positive side, Frontier has slowed its losses in both customer count and dollars. CEO Daniel McCarthy celebrated that in the company's third-quarter earnings release. ""Our third quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" he said. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas and Florida markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" Data source: Frontier. *There was a one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. It does look as though the numbers are improving, but Frontier is fighting two negative trends. Cord cutting has sped up, with major pay-TV providers losing a total of around 1.4 million paying customers through the first three quarters of 2017, after dropping 795,000 in all of 2016. Second, as noted above, while broadband has been growing, that growth has gone to cable providers, not telephone companies, which is the technology Frontier uses. McCarthy may manage to hold off the end. He has proven adept when it comes to cutting costs and managing obligations. It's even possible that there is a bottom for cord cutting, and that perhaps Frontier may stabilize. The problem is that the company can't grow. A stable Frontier may find some companies willing to acquire it, but not at much of a premium, if any. This isn't a potential growth stock: It's a survival play. McCarthy may deliver survival -- and that's certainly better than bankruptcy -- but he can't change the nature of this market, and that puts a pretty hard cap on Frontier's upside. ","

348,Adam Levy,11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When it seemed like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) were on course for a successful merger agreement last month, I wrote that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) would be two of the biggest beneficiaries if a deal went through. Fewer competitors means more profits to go around for the players that remain. But with Sprint's dwindling hopes of a buyer swooping in and snatching it up, it may be forced to refocus on its bottom line instead of attracting new customers at any cost. A shift in focus would benefit competing carriers, including its former suitor, T-Mobile. That's the crux of the argument posed by analyst Craig Moffett, who writes, ""All players will benefit if Sprint, as seems likely, adopts a less promotional pricing posture as they attempt to balance the competing priorities of debt service and network reinvestment."" Indeed, there's no longer a clear buyer for Sprint, and the company is being forced to become self-sustaining. Sprint could struggle to differentiate its product and attract new subscribers without its extremely low pricing. That leaves more subscribers on the table for T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. Image source: Sprint. Sprint has run several major price promotions over the last couple years. To its credit, the promotions have done a good job of winning new customers from competitors, but it hasn't helped grow the top line. Over the last two years, Sprint has added nearly 1.7 million postpaid phone subscribers and 1.1 million total postpaid connections. Its prepaid and wholesale and affiliate connections, meanwhile, have fallen considerably. Overall, service revenue fell from $6.9 billion in the second quarter in 2015 to just under $6 billion last quarter. While Sprint is attracting more customers, it's not able to hold onto them. Its postpaid subscriber churn rate climbed from 1.54% in the second quarter of 2015 to 1.72% last quarter. That churn rate is significantly higher than all three of its main competitors. That may be due to customers falling off Sprint's promotional pricing. All this is to say: Sprint is attracting more and more gross additions thanks to its pricing promotion. But those gross customers are largely coming from competitors. If Sprint offers fewer price promotions, it should see churn rate continue to climb for several quarters while gross additions decline. That means net additions at competitors should climb in aggregate. If Sprint is forced to reduce its promotional offers, it seems like Verizon and T-Mobile are likely to benefit the most. AT&T is weighed down by its pay-TV business and loads of debt, while Verizon's wireline business is considerably smaller, and T-Mobile is purely a wireless service provider. Moffett offers a similar conclusion. All three offer slightly differentiated services. Verizon's differentiation strategy of maintaining its premium network quality and its strong brand provide it one of the better competitive advantages in the industry. AT&T is leveraging its wireline assets to bundle high-value customers, and T-Mobile is working to provide a more customer-friendly service. T-Mobile has managed to win most net additions in recent years, but Verizon is starting to show signs of life after introducing its unlimited plan at the beginning of the year. AT&T, meanwhile, continues to struggle to attract new customers. Look for that trend to continue, and the gap between AT&T and its competitors could grow even wider if Sprint slows on the promotions. Sprint isn't planning to give up competing on price. But its recent vow to beat any competitor's price on new devices like the iPhone X is much less aggressive than in years past when it was more active in slashing prices. Sprint's new policy allows competitors to be less aggressive in their promotions, a factor we've already seen play out this year. As Sprint refocuses on the bottom line, it's good news for everyone in the industry, but especially T-Mobile and Verizon. ","

349,"Anders Bylund, Chris Neiger, and Jordan Wathen",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's nothing quite like a good, solid oil dividend, right? Anyone looking for a strong dividend payout backed by torrential cash flows must surely be impressed by ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield and 34 years of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Exxon is indeed a great income stock, but there are many dividend stocks out there that offer even better policies than the oil giant. You don't even have to stick within the energy market. A panel of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool has put together a handful of stocks with better yields than ExxonMobil. Read on to see how Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) can beat the big oil stocks from the perspective of a dividend hunter. You can do better than Exxon. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Spirit Realty Capital): Shares of this retail-focused REIT are too cheap to ignore. Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

350,"Chris Neiger, George Budwell, and Neha Chamaria",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Chevron Corporation should be at the top of any dividend investor's short list right now, considering that it pays its investors an enviable 3.7% yield. But as good as that is, the oil and gas company isn't the only stock that's pushing the boundaries of dividend yields. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), and AT&T (NYSE:T) all cut bigger checks than Chevron, and each have a compelling reason for dividend investors to give them serious consideration. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. George Budwell (GlaxoSmithKline): With a current yield of 5.75%, British pharma stalwart GlaxoSmithKline easily offers one of the richest payouts within its large-cap peer group. And Glaxo's sky-high yield even exceeds that of that the dividend aristocrat Chevron at present. Glaxo's monstrous yield does come with a big catch, though. The pharma titan's high yield, after all, directly stems from the company's inability to restock its aging product portfolio with new high-value growth products -- especially in the pharmaceutical space, where its top-selling asthma medication, Advair, has been gradually on decline for some time now. As a result, Glaxo's shares have now shed nearly a quarter of their value over the past three years, and this downward trend has only been accelerating heading into 2018. In fact, Glaxo's recent talk of doling out up to $10 billion for Pfizer's consumer healthcare unit stoked fears among investors that the drugmaker may be forced to suspend its top flight dividend altogether. The good news is that Glaxo does have a number of green shoots, so to speak, on the pharma and vaccine sides of its business that could save its dividend, and perhaps usher in a new era of strong top-line growth. As a prime example, the company just grabbed a key regulatory approval for its two-drug HIV therapy known as Juluca that appears primed to be a big winner from a sales standpoint. And its newly approved shingles vaccine, Shingrix, should also eventually achieve blockbuster status as well. All told, Glaxo's rather enticing dividend could indeed evaporate if the company's newly installed management does expand deeper into the consumer healthcare space. But there are some compelling reasons to believe this exceptional yield may be spared from the chopping block as well. Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Infrastructure Partners): As a Dividend Aristocrat, Chevron's popularity among income investors isn't unwarranted. However, there are other stocks that are not only cutting higher yields than Chevron but also giving income investors encouraging dividend goals to look forward to. Consider Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, an asset managing company that acquires high-quality, distressed assets across key sectors like utilities, transport, energy, and communications, and turns them around profitably. Now, Brookfield doesn't boast a dividend track record like Chevron since the company was established as late as 2008. Brookfield's dividend yield of 4% is also only slightly higher than that of Chevron's, but you just have to see the following chart to understand how the stock has trumped the oil giant in the past decade, thanks to its rapidly growing dividends. Image source: YCharts. Brookfield has done a tremendous job in the past decade, growing its funds from operations more than ten-fold. I consider Brookfield a gold mine for income investors: It has grown its dividends at a compounded average rate of 12% since 2009 and has a long-term goal of 5% to 9% annual dividend growth. It's difficult to get such visibility from Chevron's dividends. That means as a Brookfield shareholder, you can not only expect high dividend yields of around 4%, but also watch your dividends grow year after year. When you factor in the relative resilience of its business compared to Chevron's, Brookfield's dividend checks could easily be much bigger in the long run. Chris Neiger (AT&T): Dividend investors should be absolutely in love with AT&T's 5.5% dividend yield, not to mention the fact that the company has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The telecom gian has built out a connectivity empire that includes its core wireless business, DirectTV services, and its wireline services that all brought in a total of $39.7 billion in the third quarter 2017. AT&T has managed to keep pace with wireless rival Verizon and hold its own as the nation's second-largest carrier. AT&T is also looking ahead to the coming demand for 5G wireless; it has already conducted tests of the technology and plans on launching a commercial 5G network by 2020 or 2021. AT&T has more opportunities outside of wireless as well. The company's $108 billion bid for Time Warner would give the company HBO, CNN, and all of Warner Bros.'s content -- and allow AT&T to keep pace with Verizon as it focuses its attention on more content offerings as well. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is fighting that deal right now on concerns that AT&T could have too much pricing power when it controls bundled content and how that content is delivered to customers. But even if the DOJ ends up stopping AT&T's purchase of Time Warner (or restricts part of the deal), the carrier is already so firmly established in its wireless business and its other home connectivity services that investors have little to worry about. The company's current wireless position and future opportunities in 5G, as well as its expanding customer base with DirecTV (it added 300,000 net customer additions in the third quarter), should be enough for investors to give AT&T strong consideration. Add to all of that the fact that AT&T's shares are trading at less than 12 times the company's forward earnings, and AT&T looks like a solid bet for dividend investors -- and with an enviable yield to boot.

When news broke that Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) (NASDAQ:FOX) was in discussions with Disney (NYSE:DIS) to part with its valuable movie and TV properties, along with certain cable channels and overseas businesses, the entire entertainment industry jumped to attention. A full transcript follows the video. Vincent Shen: Our next topic is actually pretty similar in that it revolves around the potential acquisition of media assets. In this case, it's from 21st Century Fox. There have already been several weeks of talks or interest reported from companies like Walt Disney, Comcast, Verizon and Sony. Dan, can you tell us more about what parts of the business Fox might be looking to part with, and what the various suitors seem most interested in acquiring? Shen: We'll first focus on Disney, because they were reported as being the initial party to approach Fox regarding these deal discussions. There's a lot to like in terms of what Disney can get out of this deal. As you mentioned, the film and television studios, plus some of those cable networks, that will definitely bolster Disney's own media networks and their own studio businesses. Kline: Absolutely. Hulu is also rolling out its live TV streaming, which for Disney, which is losing homes with ESPN, ABC and all its cable networks, controlling Hulu and being able to make its own channel as a key part of that live streaming package would also be another plum. Shen: Yeah. The last thing I want to speak to is some of the international assets. There's a 39% stake in Sky that Fox currently holds. Sky is currently based in the U.K. It's the largest pay-TV player in Europe. Fox actually has a $15 billion bid right now to acquire the remaining stake of Sky. I believe, right now, that's in a bit of a regulatory mire. The prospects of that coming out with an approval are basically going down by the day. Kline: And some of that is due to Fox itself. So there might be a better chance of Disney making that deal if they want to. Shen: And some of the history between those entities, absolutely. Then, there's also control of Star India, for example. This is media company in India that would be another asset I think would really help Disney expand its international reach. Those are two properties that I think Comcast would also very much be interested in in terms of expanding some of its international business. Shen: I do want to focus in on 21st Century Fox's business, give listeners an idea of the revenue breakdown. For the cable network's business, about $16 billion, or 56% of their top line. Film studios coming in at $8 billion, or about 30% of the top line. Then, their broadcast TV, which would not be included in the asset sales that are being discussed here, about $5.6 billion in the most recent fiscal year. The company currently has a market cap of $55 billion. So even a partial buyout would be a huge deal in the media and entertainment industry. I think the acquiring company is ultimately going to face some regulatory issues here similar to what we talked about in the last segment on  AT&T and Time Warner, in that any way you cut it, whoever the acquiring company ends up being, there are assets and properties that will compete directly with either the content-focused rivals like Disney, or on the distribution side with Comcast. So there's some of that to consider, as well. Kline: I think the reality is, any of the three potential suitors would be willing to sell off FX if it meant they could have access. This is really an intellectual property deal. Everything else is icing on the cake, it's gravy, it's wonderful. But if you are Disney or Comcast, you're looking at your theme parks, you're looking at your movie studio, your ability to fill in these streaming services, and that's what they would be buying. All of these other things -- if Disney bought this, yes, they want distribution in Europe. They have, obviously, animated films and other things that travel the globe. Marvel characters are globally dominant. But if they had to sell the stake in Sky to make this happen, I don't think that's an impediment. I think this would be a relatively easy negotiation, in terms of, ""There are some regulatory concerns here."" Shen: Yeah. The only thing I would say now with negotiation is, there's no deal on the table yet, no official price tag that I've been able to find anywhere. But if Fox ultimately comes to an agreement with one of its suitors, definitely get a better price with the various companies now circling and expressing interest in the assets. The early talks with Disney stalled, because they couldn't agree on terms. And with a potential bidding war among interested parties, I think Fox will definitely come out with a more favorable deal than it would have otherwise. My last point, if we can step back a little bit and take a 10,000 foot few of not only this Fox news but the AT&T-Time Warner deal, I think consolidation among the content creators and distributors in this industry is likely to continue as they try and diversify their businesses and get a little bit more leverage to compete and build these big portfolio-style companies. Netflix ultimately has thrown the industry through a loop. They started with DVD mailers, now they've evolved into a streaming service and a powerhouse with dozens of original movies and TV series. So companies like Disney and Comcast are grappling with cord-cutting, they're seeing weaker growth and hits to their bottom line with customers changing how they consume entertainment. I think this model of combining distribution with the creation, in terms of the content, I think it's only going to become more prevalent barring some type of regulatory interference. ","

The 31-year-old, who created the microblogging platform in 2007, announced his departure Monday in an e-mail sent to Tumblr staff, which he later shared on his blog and Twitter account. “I’ve decided that 2017 will be my last year at Tumblr,” Karp said in the memo, adding, “My decision comes after months of reflection on my personal ambitions.” Tumblr is part of the Verizon-owned media conglomerate Oath Inc. Tumblr was purchased for about $1 billion by Yahoo Inc. in 2013, but Yahoo later wrote down the blogging site’s value by more than half.

354, ,11302017,MarketWatch,11232017,"A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed prepared Wednesday to impose new limits on the government's ability to track cellphone users through records kept by their wireless providers. ""Most Americans, I still think, want to avoid Big Brother,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most outspoken in expressing concern about an invasion of privacy. ""A cellphone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life,"" she said. But the justices did not divide along traditional lines, with both the court's liberals and conservatives expressing their reservations. Thousands of times a year, the nation's local police departments get phone company records allowing them to plot the movements of individual customers. The issue before the court Wednesday was whether access to that data should require a search warrant issued by a judge. When a cellphone is used for calls or text messages, it signals the closest antenna tower to connect with the telephone network. As the user travels, the call is handed off to successive towers, and the cellphone companies keep records of the phone numbers routed through each tower to sort out such things as roaming charges. Related: What you’re giving away with those home DNA tests Nate Wessler, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who appeared before the court, called those records ""digital bread crumbs"" and said they can be highly revealing. ""Access to these historical location records presents the government with a veritable time machine, the ability to press rewind on someone's life and learn where we've been far into the past,"" Wessler said. The case involves a challenge brought by a Michigan man, Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of robbing a string of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores after FBI agents used three months of cellphone records to show that he was near each store at the time of the crimes. Because the FBI did not get a search warrant, Carpenter said that evidence should be thrown out. In past cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that people have no privacy interest in the checks they write or the phone numbers they dial from landlines, because it's understood the information will be used to conduct business — for financial transactions or to generate phone bills. Related: 'Hey Alexa, how secure are voice-activated assistants like you?' Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court that no search warrant was needed, because cellphone customers have the same understanding, aware that the phone company will keep records of their calls, and willingly give up any claim of privacy to it. ""There is an element here of voluntariness in deciding to contract with a cell company, just like there's an element of voluntariness in getting a landline phone and making calls,"" Dreeben said. ""And there's an element of voluntariness in signing up for a bank account and using a debit card to purchase everything in your life."" But Chief Justice John Roberts questioned how voluntarily people surrender that information. ""You really don't have a choice these days if you want to have a cellphone."" After listening to the 80-minute courtroom argument, many legal experts predicted the government would lose the case. ""This is probably the most significant privacy ruling the court would make for the last 10 years, because it would finally put a barrier to the government getting intimate details about people in criminal cases,"" said Mark Rasch, a former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor. In recent years, the justices have shown a willingness to extend digital-age privacy protection, ruling that police need warrants to search through the contents of smartphones or to attach a GPS tracking device to a car. The court will issue its decision by late June. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL ",Supreme Court prepared to narrow police ability to track cellphone users,0.984

358, ,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposal driven by President Donald Trump to overhaul the country’s tax system is moving through U.S. Congress, lifting the overall stock market and raising hopes that corporate earnings will get a boost. The S&P 500 .SPX rallied this week as the drive to push sweeping tax legislation through the U.S. Senate gained momentum, although gains were tempered by a report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that before taking office Trump had directed him to make contact with Russians. Senate Republicans said on Friday they had gathered the votes needed to pass a sweeping tax overhaul. While negotiations are ongoing, the legislation could cut the corporate tax rate to as low as 20 percent from 35 percent. UBS strategists project that overall S&P 500 earnings would rise by 6.5 percent should the corporate tax rate fall to 25 percent and increase by 9.5 percent should the rate go to 20 percent. But certain stocks could benefit more than others from the Republican-led plans. “It will be favorable to companies with primarily domestic business that are paying close to the full tax rate,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. Investors appear to have already rotated into some of these tax-sensitive areas. Some market watchers caution about generalizing winners, noting big differences in effective rates between companies in the same sectors. But strategists point to industries with a concentration of companies poised to benefit, particularly from a lower corporate tax rate. (For a graphic on industries that stand to win from corporate tax cuts, click reut.rs/2zVJls9) (For a graphic on sector benefits from a corporate tax cut, click reut.rs/2AMn9AU) (High tax stocks underperform in 2017: reut.rs/2AMdrP5) Of the major S&P sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of historical tax rates. Brian Klock, managing director in equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who covers large regional banks, expects tax cuts to add 16 percent to median bank earnings in 2018 and 18 percent in 2019. “We’re assuming whatever the benefit is will drop right to the bottom line,” Klock said. “They won’t give up on loan pricing or put any big investments in. With the increased capital they’ll return it to shareholders.” Transportation ranks among the top industries expected to receive a big earnings boost from a lower corporate tax rate, according to UBS. Railroads would benefit from provisions allowing them to expense their capital expenditures in one year as opposed to over time, lowering their taxable income, Schoonmaker said. “We’ll see what comes out as far as the ability to depreciate immediately, but that certainly would be beneficial because they are all big capital spenders,” Schoonmaker said, noting that railroads spend 18 percent to 20 percent of revenue on capital expenditures. Domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services would likely benefit more from tax rate reductions than pharmaceutical and medical device companies that sell their products overseas. “Healthcare services is one of the most taxed industries and would be a big beneficiary of reductions in corporate tax rates,” Lance Wilkes, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a recent note. According to Leerink analyst Ana Gupte, a corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent could boost health insurer earnings by about 20 percent to 40 percent, but some of those gains would be expected to be passed through to employer and individual customers. Department stores head the list of retailers that will benefit because they have among the heaviest U.S. exposure, said Bridget Weishaar, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. “Retail companies will benefit from paying a lower tax rate,” Weishaar said. “Consumers hopefully will have additional cash, which will help consumer discretionary spending.” “They’re domestically focused companies with a very high percentage of their employee base in the U.S. and significant amounts of investments in U.S. infrastructure,” said Amir Rozwadowski, telecom equity analyst at Barclays. “Therefore they’re predisposed to benefit from tax reform.” AT&T has climbed 4.9 percent this week, while Verizon has surged 9 percent.

Fisher, CEO of MBF Clearing, launched the ""Essential 40"" index earlier this year,  an index that includes Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Visa and UnitedHealth, among others. KKM Financial launched a mutual fund on Monday, the Essential 40 Stock Fund (ESSIX), which tracks the index. ""It's today's version of the Dow Jones,"" Fisher told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday. ""It's the 40 most essential names to the way you live."" ""Without these names your life is blank,"" he said jokingly. Below is a chart of the 40 stocks in the Essential 40 index and how they have performed in 2017: Throughout its history, the Dow has been the go-to benchmark of the U.S. stock market for Main Street market watchers. The biggest difference between the Dow and Fisher's Essential 40 index — aside from the number of stocks in them and how long they've been around — is how they are weighted. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with a higher price will have a bigger sway on the index's overall direction. Stocks in the Essential 40 index, meanwhile, all have a 2.5 percent weight on the index. Fisher is one of the most wildly followed commodities traders on Wall Street, being known for making calls on oil and energy. He has also worked with the likes of legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Oil prices are up about 7 percent in 2017, following a year where they shot up 45 percent. But at current levels, Fisher thinks crude is ""trapped."" ""I think the upside is limited to $60-$63 and the downside is capped around the high $40s,"" he said. ""I think that, if we go up much more, what will happen is you'll see a lot more rigs come online."" Fisher also said that a lot of people in OPEC and Russia are comfortable with crude trading at these levels. U.S. oil gained 0.37 percent to trade at $57.68 per barrel on Tuesday.

Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) stock dropped 9% this year, underperforming the S&P 500's 17% gain by a wide margin. The telecom giant struggled with earnings misses, its first-ever decline in core wireless subscribers, free cash flow issues, and a murky outlook for its $4.5 billion acquisition of Yahoo's internet business. That's why analysts expect Verizon's revenue and earnings to respectively dip 1% and 3% this year. But in fiscal 2018 (which starts in calendar 2018), Wall Street expects Verizon's revenue to rise 2%, and for its earnings to grow 3% -- solid growth rates for a stock that trades at just 12 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at what investors should expect from Verizon next year. Image source: Getty Images. In June, Verizon launched Oath, a new subsidiary that merged AOL (which it acquired in 2015) with Yahoo's internet business. Oath's portfolio includes over 50 media and technology brands, including HuffPost, Yahoo Sports, AOL.com, and TechCrunch. Oath's ecosystem reaches over a billion people per month and generated $2 billion in revenues last quarter, but Verizon hasn't fully explained how it will integrate Oath into its core wireless, wireline, and TV businesses. During last quarter's conference call, CFO Matthew Ellis stated that Verizon ""will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters"" as it integrates the business. However, one Oath strategy that was already revealed is Verizon's upcoming online TV service. Oath CEO Tim Armstrong has been assigned to integrate Oath's ad placement system (which is currently used in its network of websites) into the upcoming platform, which Verizon claims will launch in the spring. Armstrong is also responsible for fixing Go90, Verizon's mobile streaming video platform, which flopped due to competition from entrenched players like YouTube. However, both platforms still face intense competition from rival services, which include AT&T's (NYSE:T) expanding DirecTV ecosystem, Dish Networks' Sling TV, and Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Xfinity X1. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T's planned purchase of Time Warner will likely force Verizon to make a comparable acquisition in the escalating battle of controlling both the pipes and the content. That's why recent reports indicate that Verizon and Comcast are both interested in buying parts of 21st Century Fox. If Verizon buys Fox's media assets, its business model could become more similar to Comcast's, which is split between its ISP business and NBCUniversal. Over the past two years, Verizon acquired Telogis and Fleetmatics to boost its presence in telematics for connected cars. It also bought drone operations company Skyward. These acquisitions are expanding Verizon's wireless reach beyond the highly saturated smartphone market. Last quarter, Verizon added 274,000 wireless phone subscribers and 91,000 tablet subscribers. However, it also added 238,000 ""other"" wireless devices, led by connections for wearables. This expansion into other devices -- which include cars and drones -- could eventually offset any declines in phone subscriptions. Earlier this year, Verizon acquired Straight Path and XO Communications to strengthen its fiber assets ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. Verizon also recently teamed up with AT&T in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon's aggressive expansion plans caused its long-term debt to hit $115.3 billion last quarter, up from $105.4 billion at the end of 2016. Just $2.2 billion of that total matures within the year, but Verizon will likely divest some non-core businesses to reduce its debt load. It's already sold data centers, its cloud businesses, and landline assets over the past two years to focus on the expansion of its digital ecosystem and 5G networks, so investors should expect additional divestments in 2018 as its spending accelerates. Verizon, like many of its telco peers, is slowly evolving. Its growth might seem glacial, but its investments in online advertising, streaming videos, and adjacent wireless markets will likely pay off over the next few years. Until that happens, investors should sit back, relax, and collect its generous forward yield of 5%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 59%. Verizon has hiked that dividend annually for ten straight years. ","
      
    What to Expect From Verizon Communications Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

363,Adam Levy,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The U.S. wireless industry is dominated by AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The two telecom giants account for about 70% of wireless customers and an even larger share of industry profits. But with pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint in the recent past, both have struggled to grow revenue. Still, investors looking to get into the telecom space may be attracted to AT&T and Verizon due to their scale and dividends. But which stock makes a better buy: AT&T or Verizon? Image source: Getty Images/ Since acquiring DIRECTV, AT&T became one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the country on top of its dominant status in the wireless industry. Now, it's trying to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), which would further expand the company both horizontally and vertically. But both the wireless and pay-TV businesses are bleeding thousands of their most valuable subscribers every quarter. Last quarter, AT&T lost 97,000 postpaid phone subscribers and 89,000 video subscribers, including 385,000 DIRECTV satellite and U-Verse subscribers. Both the mobility and the entertainment segments showed year-over-year declines in revenue. AT&T has aimed to boost its wireless service margin by cutting costs. Pricing pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint, however, has resulted in steadily declining revenue per user. AT&T has been most aggressive in bundling its wireless service with its pay-TV service in order to offset the pressure from lower-priced competitors. Still, it's losing subscribers and sacrificing margin on its pay-TV business. The Time Warner deal would provide AT&T with yet another avenue to generate revenue, but there's not much for AT&T to gain from the deal. Perhaps its content expense and its existing ""HBO for life"" promotion costs would decline a bit, but the economics don't make sense to limit any Time Warner content to AT&T's distribution channels. Meanwhile, the deal would simply add to AT&T's ballooning debt load. Verizon has also struggled to grow its business. Wireless service revenue declined 11 straight quarters before finally making a sequential improvement last quarter. Total operating revenue for the wireless segment continues to fall year over year every quarter. Likewise, average revenue per account is falling despite an increasing number of connections per account. Verizon's wireline business is performing somewhat better than AT&T's, maintaining its revenue and TV and internet subscriber bases. Margins for the business are also improving, as Verizon has sold off its underperforming assets in the segment. Overall, Verizon's business looks in much better shape than AT&T's. It's starting to add new postpaid phone subscribers again, following the introduction of its unlimited plan. Its service revenue is starting to climb again, which should lead to year-over-year revenue growth in 2018. And it's not bogged down by a giant, lower-margin, struggling pay-TV business. AT&T and Verizon both trade for similar valuations. AT&T's enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.6 is just below Verizon's 6.8. That's not a big enough discount on its own to consider AT&T over Verizon considering the broader risk the company faces with its massive pay-TV segment. AT&T's dividend yields 5.6% compared to Verizon's 5.3%. That said, AT&T's dividend payout ratio is slightly higher than Verizon's, making Verizon's dividend a bit safer. The competitive environment and the large debt loads at both companies have resulted in minimal dividend growth for both stocks in recent years, though. Each increased their dividend about 2% this year. At these prices, Verizon looks to be the better buy compared to AT&T stock. The former is already in the midst a turnaround in its wireless business, while AT&T is still struggling. Trading at a comparable value and with a comparable dividend yield, Verizon makes sense for most investors over AT&T. ","
      
    Better Buy: AT&T Inc. vs. Verizon Communications -- The Motley Fool

364,"Anders Bylund, Chris Neiger, and Jordan Wathen",12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. There's nothing quite like a good, solid oil dividend, right? Anyone looking for a strong dividend payout backed by torrential cash flows must surely be impressed by ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield and 34 years of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Exxon is indeed a great income stock, but there are many dividend stocks out there that offer even better policies than the oil giant. You don't even have to stick within the energy market. A panel of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool has put together a handful of stocks with better yields than ExxonMobil. Read on to see how Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) can beat the big oil stocks from the perspective of a dividend hunter. You can do better than Exxon. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Spirit Realty Capital): Shares of this retail-focused REIT are too cheap to ignore. Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9993
365,"Keith Noonan, Chris Neiger, and Daniel Miller",12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market at record highs, many investors are paying premiums for companies that appear capable of delivering big earnings growth over the long term. That sets them up with a potentially dangerous risk-reward dynamic. But you can still find growth stocks trading at significant discounts relative to their potential, if you know where to look. To give readers some leads on big growth opportunities that can be had on the cheap, we assembled a team of top Motley Fool investors and asked each one to profile a growth stock that they view as well worth the price of admission at current levels. Read on to see why they selected U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ:USCR), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UAA). Image source: Getty Images. Daniel Miller (U.S. Concrete): Finding growth stocks at deep value prices when markets have been consistently blowing through record highs is no simple task. However, in my view, U.S. Concrete fits that description. The company has bounced back from a 2010 bankruptcy and posted years of top- and bottom-line growth, but its market cap doesn't yet reflect its potential. USCR Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts After exiting bankruptcy protection and shedding its low-margin precast business, the company has been growing through bolt-on acquisitions -- a strategy it looks likely to continue using. Since 2014 alone, U.S. Concrete has completed 29 acquisitions in the ready-mixed concrete and aggregates space. Those new additions generated 40% of the company's adjusted EBITDA for the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. This could prove to be a opportune time for investors to jump in. Management believes the country is still in the early innings of this construction cycle, and that the administration's regulatory and business-tax-cutting agendas, along with the possibility of increased federal infrastructure spending, could make the cycle more lucrative for companies in its segment. U.S. Concrete holds a top-three position in the markets where it does business, is a top supplier to major commercial projects in those regions, and has a successful track record of acquisitions. And most important for those seeking growth stocks at deep value prices, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15 (per Morningstar.com) makes U.S. Concrete worth a look. Chris Neiger (Verizon): Verizon is looking a little rough around the edges right now. The company's share price is down about 3% this year, compared the S&P 500's nearly 19% gains, and its stock is trading at just 14 times estimated forward earnings. Verizon lost ground to rivals T-Mobile and AT&T in part because they've made gains on wireless network speed and reliability, and also because it was late to offer unlimited plans when its competitors were jumping into them. But the telecom giant's management has worked to right this ship, even if its share price doesn't reflect the results yet. Its postpaid phone subscribership grew by 274,000 in the third quarter, and by 358,000 in the quarter before that. That's worth noting because in the U.S. telecom space, the only way a carriers can grow significantly is by stealing customers away from others. Verizon is also making the wise move of cutting $10 billion from its budget between now and 2021, which should result in a stronger balance sheet. That should help as the company focuses some effort on building out its content offerings via AOL and the recently acquired Yahoo!. The 50 or so content brands under its new subsidiary, called Oath, offer new opportunities for Verizon to grow beyond its wireless business. But even if its content hopes don't pan out quite as expected, investors should still be bullish on the telecom's wireless position (it still holds a 36% share of the subscription market) and its opportunity to grow that business with its new 5G technologies. The company has conducted 5G wireless tests across U.S. cities this year, and has plans to roll out fixed 5G broadbroad connections next year. Verizon doubtless aims to capitalize on its first-mover advantage in the 5G space as it did with its early investments in 4G and LTE, which kept the company ahead of its competitors in the past. This stock's performance may not have been pretty lately, but Verizon still has a strong core business, and it's making big moves in the next  evolution of wireless. Add in the company's content opportunities -- and its 4.7% dividend yield -- and the stock starts looking much more attractive. Keith Noonan (Under Armour): A market darling just a few years prior, Under Armour has fallen out of favor due to a slew of setbacks and challenges. Its North American growth story has hit the skids, and there are concerns that the brand simply isn't cool with young people anymore -- a terrifying prospect for a fashion-based business. Downward sales and earnings revisions have replaced management's touting of its former quarterly double-digit revenue growth streak -- a contextual backdrop that explains why shares lost more than 60% of their value over the last three years. That's a truncated version of Under Armour's current woes, but, for investors willing to shoulder some risk and stake out a contrarian position, its stock could present deep value at current prices. With its brand struggling amid a broader slowdown in the American sports apparel market, Under Armour's foreign growth is more important than ever. The good news is that the picture overseas looks pretty promising. Last quarter, international sales climbed roughly 56% year over year, and operating income climbed 64%. With the North American retail environment under pressure, the company is also focusing more on making direct-to-consumer sales online, and on reducing its operating expenses. Those initiatives should help keep earnings steady as the company broadens its global sales base. Under Armour shares are trading near their five-year lows. While the company's forward P/E of roughly 68 is steep, the company is valued at just 1.2 times its trailing 12-month sales. This stock could wind up looking quite cheap at current prices if the company continues to deliver big international growth. ","
      
    3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9984
366,Leo Sun,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 was a dismal year for AT&T (NYSE:T) investors, who watched their stock drop 14% as the S&P 500 rallied 17%. The stock was weighed down by four straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines and ongoing losses in video subscribers. Analysts expect AT&T to finish fiscal 2017 with a 2% sales decline and 3% earnings growth. For 2018, both figures are expected to stay roughly flat. This doesn't make AT&T look like an exciting investment for the foreseeable future, but investors shouldn't overlook the four big moves that it will likely make next year. Image source: AT&T. AT&T is already America's second largest wireless carrier, top wireline services provider, and biggest pay TV provider thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If it closes its planned $85 billion takeover of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. The merger would introduce major bundling opportunities between its wireline, wireless, video streaming, and pay TV businesses. Those bundles could help AT&T counter cord cutters at its pay TV business, widen its moat against Netflix, and lock in more wireless customers. AT&T claims that the acquisition would become accretive to its adjusted earnings and free cash flow within the first year. However, the US Department of Justice recently sued to block the merger, on the grounds that it would create an anti-competitive ecosystem which would limit consumer choices and hurt streaming video providers. AT&T's top priority for 2018 will be to clear these regulatory hurdles and seal the deal. If it fails to do so, its stock could stumble. AT&T will also invest heavily in new towers to expand its pre-5G and 5G network capabilities across the 700 MHz, AWS-3, and WCS spectrums. Earlier this year, Barclays estimated that AT&T would deploy equipment on up to 50,000 towers, and build about 2,000 more new towers to upgrade its infrastructure and launch the FirstNet public safety network. AT&T also recently teamed up with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon has also been aggressively expanding its fiber assets -- via its purchases of Straight Path and XO Communications for nearly $5 billion -- ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. AT&T's acquisitions of spectrum licenses, DirecTV, and Time Warner are causing its debt levels to skyrocket. Its long-term debt hit $154.7 billion last quarter, up from $113.7 billion at the end of 2016. If the Time Warner deal closes, that figure could rise above $180 billion. AT&T has already been selling various non-core assets -- including certain cell towers, wireline operations, and data centers -- to extinguish some debt. But AT&T will likely need to sell more assets to further reduce that figure. Two possible divestments include its Digital Life home security business, which could net $1 billion in a sale, and its Latin American pay TV assets (excluding Mexico), which could be sold for $8 billion. It might also consider selling CNN to gain regulatory approval for the Time Warner deal. AT&T added three million wireless subscriptions (2.3 million in the US and nearly 700,000 in Mexico) last quarter. However, a growing number of those new subscriptions aren't for smartphones -- they're used to link tablets, wearables, drones, and connected cars to the internet with stand-alone connections. AT&T stated that it connected almost 100,000 vehicles last quarter, and that the auto market represented a ""real opportunity"" as infotainment and navigation devices rely more heavily on constant connections. AT&T's growth across these markets could diversify its business away from the saturated smartphone market. AT&T, like many of its telco rivals, will try to expand its digital ecosystem, upgrade its infrastructure, reach new wireless markets, and reduce its debt in 2018. That's a tough balancing act to pull off. However, AT&T's stock remains cheap at 13 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 5.3%. Therefore, investors looking for a cheap income play could consider buying this beaten-down stock -- as long they don't expect a big rebound over the next few quarters. ","
      
    What to Expect From AT&T, Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9897
367,"Jamal Carnette, CFA",12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely considered the next big thing in technology. Research firm IDC expects worldwide spending on the IoT to reach $1.4 trillion by 2021. Overall, networking communications provider Cisco expects the IoT to be a $19 trillion opportunity. Unsurprisingly, the Internet of Things requires an internet connection, and not just any internet connection. The sheer volume of devices that will now be connected to the internet will require lightning-fast data transfer, especially as the number of internet-connected devices proliferates. To accomplish this, wireless service providers will need to build out their networks to fifth-generation (5G) technology to provide the data-transfer speeds needed to fully support the IoT. The future of the IoT and 5G will most likely include autonomous cars. Image source: Getty Images. Morgan Stanley notes telecommunication providers like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are somewhat lukewarm on building out their 5G capability. This is significant because 5G is considered the backbone of the IoT. As Asha Keddy, general manager of mobile standards of Intel, said: The 2G networks were designed for voice, 3G for voice and data, and 4G for broadband internet experiences. With 5G, we'll see computing capabilities getting fused with communications everywhere, so trillions of things like wearable devices don't have to worry about computing power because network can do any processing needed. The report noted that telcos are somewhat apprehensive to move quickly on a 5G buildout because of 4G -- after spending a combined $275 billion on a rollout and densification of the current transfer standard, the industry has not seen significant returns on the investment. Instead, under pressure from T-Mobile, mobile continues to adopt policies like unlimited data and voice with strong price competition. While these policies are great for consumers, they are decidedly less so for wireless providers. Morgan Stanley notes that 5G will be different. First, the industry will spend less on the build-out and the rollout will take longer. From 2019 to 2040 the industry is estimated to spend $225 billion on 5G capital expenditures with the larger spend coming in the outer years. Additionally, Morgan Stanley expects the first 5G enabled smartphone will come to market as early as 2020, but real adoption and spending could take decades. Another factor that may delay 5G adoption is high debt levels. Verizon and AT&T are highly leveraged, and while both can service their debt easily, adding more obligations to highly leveraged balance sheets could result in downgrades and higher debt-servicing costs. Although mobile provider Sprint has a tremendous asset in the form of a 2.5GHz spectrum, the company has approximately $16 billion of debt maturing in the next three years. That's the equivalent of 85% of its total market cap, which will make it difficult to build out its 5G capabilities. Compounding 5G adoption is competing for business interests. Verizon now has Oath, its digital media business formed from its acquisition of Yahoo, AOL, and The Huffington Post. Both have wireline telephony and subscription-based television delivery, with Verizon FiOS and AT&T's recent DirecTV purchase. The latter two require high capex layouts that may compete for 5G spend. In the long run, the opportunity from the IoT is simply too big to ignore. The savings and value creation from automation and productivity increases should be world-changing. However, it's possible for the process to be delayed until mobile ISPs determine a compelling business case exists to build out 5G. It appears IPS's are at least starting the process. In Verizon's last quarterly call CFO Matt Ellis said Verizon was ""prepositioning"" for its 5G network. Sprint and T-Mobile have noted their intentions to launch a network in 2019, and AT&T is working on a 5G network as well. If the opportunity is as compelling as Cisco and IDC expect, it's possible for 5G buildout to occur faster than Morgan Stanley notes. ","
      
    Is This a Setback for the Internet of Things? -- The Motley Fool

368,Jason Hall,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Surprisingly enough, a huge portion of that value is derived from a very small group of companies. Of the thousands of publicly traded companies operating today, the 30 largest ones are worth almost $10 trillion -- about one-third of the entire market's value. Here is a closer look at each of the 30 biggest companies on the stock market. (Note: All market data as of Nov. 30, 2017.) Apple's iPhone X is just the latest tech marvel from the world's most valuable -- and profitable -- company. Image source: Apple. With a market capitalization of $868.8 billion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made for one of the greatest investing stories in history. And not once, but twice. Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, the early success of its Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh computers made it a huge financial success for anyone who invested in the company after its 1980 IPO. But a number of challenges and a power struggle led to the departure of Jobs in 1985. After years of steady loss of market share to another company on this list, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple brought Jobs back in 1997, when the company was on the brink of failure. Following his return, Apple went on to develop the iMac, iPod (and subsequently iTunes), and the product that has made it the most valuable public company on Earth: the iPhone in 2007. The company is on track to ship 30 million of its new iPhone X smartphones in the current quarter. Given their price of $999 to $1,149 each, the company should command more than $30 billion in sales this quarter from this single product. Image source: Google. The parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is worth $720.8 billion. But unlike Apple, which makes a living selling high-end tech devices, Alphabet doesn't charge its users much or anything at all for most of its services. YouTube, Google search, Gmail, Google Drive cloud storage, and Documents productivity software are all free at their basic levels, while some premium services -- like additional storage and ad-free content on YouTube -- are available for a modest fee. And Alphabet uses those massive profits to invest in even more innovation. The company is a leader in self-driving vehicle technology, clean energy, and connecting more of the world to the internet. Image source: Microsoft. Like Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) played a big role in the advent of affordable personal computing. But while Apple developed a fully integrated software and hardware system, Microsoft is all about software. It also was a big reason why Apple lost the home PC wars in the late 1980s, while Microsoft, with its ""Wintel"" duopoly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) (which is also on this list) went on to command virtually the entire personal computer market for decades. However, Microsoft has all but missed out on the smartphone revolution, with its Windows Phone never really garnering much commercial success. However, this lack of success with handheld devices hasn't kept Big Softy from being wildly profitable and still a growth company. After all, the company's operating systems and other software are still critically important to running the infrastructure that powers much of the world's computing power. Microsoft has become a major player in cloud computing, a huge growth market. The company increased its market share last year, growing segment revenue 14% to $7 billion last quarter alone. Microsoft may have lost out to Apple in mobile computing, but it's not going to miss out on the cloud. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of few companies to emerge from the late 1990s tech bubble a success. And with a market cap of $560 billion, it easily qualifies as the biggest. Started by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore, Amazon sells just about everything today, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Prime membership program for free shipping, free TV, and free movie streaming. Prime members count on Amazon as their first -- and often only -- stop for online shopping. The company's sales are growing strongly: Last quarter alone, revenue was up 34% to $44 billion. E-commerce isn't the only nascent industry Amazon is dominating, either. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the company's cloud computing provider, and Amazon commands substantial market share in this space as one of the lowest-cost providers. Last quarter, AWS generated almost $1.2 billion in operating income for Amazon, and it's set for potentially years of growth to come. Image source: Getty Images. The dominant social media platform, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), is worth $508.9 billion. Founded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several other Harvard students in 2004, it was initially available only to fellow Harvard classmates and then a few other colleges. More than 26% of humanity regularly uses Facebook. That's a stunning figure, but it also means about three-fourths of us don't. Facebook's management would tell you that's room for growth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Led by legendary investor and CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is worth $468.4 billion. Since Buffett took over the company 50 years ago -- it was a struggling textile manufacturer at the time -- and converted it into a holding company for his various other investments, Berkshire has created enormous wealth for tens of thousands of shareholders. Today, Berkshire is a sprawling conglomerate, with subsidiaries engaged in insurance, railways, candy making, manufacturing, electricity production, and too many other businesses to name here. Much of Berkshire's value also owes to its stock portfolio, which includes a number of the other companies on this list. At last count, Berkshire's stock holdings were worth about $180 billion, an amount that's likely to grow for years to come. Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma. Image source: Alibabagroup.com. Alibaba Group has rocketed up the top 30 list on expectations that its growth is just getting started. This year, the stock price has climbed 90%, even after a recent 9% drop. With China's middle class on track to crack 500 million people within a few years, Alibaba's best days could well be ahead. Image source: Johnson & Johnson. More than 130 years after its founding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is still one of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry, as reflected by its $375 million market value. Best-known for consumer brands including Band-Aid and Tylenol, the healthcare giant is also a major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Last quarter, its pharmaceutical segment generated almost half of sales, while medical devices were worth twice as much revenue as the consumer-goods segment. Looking ahead, JNJ's management is banking on the need for more healthcare spending as a significant portion of the world's population gets older. Life expectancies are increasing, but it will require significant medical support to care for a growing aging population. Even after 130 years of success, the company's future still looks bright. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has its roots as far back as 1799, with the founding of one of its predecessors, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. After dozens of acquisitions and mergers in the many years since, today's JPMorgan Chase is America's biggest bank, and one of the world's largest by total assets. It's worth $360 million at recent share prices. Since the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, has built up a fortress-like balance sheet and developed some of the most conservative lending practices in the industry. So, even as one of the biggest banks out there, it is also considered one of the safest for investors to own. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $348.6 billion, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is similar to JPMorgan Chase in that it's a product of numerous acquisitions and mergers over the years. It also has its roots in the early days of the American oil industry, directly descended from multiple companies that were part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A true integrated ""supermajor,"" ExxonMobil participates in every aspect of the oil and gas value chain, including exploration and production, distribution, refining and chemical manufacturing, and selling refined products. Last quarter, this generated $66 billion in sales and $4 billion in profits -- better than recent quarters thanks to higher oil prices. But at the same time, there are growing concerns that the advent of cheaper renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles will start making fossil fuels irrelevant sooner than many expect. Image source: Bank of America. With a market cap of $295.7 billion, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is second to JPMorgan Chase among the most valuable U.S. banks. It's also the nation's second-biggest bank by assets as well. Unlike many of its megabank peers, Bank of America's roots aren't in New York: The company started with the founding of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to serve the large immigrant community in the city, which faced discrimination by other banks at the time. By the late 1920s, Bank of Italy was renamed Bank of America and Italy, and it would merge with another California-based bank named -- you guessed it -- Bank of America. Now headquartered in North Carolina, B of A was one of the banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, with two major acquisitions -- Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- leading to billions of dollars in losses, as well as tens of billions in fines and penalties related to Countrywide's mortgage practices. But today, Bank of America has emerged strong and profitable under the solid leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Wal-Mart stores. Even as e-commerce becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, brick-and-mortar behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a retail giant, with a market cap of $289.8 billion. Founded by Sam Walton in the early 1960s, Wal-Mart now operates more than 11,600 stores, it sold $486 billion in merchandise last year, and it employs 2.3 million people around the world. And don't count the discount retailer out of the retail future, either. The company has aggressively invested in growing its e-commerce business, and it's paying off. Last quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 50%, helping drive total sales up 4.2%. The ""death of retail"" may be grossly exaggerated, at least when it comes to Wal-Mart. Image source: Wells Fargo. The third bank to make the first half of our top 30, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) makes the list at $279.3 billion. Founded in 1852 in San Francisco early during the gold rush, it not only offered banking services, but also express service to deliver gold and other valuables quickly. And while the modern Wells Fargo is the product -- like almost every big bank -- of numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, its success has generally been a product of conservative management and lending practices that have kept it out of trouble during the numerous banking crises over the past 150-plus years. But that story may be changing. More recently, Wells' results have trailed its peers' as the effects of the fake accounts scandal play out. Last quarter, Wells was the only big bank to report a decline in its revenue, and it also saw earnings per share fall more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. In short, there's evidence that customers are avoiding Wells, and choosing instead to bank with its competitors. Over time, it's likely that this will change as long as the company can get its act together. But in the meantime, its tarnished reputation is hurting its bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $271.9 billion, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B) is the second-most valuable public energy company on the U.S. market, behind only ExxonMobil. Also like ExxonMobil, Shell is an integrated supermajor, engaging in the full range of oil and gas industry businesses. But Shell is a bit different from ExxonMobil in its strategy. Following its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, management launched a strategic shift toward natural gas, where it sees greater long-term demand growth versus oil. The company has also made reducing debt -- which ballooned to over $95 billion at the peak -- and expenses a priority, as well as taking steps to increase the return on its investments. Shell has only just begun chipping away at its debt, but over the past year, profits and cash flows have surged on improved operating results, as well as higher oil prices. Shell is still exposed to many of the same risks as ExxonMobil when it comes to disruption from renewables, but that's one of the reasons management has prioritized natural gas, which produces fewer emissions and serves more industrial uses than oil. Image source: Visa. It may surprise you to know that electronic payments network giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), with a market cap of $249.8 billion, has only been a public company for about 10 years. Started in 1958 as part of Bank of America and called BankAmericard, it would not become a separate company until 1970, and even then, it was largely under the control of the many banks that issued BankAmericards. In 1968, it would formally change its name -- and the name of the cards issued on its network -- to Visa, but it would remain privately held until finally going public in March 2008. Visa's IPO, which was for half of the company's shares, raised $19.1 billion, making it the biggest-ever IPO at the time. Even with its massive size, Visa still has strong growth prospects. Electronic payments are only a small fraction of global transactions, but that's quickly changing as mobile computing and the global middle class converge. As a trusted name that merchants, financial institutions, and customers all count on, Visa is positioned for many more years of growth. Image source: Procter & Gamble. With a market cap of $226.8 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the most valuable makers of branded consumer products in the world. There's a  good chance you have at least one P&G product in your home right now -- and more likely several. The company's most recognizable brands include Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Vicks, but that's just a handful of the more than 60 brands the company makes and sells in over 180 countries. Founded in 1837, the company has spent the past 180 years developing and acquiring products that people use in their daily lives, many of which were major innovations at the time. More recently, the company has struggled to grow, having already expanded into just about every global market, and also facing stiff competition in many of its core segments. This has led management to streamline its brands and focus more intently on its most important businesses. Since 2013, the company has reduced its brand portfolio by more than half. Sales have fallen almost $15 billion since then, but earnings have improved since bottoming out in 2015. This is helping the company continue its track record of dividend growth. P&G has increased its dividend annually for 61 straight years. Image source: Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest and most valuable telecommunications company on the U.S. market, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is worth $224 billion. When Alexander Graham Bell founded AT&T in 1885, he probably didn't have any idea how much his company would transform over the next 130 years, while also staying remarkably the same. AT&T is still the largest provider of fixed-line telephone access in the U.S., but it's also the second-largest cellphone cellphone service provider, and the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., through its U-Verse cable and DirecTV satellite subsidiaries. The company is looking to get even bigger, with a pending acquisition for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in the works. However, the U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to sue over the proposed acquisition, creating some uncertainty (and a lot of drama thanks to the political implications). Image source: Getty Images. The third integrated super-major on this list, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is worth $222.6 billion. The company's roots go all the way back to 1879, with the founding of Pacific Coast Oil Co. in San Francisco and developing some of the state's earliest oil discoveries in Southern California. Coast oil would be acquired by Standard Oil in 1900 and consolidate its operations and take the Standard name in 1906. In 1911, it once again became a separate company when the federal government's antitrust suit led to the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil behemoth. Following decades of growth and expansion both in the U.S. and abroad, the company finally changed its name to Chevron in 1977 as part of its move to merge six domestic operations into one. Today, Chevron is solidly profitable, but its earnings and cash flows are still far below its historical levels, as it just isn't getting the same kinds of returns on its investments at recent oil prices. However, its results have improved over the past year as oil prices have risen. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $216 billion, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is the second-most valuable healthcare company and the most valuable health insurer and managed care provider in the United States. Founded in 1974 as Charter Med Incorporated, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created in 1977 as the parent company and taken public in 1984. In the 40 years since its founding, the Minnesota-based healthcare giant has steadily grown by expanding into new markets and acquiring companies in markets it wanted to enter. It also expanded its services to include prescription management and mail-order services, among others. At last count, the company insures 49 million people, and it generated more than $50 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in operating income in its most recent quarter. Image source: Pfizer. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is the third-most valuable healthcare company on this list, with a $215.8 billion market cap. Founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849, Pfizer found early success as a so-called ""fine chemicals"" maker for most of the first century of its existence. In the early 1950s, Pfizer scientists would discover and develop the antibiotic Terramycin, one of the first steps that began shifting its focus to research and development of pharmaceuticals. Over the past couple of decades, Pfizer has largely grown via acquisition of competitors including Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Wyeth in 2009, both of which have produced mixed results. Going forward, management continues to consider acquisitions to help augment its in-house R&D pipeline for new medicines. Image source: Roche. The third healthcare company in a row on this list, Switzerland-based Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), is worth $214.5 billion. Founded in 1986 by young entrepreneur Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, Roche's roots are in the industrial manufacture of medicines. Fast-forward 130 years, and Roche is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the pharmaceutical industry, with a major pipeline of potential cancer treatments, including immunotherapies. Roche is also one of the biggest R&D spenders in the healthcare space, having spent nearly $9 billion to develop new medicines and treatments last year alone. Image source: Getty Images. With nearly 875 million subscribers on its network, China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:CHL) is easily one of the world's biggest wireless providers, and it's worth $208.9 billion. One would expect it to carry a higher value, perhaps, due to its size and potential for growth. However, China Mobile -- and its biggest competitors -- are pretty much controlled by the Chinese government, which heavily regulates the wireless market in the country. Even with that reality, China Mobile is likely to grow in value as China's middle class continues to expand and mobile use becomes more prevalent. Mobile data consumption is also likely to increase across both consumer and business customers in the coming years, and that could be a catalyst for further growth for the Chinese wireless giant. Image source: Getty Images. Founded in 1979 with the opening of two stores in metro Atlanta, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is worth $207 billion, only trailing Wal-Mart for U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers in market value. It's also very different from Wal-Mart and other general merchandise retailers, with many of the products it sells being highly resistant to infringement from e-commerce. This includes products like lumber, which carpenters and builders often prefer to hand select, as well as items customers want to choose in person, such as tile, flooring, paint, cabinets, fixtures, and other big-ticket items you have to live with every day. It's certainly played out that way. While many other big-box retailers struggle just to keep the doors open, Home Depot's sales have increased 6% so far this year, and earnings are on track to grow 14%. Image source: Intel. The other half of the ""Wintel"" duopoly with Microsoft that dominated personal computing for more than two decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968 and is worth $205.7 billion today, making it the the most valuable stand-alone semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Also like Microsoft, Intel has had middling success in mobile computing while remaining incredibly strong in the data centers that drive cloud computing and corporate infrastructures. However, there's some concern that the company's fortress-like competitive position in the data center could be weakening. If that proves to be true, and competitors start taking market share, that would seriously crimp Intel's future prospects. But with a half-century of successful innovation in microprocessors, and one of the biggest R&D budgets in the space, I wouldn't count Intel out just yet. Image source: Getty Images. Like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in the manufacture of microprocessors, and it has a similar market value of $204.4 billion. However, it's also a very different company, since Intel designs and develops nearly all of the processors it makes, while Taiwan Semiconductor primarily contracts with so-called ""fabless"" semiconductor designers -- companies like Apple -- to manufacture chips for them. The upside is the company doesn't have to spend nearly as much on R&D -- it spent $11 billion less than Intel over the past year -- and instead focuses on high-quality, low-cost manufacturing while its customers invest in chip design. The downside? Maintaining a competitive advantage to keep those fabless chip designers coming to you for chip fabrication. It's certainly worked well for Taiwan Semiconductor, which has seen its earnings and market value grow more than 250% over the past decade, better than Intel over the same period. Image source: Verizon. With a market cap of $203.6 billion, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the second-biggest telecommunications company in the U.S. behind AT&T. Verizon leads the U.S. wireless market with 149 million customers, and it also has one of the biggest land-line operators. The company has also increased the size of its wireline internet business in recent years and says it now has 5.8 million customers using its Fios fiber-optic internet service. But where Verizon trails AT&T is in pay-TV subscribers, a gap that's likely to grow even wider when AT&T completes its acquisition of Time Warner. Will Verizon make an acquisition of its own to narrow the gap? It's unclear, but the company is certainly investing in next-generation wireless technology, with plans to begin testing a 5G network in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Business software specialist Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is worth $202.4 billion. Like almost every other tech company that's been successful for many years, Oracle has spent decades out-innovating (or sometimes acquiring) its disruptors. In recent years, this has included a shift to subscription models for software -- something Oracle is still working through -- and now the company is facing stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and other cloud-computing providers. Going forward, Oracle may have to prove its mettle all over again in the ever-important enterprise database segment it has dominated for years. The early results offer promise, but it's in the very early innings as the company's customers -- almost 40% of the market for enterprise database software -- begin to compare in-house systems to cloud-hosted alternatives. Image source: Citigroup. With a market cap of $198.4 billion, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is the last bank in the top 30 and the fourth-most valuable bank behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. With over 200 million global customers and 219,000 employees, Citigroup does business in 160 countries around the world. With its roots in the founding of City Bank of New York in 1812, it underwent a series of name changes over the next 160 years before finally becoming Citibank in 1976. The current Citigroup was formed when Citicorp -- Citibank's holding company -- merged with Travelers Group in 1998. Citigroup was one of the hardest-hit banks during the subprime crisis and Great Recession, with its significant exposure to bad mortgages -- both directly through its lending and through its investment in collateralized debt obligations -- which led to substantial losses, and eventually required federal government intervention to keep the bank from failing. This intervention and investment essentially wiped out investors in the company. Even after a pretty big recovery in the past decade, Citigroup investors from right before the financial crisis are still down about 75%. On the other side of the coin, anyone savvy -- or lucky -- enough to have invested in the company in March of 2009 and held their shares has seen a fourfold return on their investment. Image source: Novartis. Another Swiss pharmaceutical company on the list, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) rounds out the top 30 with a market cap of $198.2 billion. But unlike Roche, which was founded more than a century ago, Novartis is the result of multiple corporate mergers, though several of its legacy companies do date back to the 1800s. However, Novartis is similar to Roche in several regards. The company spent $7.9 billion on pharmaceutical research and development last year, second only to Roche in pharmaceutical R&D investment. Much of that spending is on development of biologics and immunotherapies, two of the areas of medicine with the most promise for treatments with fewer side effects and better results. With expectations that the company will file for approval of five new molecules in 2018, Novartis's R&D investments seem to be paying off. ","

The cities are all expected to be outside Verizon’s existing landline footprint in the Northeast. The company said more details, such as its price, would be unveiled later. The wireless giant will use fifth generation, or 5G, technology, which is capable of delivering significantly faster internet speeds than existing 4G technology, also known as LTE. Customers will likely have to place a box in their windows that will convert Verizon’s wireless signals into Wi-Fi inside the house. If the technology works, and users adopt it, it could result in more competition in the home internet market. Many Americans only have access to one broadband provider, often a cable company.

371,,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines on Thursday to repeal landmark 2015 rules aimed at ensuring a free and open internet, setting up a court fight over a move that could recast the digital landscape. The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access. It also is the biggest win for Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations since taking over at the agency in January. Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers. The meeting, held amid protests online and in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington, was evacuated before the vote for about 10 minutes due to an unspecified security threat, and resumed after law enforcement with sniffer dogs checked the room. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the  administration “supports the FCC’s efforts. At the same time, the White House certainly has and always will support a free and fair internet.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal. Shares of Alphabet, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp moved lower after the vote. The FCC said the rules would take effect in a few months after the White House Office of Management and Budget formally approves them. Pai has argued that the 2015 rules were heavy handed and stifled competition and innovation among service providers. “The internet wasn’t broken in 2015. We weren’t living in a digital dystopia,” he said on Thursday. Consumers are unlikely to see immediate changes but smaller startups worry the lack of restrictions could drive up costs or lead to their content being blocked. Internet service providers say they will not block or throttle legal content but may engage in paid prioritization. They argue that the largely unregulated internet functioned well in the two decades before the 2015 order. Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly noted that self-driving vehicles and remotely monitored medical procedures may require internet service and that their needs could be given priority “over cat videos.” O’Rielly said it is unlikely any internet provider would voluntarily submit to a “PR nightmare” by “attempting to engage in blocking, throttling or improper discrimination. It is simply not worth the reputation cost.” Still, Democrats have pointed to polls showing a repeal is deeply unpopular and say they will prevail in protecting the rules, either in the courts or in U.S. Congress. Immediately after the vote, Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, said he and 15 other senators planned to introduce a resolution to undo the FCC action and restore the net neutrality rules. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said in a written dissent released on Thursday that the decision grants internet providers “extraordinary new power” from the FCC. “They have the technical ability and business incentive to discriminate and manipulate your internet traffic,” she said. “And now this agency gives them the legal green light to go ahead.” Several state attorneys general said before the vote they would oppose the ruling, citing issues with the public comment period. Other critics have said they will consider challenging what they see as weaker enforcement. The 2015 rules were intended to give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband providers from favoring their own content. Those practices are now allowed as long as they are disclosed. The broadband industry cheered the move. USTelecom, a lobbying group representing internet providers and broadband companies said after the vote they had “renewed confidence” to make network investments, particularly in rural communities. On the other side, the trade group Internet Association, whose members include content providers Alphabet, Facebook and Pandora Media Inc, said “the fight isn’t over” and that it was weighing legal options in a lawsuit against the FCC order. A University of Maryland poll had found more than 80 percent of respondents opposed a repeal. The survey of 1,077 registered voters was conducted online by the Program for Public Consultation from Dec. 6-8. ","

372,,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission plans to turn over oversight of internet service providers to another federal agency as it plans to vote on Thursday to revoke the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” rules. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content. The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content. On Monday, the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts under the new rules. The agencies said the  proposal will “return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs.” Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “will work together to take targeted action against bad actors.” Under Pai’s proposal, the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block, throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said the agreement “is a confusing, lackluster, reactionary afterthought: an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman’s draft proposal repealing the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rules.” The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices. “The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers,” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said “FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact — many months, if not years, after consumers and businesses have been harmed.” Chris Lewis, vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge, said the FCC is “joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public. This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you.” The new rules are expected to take effect in January and draw court challenges.

Don't show this again Two official trials have begun for AirGig, technology to send internet data along power lines and into your home. AT&T's AirGig technology sends data along antennas mounted to power line towers or poles. Sure, you can dig trenches across the land and fill them up with fiber-optic cables, but AT&T has begun testing what it says is a promising alternative called AirGig that relies on radio signals instead. Unveiled last year, AirGig sends data from one antenna to another along power lines in rural, suburban or urban areas. It also sends data to nearby buildings at speeds of about 1 gigabit per second -- something like 15 times faster than the average US broadband data-transfer rate. AT&T now has two trials underway, one a suburban test in an undisclosed country outside the US, and another in partnership with Georgia Power in a more rural location, the company announced Tuesday night. ""If these trials and our continued research and development turn out the way we intend, we'll take a big step toward bringing hyperfast connectivity to people everywhere,""  Andre Fuetsch, president of AT&T Labs and the company's chief technology officer, said in a statement. Hyperfast internet access sounds hyperbolic, but there's our appetite for network data is insatiable and growing, so any new technology can help. In practice, we're likely to be served by new short- and long-range radio links, ever-faster data links on traditional phone and cable TV lines to our homes, and fiber optic lines, too. Indeed, AT&T's broadband business is stringing fiber along phone lines in several cities around the US. The tests are going well in both the rural and suburban areas, a sign that it's meeting its potential, AT&T said. The tests will last months, but it's not yet clear when AT&T will commercialize the technology. AirGig has the potential to stretch to some rural areas where expensive and pokey satellite-based broadband is the only practical option. But even though AT&T says it takes only minutes for trained operators to install the antennas, hardware and labor costs will add up over the miles. AirGig also could serve as something of a backbone for the 5G mobile networks expected to arrive starting in 2019, AT&T said. Today's phones use fourth-generation (4G) mobile network technology called LTE, but 5G is expected to boost speed and reliability, especially in crowded areas.

374, ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc has started trials in Georgia state and a non-U.S. location to deliver high-speed internet over power lines, the No. 2 wireless carrier said on Wednesday, marking its latest push to offer faster broadband service to more customers. AT&T aims to eventually deliver speeds faster than the 1 gigabit per second consumers can currently get through fiber internet service using high-frequency airwaves that travel along power lines. While the Georgia trial is in a rural area, the service could potentially be deployed in suburbs and cities, the company said in a statement. “We think this product is eventually one that could actually serve anywhere near a power line,” said Marachel Knight, AT&T’s senior vice president of wireless network architecture and design, in an interview. She added that AT&T chose an international trial location in part because the market opportunity extends beyond the United States. AT&T said it had no timeline for commercial deployment and that it would look to expand trials as it develops the technology. “Potentially, it can be a really big deal,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “You need the power company to play ball with you. That’s the downside.” AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, have also been testing 5G internet services in which the last leg of the connection is delivered via a radio signal to homes using high-frequency airwaves known as millimeter wave spectrum. Verizon said in November it would launch the faster broadband service in three to five U.S. markets in 2018. ","

Late on Tuesday, the court appeared to dismiss his opinion, saying in a brief filing that “Dr. Page’s submission does not appear to be meaningfully relevant to the issues in this case.” Trump criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and has repeatedly attacked the reporting of Time Warner’s CNN news network. Page said in an interview with Reuters that he had not been in contact with the White House about the filing. The U.S. Department of Justice sued AT&T in November to block its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, saying the deal could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers while hampering the development of online video. A trial is set for March 19. Both AT&T and the Justice Department declined to comment. “This market power concentrated in the hands of a few dominant mega corporate telecommunications-media conglomerates encourages extreme levels of journalistic recklessness and impropriety since it allocates considerable resources to the media outlets under their control,” Page said in the court papers. Page, who traveled to Russia twice in 2016, has testified to   congressional committees investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In that testimony and elsewhere, he has argued that he has been the subject of unfair and inaccurate media coverage. Page, who described himself as a “junior, unpaid, informal adviser” to the Trump campaign, also argued that it would provide an incentive for the big media outlets to exclude viewpoints it does not like.

376, ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'B'/'RR4' rating to Windstream Services, LLC's new 8.75% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2024. The new 2024 notes are pari passu to the company's existing unsecured notes and are being issued in exchange for a portion of 7.75% senior notes due 2021 and 7.50% senior notes due 2022. On Dec.12, 2017, Windstream announced results for debt exchange offers announced on Nov. 28, 2017. Approximately 86% ($538 million) and 85% ($232 million) of 2021 and 2022 noteholders, respectively, have accepted the exchange offers as of the early settlement date. The debt exchanges would entail higher incremental interest cost for Windstream, but the lower maturity wall in the intermediate term would help improve the liquidity position. The new 2024 notes are subject to a mandatory redemption of $150 million, 75 days after the initial settlement date. The covenants restrict payments to the parent, Windstream Holdings, Inc., if leverage is equal or greater than 3.5x, with carve-outs for master lease payments by parent to Uniti Group Inc. and certain administrative and tax payments. Windstream also announced 2023 exchange offer, where it offered to exchange 7.50% senior notes due 2023 for 6 3/8% notes maturing in 2023. As of the early settlement date, 57% ($68 million in aggregate principal) of the note holders had tendered to exchange, lower than the minimum $90 million required per 2023 exchange conditions. The company has extended the deadline until Dec. 26, 2017. Windstream's ratings are on Negative Watch after the company received a notice of default from Aurelius Capital Master Ltd., a noteholder on its 6 3/8% bonds. Windstream is defending the allegations and has filed a legal proceeding on the matter. Windstream has obtained the consent solicitations for waiver of the alleged defaults from a majority of 6 3/8% noteholders. Fitch will resolve the Watch following the resolution of the pending litigation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Near-Term Pressures: Including the EarthLink merger and Broadview Networks acquisition (the transactions), Windstream continued to experience pressure in its wholesale segment, as well as the small/medium business incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) segment through the third quarter of 2017 (3Q17). The enterprise segment remains weak due to effects of legacy revenue declines. Competitive local exchange (CLEC) consumer and small business has shown stabilization in 3Q17, benefitting from acquisition-related segment revenue. Pro forma for the transactions, Fitch's base case assumes revenues continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. Revenue Mix Changes: Windstream derives approximately two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise services, consumer high-speed internet services and its carrier customers (core and wholesale), providing the best prospects for stable revenues in the long term. Certain legacy revenues remain pressured, but Windstream's revenues should stabilize gradually as legacy revenues dwindle in the mix. Leverage Metrics: Fitch estimates total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be 5.8x in 2017, including the transactions. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. In calculating total adjusted debt, Fitch applies an 8x multiple to the sum of the annual rental payment to Uniti plus other rental expenses. Cost Synergies Support EBITDA Stabilization: Windstream anticipates realizing more than $180 million of annual run-rate synergies three years after the close of the transactions: $155 million in operating cost savings and $25 million in capital spending savings. Windstream expects to realize approximately $180 million in run-rate synergies by the end of 2019. In its base case assumptions for Windstream, Fitch has assumed moderately lower cost savings to be realized by the end of three years following the transactions. Fitch expects EBITDAR margin improvement in the range of 100bps-200bps by the end of 2019. Integration Key to Success: Fitch believes there are potential execution risks to achieving the operating cost and capital expenditure synergies following the close of the transactions. Initial savings are expected to be realized from reduced selling, general and administrative savings as corporate overheads and other public company cost savings arise. Over time, the company is expected to realize the benefits of lower network access costs as on-network opportunities lower third-party network access costs. Finally, cost savings are expected to be realized by IT and the billing system. Fitch estimated $20 million of these savings in 4Q17. DERIVATION SUMMARY Windstream has a weaker competitive position based on scale and size of its operations in the higher-margin enterprise market. Larger companies, including AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable), and CenturyLink, Inc. (BB/Stable), have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. In comparison to Windstream, AT&T and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch also believes Windstream has a weaker FCF profile than CenturyLink including the LVLT acquisition, as CenturyLink's FCF will benefit from enhanced scale and LVLT's net operating loss carryforwards. Although Windstream has less exposure to the more volatile residential market compared to its wireline peer, Frontier Communications Corp. (B+/Stable), it has higher leverage than Frontier. Within the residential market, incumbent wireline providers face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple play offerings, including Comcast Corp. (A-/Stable) and Charter Communications Inc. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC, BB+/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline providers have had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. As of year-end 2016, roughly 60% of Windstream's footprint overlapped with a national cable operator. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue and EBITDA include the EarthLink merger as of Feb. 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Broadview on July 28, 2017. --Revenues total $5.9 billion for 2017 and remain almost flat in 2018. Fitch expects organic revenue to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. --2017 EBITDA is expected to benefit from synergies achieved from acquisitions and other cost savings. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to expand by roughly 70bps in 2018 as additional cost synergies are realized. --Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline from 5.8x at year-end 2017 to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --The company sustains total adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 5.0x-5.2x. --Revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize on a sustained basis. --Fitch would also need to see progress by Windstream on executing the integration of its recent transactions. --Material reduction in leverage on a sustained basis following any asset sales repayment of debt could also benefit the rating. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 6.0-6.2x or higher for a sustained period. --The company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability due to competitive and business conditions. --Evidence of deterioration in liquidity, including lack of positive run-rate FCFs and declining FCF margin. --Any negative developments related to the outcome of the receipt of notice of default. Fitch intends to resolve the Rating Watch once it can be sufficiently determined that the allegations under the notice will not affect Windstream's credit profile. LIQUIDITY The rating is supported by the liquidity provided by Windstream's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). At Sept. 30, 2017, approximately $129 million was available (pro forma for the recently completed debt exchanges, approximately $410 million is available under the revolver). The revolver availability was supplemented with $56.5 million in cash at the end of 3Q17. The $1.25 billion senior secured RCF is in place until April 2020. Principal financial covenants in Windstream's secured credit facilities require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x. Outside of annual term loan amortization payments, Windstream does not have any material maturities until 2020. The recent debt exchanges helped Windstream extend the maturities, improving the liquidity profile. Windstream utilized the proceeds from new money 2025 senior secured notes to repay $250 million under the revolver and $140 million under term loan tranche B6. Pro forma for the debt exchanges, and repayment of revolver, maturities in 2020 total approximately $1.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Fitch estimates post-dividend FCF in 2017 will range from negative $100 to negative $200 million, including integration capex, $50 million of spending related to the completion of Project Excel and other cash non-operating expenses. Fitch expects capital spending to return to normal levels in the 13%-15% range after 2017 and for the company to return to positive FCF in 2018, with FCF margins in the low single digits over the forecast. RECOVERY The recovery analysis assumes that Windstream would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. Windstream's going concern EBITDA is based on LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017, pro forma for acquisitions and synergies. The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level, upon which Fitch bases the valuation of the company. A lower going-concern EBITDA factors in the competitive dynamics of the industry that result in account losses and pricing pressures. The overall decline also considers Windstream's cost cutting efforts as an offsetting factor. This leads to a post-reorganization EBITDA estimate of approximately $1.2 billion that is 20% below pro forma LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017. The current network lease with Uniti is expected to remain unchanged. An EV multiple of 4.5x is used to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. Comparable market multiples in the industry range from 5.4x-8.7x and recent acquisition multiples range from 3.8x-6.6x. There are two bankruptcy cases analyzed in Fitch's TMT bankruptcy case study report - Fairpoint and Hawaiian Telecom - both of which filed bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. Both were also sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x. The recovery multiple takes into account Windstream's weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch's multiple for Windstream's recovery analysis also considers dependence on legacy revenues that will decline in future, aided by revenue from recent acquisitions in cloud and connectivity space. The revolving facility is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The waterfall analysis results in a 100% recovery corresponding to a 'RR1' Recovery Rating for the secured debt including the first-lien credit facility and revolving facility; and the newly issued senior secured notes. The senior secured tranche of Windstream's capital structure benefits from a first-priority lien on all assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries (subject to regulatory approval) and a guaranty from Windstream's material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (except for subsidiaries of PAETEC Holding Corp and subject to regulatory approval). The waterfall also indicates an 'RR4' (41%) recovery for senior unsecured notes. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has maintained the following ratings: Windstream Services, LLC --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B'; --$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2020 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured term loans at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured notes due 2025 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior unsecured notes at 'B/RR4'. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative. Contact: Primary Analyst Salonie Sehgal Associate Director +1-312-368-3137 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

377, ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - La Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de Estados Unidos votó el jueves en favor de rechazar las históricas reglas aprobadas en 2015 para asegurar un internet libre y abierto, poniendo en marcha un pulso judicial por una decisión que podría redibujar el panorama digital. La aprobación de la propuesta del presidente a la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, significó una victoria para proveedores de servicios en internet como AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp y Verizon Communications Inc, ya que les da poder sobre los contenidos a los que pueden acceder los consumidores. Los demócratas, Hollywood y compañías como Alphabet Inc -matriz de Google- y Facebook Inc habían pedido a Pai, un republicano nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump, que mantuviera el reglamento de tiempos de Barack Obama, que prohíbe a los proveedores de servicios bloquear, ralentizar el acceso o cobrar más por determinados contenidos. Asociaciones de defensa de los consumidores y grupos comerciales que representan a proveedores de contenidos planean poner en marcha un reto legal para preservar estas reglas. La reunión fue evacuada durante unos 10 minutos antes de la votación, debido a una amenaza de seguridad no especificada, y se reanudó después de que perros entrenados revisaron la sala. La demócrata Mignon Clyburn, comisionada de la FCC, dijo antes de la votación que los republicanos están “entregando las llaves de Internet” a “un puñado de corporaciones multimillonarias”. Pai argumentó que la legislación de 2015 es muy dura y complica la competencia y la innovación entre los prestadores de servicios. Los miembros de la FCC votaron por 3-2 en favor de rechazar las reglas, en línea con sus partidos afines. Los proveedores de servicios por internet aseguran que no bloquearán ni acelerarán contenido legal, aunque sí podrían optar por una priorización pagada. Asimismo, aseguran que los consumidores no experimentarán cambios y argumentan que internet funcionó bien en las dos décadas previas a la orden de 2015, cuando estaba bastante desregulado. ","

378, ,12142017,Reuters,12072017,ネット通信を巡る環境は、ＦＣＣが中立性規則導入に合意した２年前から劇的に変わろうとしている。パイＦＣＣ委員長が主導してきた中立性規則撤廃により、ネット接続事業者（ＩＳＰ）は特定コンテンツへのアクセス遮断や速度制限、ないしは消費者への料金上乗せといった行為が禁止されなくなる。今後ＩＳＰは公益業ではなく、より監督が緩い情報サービス業に分類されるからだ。 来年初めから実施される中立性規則撤廃は、ＩＳＰがアクセス遮断や速度制限をする場合は、その情報を開示することが前提となる。各企業の情報開示が正確かどうか監視し、正確性を確保する任務は連邦取引委員会（ＦＴＣ）が担う。 ＦＣＣは２０１５年にネット中立規則をまとめ上げる前、２つの業界から起こされた訴訟で敗北した。昨年には連邦控訴裁が、ネット中立性規則の正当性を支持した一方、ＩＳＰの具体的な分類はＦＣＣの権限に属するとの見解を示した。 このように司法判断が揺れ動いているため、議会にもネット通信規則のあり方をはっきり定めろという圧力がかかっている。マイク・コフマン下院議員のような一部の共和党員さえ、議会が関連法案を策定するまでＦＣＣに中立性規則撤廃案の採決を待ってほしいと要請した。上院では共和党のジョン・スーン商業科学運輸委員長がこの問題に取り組んでいるところだ。 １４日のＦＣＣの採決でパイ氏とともに中立性規則撤廃に賛成したマイケル・オライリー委員は、恐らく議会だけが白黒をつけて、決まったことを恒久化できると発言した。それまでネット規制を巡る情勢はしばらく曲折があるだろう。 ●背景となるニュース ＊ＦＣＣは１４日の採決で、２０１５年に導入したネット中立性規則撤廃を正式承認した。５人の委員のうち、パイ委員長を含めた共和党の３人が賛成した。 ＊中立性規則撤廃により、ＩＳＰはより厳しい規制を受ける公益業ではなく、情報サービス業に分類される。 ＊筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。 ＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。 ,"

379,Deborah DSouza,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On July 17, Internet companies took part in a protest that was meant to highlight how the Federal Communications Commission chief Ajit Pai's proposal to remove net neutrality regulations would hurt consumers. The organizers of the ""Day of Action"" called net neutrality the basic principle that protects free speech on the internet. At the time, many thought that the FCC got the message, until Pai announced that the FCC would be holding a vote to roll back net neutrality rules on December 14, so here we go again. Since the word ""free"" often has a positive connotation, the other side hasn't wasted time calling for more freedom either. The FCC says its proposal is a step toward restoring internet freedom. A free and open internet is what internet service providers (ISPs) claim to want, too. For example, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) filed comments with the FCC detailing its support for the agency's commitment to ""restoring, protecting, and maintaining a free and open internet."" It looks like everyone wants the same thing. However, net neutrality opponents argue that the classification of ISPs as public utilities creates regulatory uncertainty, which stifles investment and innovation in the telecom industry. Pai says just the possibility of rate regulation prevents companies from investing in advanced networks because they are ""unsure of whether the government will let them compete in the free market."" Comcast calls the current rules an ""outdated regulatory regime"" that harms investment and innovation. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) worries about the scope of the government's authority and it wants policymakers to ""catalyze innovation"" and ""encourage investment."" AT&T Inc. (T) paints a bleak picture for an America under the current rules: ""Less broadband investment in turn means fewer jobs, lower productivity and lost opportunity, particularly in rural America where broadband investment is needed the most."" But has net neutrality really slowed down investment and innovation? As anyone who has dealt with statistics knows, it depends on whom you ask because the same data can be used to create different stories. Ajit Pai cites studies by the USTelecom Association and economist Hal Singer when he says that broadband capital spending has been decreasing after net neutrality. ""The key to realize our 5G future is to set rules that maximize investment in broadband,"" he said at the Mobile World Congress in February. Singer has previously prepared white papers and written testimony for AT&T and Verizon in the past, according to his bio on the Department of Justice website, and he is a principal at Economists Incorporated, which counts both those companies as clients. But the Internet Association, which counts giants like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) as members, cites studies that show spending by publicly traded telecom companies increased following net neutrality. What gives? For starters, in their respective calculations, USTelecom Association and Singer did not include Sprint’s leased-equipment capital investments – approximately $2 billion – and public interest group Free Press, whose study IA cited, said, ""That’s nonsense. Sprint purchasing and leasing smartphones is no different from cable companies purchasing and leasing set-top boxes, which USTA does count as investment."" The USTelecom Association and Singer also subtracted $2 billion from AT&T’s reported capital spending to account for the company’s acquisition of DirecTV and Mexican wireless operations. Free Press also notes that while AT&T and a few other publicly traded ISPs may have reduced spending after net neutrality, twice as many increased their investment levels. Pai also cited a study by Free State Foundation, a conservative think tank backed by the telecom industry, which said Title II net neutrality rules cost the U.S. $5.1 billion in broadband capital investment. A look at the methodology reveals it used USTelecom data, which includes the adjustments mentioned before, and established a trend line from 2003 to 2016 to calculate what broadband investment should have been. This is similar to a paper from George Ford, an economist at a D.C. think tank with anonymous donors that was cited by Comcast on its website. Ford wrote, ""the threat of reclassification reduced telecommunications investment by about 20% to 30%, or about $30 to $40 billion annually."" Ford's analysis is counterfactual: the period he looks at is from 2010, when the threat of net neutrality rules first emerged and then estimates what would have been the annual investment had there been no such threat. Comcast in its filing with the FCC said that paid prioritization would have uses in telemedicine and self-driving vehicles that may need to communicate with each other. The Verge pointed out that automated cars don't use broadband at all. They rely on the exchange of data wirelessly over an unlicensed spectrum called the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) band. Moreover, paid prioritization in telemedicine would mean low-income groups would lose its benefits. Since it is hard to quantify whether innovation has been depressed, the Internet Association has taken to using patent application statistics. The organization used government data from 2010 and 2012 to show a 58.4% increase in telecom patent applications at a time when federal regulators were looking to use the 2010 policy to protect net neutrality. Patents granted under code H04W or ""wireless communication networks"" increased 10.66%, and patents granted under H04L or ""transmission of digital information"" increased 5.25% in 2016 from the year before, according to IFI CLAIMS Patent Services.

380,Deborah DSouza,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On July 17, Internet companies took part in a protest that was meant to highlight how the Federal Communications Commission chief Ajit Pai's proposal to remove net neutrality regulations would hurt consumers. The organizers of the ""Day of Action"" called net neutrality the basic principle that protects free speech on the internet. At the time, many thought that the FCC got the message, until Pai announced that the FCC would be holding a vote to roll back net neutrality rules on December 14, so here we go again. Since the word ""free"" often has a positive connotation, the other side hasn't wasted time calling for more freedom either. The FCC says its proposal is a step toward restoring internet freedom. A free and open internet is what internet service providers (ISPs) claim to want, too. For example, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) filed comments with the FCC detailing its support for the agency's commitment to ""restoring, protecting, and maintaining a free and open internet."" It looks like everyone wants the same thing. However, net neutrality opponents argue that the classification of ISPs as public utilities creates regulatory uncertainty, which stifles investment and innovation in the telecom industry. Pai says just the possibility of rate regulation prevents companies from investing in advanced networks because they are ""unsure of whether the government will let them compete in the free market."" Comcast calls the current rules an ""outdated regulatory regime"" that harms investment and innovation. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) worries about the scope of the government's authority and it wants policymakers to ""catalyze innovation"" and ""encourage investment."" AT&T Inc. (T) paints a bleak picture for an America under the current rules: ""Less broadband investment in turn means fewer jobs, lower productivity and lost opportunity, particularly in rural America where broadband investment is needed the most."" But has net neutrality really slowed down investment and innovation? As anyone who has dealt with statistics knows, it depends on whom you ask because the same data can be used to create different stories. Ajit Pai cites studies by the USTelecom Association and economist Hal Singer when he says that broadband capital spending has been decreasing after net neutrality. ""The key to realize our 5G future is to set rules that maximize investment in broadband,"" he said at the Mobile World Congress in February. Singer has previously prepared white papers and written testimony for AT&T and Verizon in the past, according to his bio on the Department of Justice website, and he is a principal at Economists Incorporated, which counts both those companies as clients. But the Internet Association, which counts giants like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) as members, cites studies that show spending by publicly traded telecom companies increased following net neutrality. What gives? For starters, in their respective calculations, USTelecom Association and Singer did not include Sprint’s leased-equipment capital investments – approximately $2 billion – and public interest group Free Press, whose study IA cited, said, ""That’s nonsense. Sprint purchasing and leasing smartphones is no different from cable companies purchasing and leasing set-top boxes, which USTA does count as investment."" The USTelecom Association and Singer also subtracted $2 billion from AT&T’s reported capital spending to account for the company’s acquisition of DirecTV and Mexican wireless operations. Free Press also notes that while AT&T and a few other publicly traded ISPs may have reduced spending after net neutrality, twice as many increased their investment levels. Pai also cited a study by Free State Foundation, a conservative think tank backed by the telecom industry, which said Title II net neutrality rules cost the U.S. $5.1 billion in broadband capital investment. A look at the methodology reveals it used USTelecom data, which includes the adjustments mentioned before, and established a trend line from 2003 to 2016 to calculate what broadband investment should have been. This is similar to a paper from George Ford, an economist at a D.C. think tank with anonymous donors that was cited by Comcast on its website. Ford wrote, ""the threat of reclassification reduced telecommunications investment by about 20% to 30%, or about $30 to $40 billion annually."" Ford's analysis is counterfactual: the period he looks at is from 2010, when the threat of net neutrality rules first emerged and then estimates what would have been the annual investment had there been no such threat. Comcast in its filing with the FCC said that paid prioritization would have uses in telemedicine and self-driving vehicles that may need to communicate with each other. The Verge pointed out that automated cars don't use broadband at all. They rely on the exchange of data wirelessly over an unlicensed spectrum called the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) band. Moreover, paid prioritization in telemedicine would mean low-income groups would lose its benefits. Since it is hard to quantify whether innovation has been depressed, the Internet Association has taken to using patent application statistics. The organization used government data from 2010 and 2012 to show a 58.4% increase in telecom patent applications at a time when federal regulators were looking to use the 2010 policy to protect net neutrality. Patents granted under code H04W or ""wireless communication networks"" increased 10.66%, and patents granted under H04L or ""transmission of digital information"" increased 5.25% in 2016 from the year before, according to IFI CLAIMS Patent Services. AT&T was among the top 50 companies that received the most patents that year and also saw its patents increase from 2015. It seems like the government is determined to roll back net neutrality rules, and there's very little internet companies or consumers can do about it now. Although the FCC chair argues that net neutrality has led to lower investment, he is relying on industry consultants, think tanks and trade associations to make this claim, which certainly weakens his position. While it is possible ISPs may invest in more advanced networks if the rules are repealed, it is difficult to find evidence for this, and the companies have reportedly been telling investors they haven't affected investment. The greater question is at what and whose cost will net neutrality be rolled back? Investment in companies dependent on high speed internet is likely to drop if internet providers are free to discriminate between users, and MIT Technology Review has reported this has already begun.

385,Brian Stoffel,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Telecoms are the bread and butter of solid retirement portfolios. Because the capital requirements to building out nationwide networks are so onerous -- and the service these companies provide so necessary -- they make for protected money-printing machines once established. That means outsized dividends. The two communications companies we're focused on today, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL), have such payouts -- yielding 4.7% and 14.7%, respectively. For investors, it might seem like money actually is growing on trees. Image source: Getty Images. But which of these two is the better buy today? That's impossible to say with 100% certainty. But by comparing them on a series of three key aspects of their stocks, we can get a better idea of what we're getting when we buy shares. Here's how they stack up. If you're a long-term, buy-to-hold investor -- and that's what we think you should be here at the Motley Fool -- there's nothing more important to investigate than the sustainable competitive advantages -- otherwise known as ""moats."" In the most basic sense, a moat is what keeps customers coming back to you year after year while holding the competition at bay for decades. One key moat all telecoms benefit from is very high barriers to entry. Because of the costs associated with setting up a telecom company -- laying down the wire, building or leasing towers, etc. -- this isn't a terribly crowded field. But because both of these companies are already established, it really isn't a differentiator. Instead, we can simply look at market share and the different approaches each company is taking toward the future. According to Statista, Verizon is the largest wireless subscription provider in the United States, with a 35.7% share. In addition, the company is making moves to become a more robust media player. This includes the acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!. That gives Verizon more flexibility moving forward. CenturyLink, on the other hand, doesn't even move the needle on a nationwide scale when it comes to market share. Instead, its future is intertwined with the recently completed merger with Level3 communications. As a Tier One provider of internet services via this move, CenturyLink has become one of the largest internet providers in the country, helping it to secure a recent contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that sent shares soaring. In the end, it's too close to call a serious winner. As wireless contracts become progressively weaker, market share matters less for Verizon. And it's simply too early to tell if the Level3 merger will produce lasting and sustainable benefits for CenturyLink shareholders. Clearly, investors in these two companies would like to see any and all excess cash returned to them. But that's not the most prudent approach over the long run. That's because every business, at one point or another, is going to face difficult economic circumstances. Those with cash on hand can often emerge even stronger. This strength comes in three forms: being able to buy back shares on the cheap, acquiring distressed competitors, or -- most importantly -- outspending rivals or undercutting their prices to gain long-term market share. Here's how these two stack up in terms of financial fortitude, keeping in mind that Verizon is valued at 12 times the size of CenturyLink. Company Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Figures rounded to the nearest whole number. Net income and free cash flow presented on a trailing-12-month basis. While leverage is common in telecoms, CenturyLink's debt-to-cash ratio is eight times that of Verizon. That means that while a downturn wouldn't necessarily help either of these companies, CenturyLink would be far more vulnerable. Finally, we have the strange alchemy of valuation. While there's no one metric that can tell you how cheap or expensive a stock is, I like to consult several data points to get a more holistic picture. Here are four of my favorites when it comes to dividend payers. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Whether because of one-time events or not, I'm not a fan of either company with such high price-to-free cash flow ratios. Not only does it mean buying a company that's richly valued, but one that has paid out far more in dividends over the past 12 months than it has taken in. Overall, I consider both to have an unfavorable valuation, but CenturyLink's is more so given its sky-high payout ratio. So there you have it: I don't like either company very much, but I dislike Verizon less. I think there are better deals for you in the market, even if you're after high dividend payers. That's why I don't own either of these stocks nor have I indicated that they'll be outperformers in my own CAPS profile. ","

You read that right. In contrast to its previous live-streaming arrangement, which was exclusive to Verizon subscribers, Big Red's new deal applies to NFL viewers regardless of whether they're part of the Verizon network. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It seems likely that the terms of this agreement were heavily influenced by Yahoo, which Verizon acquired for $4.48 billion this past June then subsequently merged with its existing AOL business into a new media and tech brands subsidiary dubbed ""Oath."" This also means Verizon will lose its status as the country's exclusive mobile carrier for NFL games. But it's taking full advantage of its new reach. Through the new NFL partnership, Verizon will be able to live-stream all national preseason, regular-season, and playoff games, as well as the Super Bowl nationwide on its entire portfolio of digital and mobile media properties. That starts with the NFL playoffs next month on Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, and go90, as well as the NFL mobile app. According to Verizon, this means a prospective audience of over 200 million monthly unique mobile digital viewers in the United States. In addition, Verizon will work with individual NFL teams on ""Smart Stadium"" technology to improve stadium operations. It will also provide mobile access to NFL highlights, coverage of the league throughout the year, and ""a robust set of jointly developed original content."" ""We're making a commitment to fans for Verizon's family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,"" stated Verizon chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam. ""The NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it."" To be clear, financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. But according to anonymous sources speaking with Reuters, Verizon will pay roughly $2.25 billion to the NFL over the next five years for its new broad-reaching rights -- a princely ransom that more than doubles the estimated $1 billion price of its previous four-year deal. At the same time, that's nothing considering Verizon generated net income of $3.7 billion last quarter alone. And keeping in mind that Oath generated revenue of roughly $2 billion in Verizon's most recent quarter, as well as the fact that Yahoo turned profitable just prior to joining Verizon,  the company will also work to recoup its cost through incremental advertising. ""We believe that partnerships like this are a win for fans,"" elaborated McAdam, ""but also for partners and advertisers looking for a mobile-first experience."" In the end, one thing remains clear: This is an unmistakable bet by Verizon on the central role of mobile streaming as the future of sports viewership. And I think investors and football fans alike should be elated as Verizon paves the way to that end. ","

387,"Keith Noonan, Chris Neiger, and Daniel Miller",12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market at record highs, many investors are paying premiums for companies that appear capable of delivering big earnings growth over the long term. That sets them up with a potentially dangerous risk-reward dynamic. But you can still find growth stocks trading at significant discounts relative to their potential, if you know where to look. To give readers some leads on big growth opportunities that can be had on the cheap, we assembled a team of top Motley Fool investors and asked each one to profile a growth stock that they view as well worth the price of admission at current levels. Read on to see why they selected U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ:USCR), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UAA). Image source: Getty Images. Daniel Miller (U.S. Concrete): Finding growth stocks at deep value prices when markets have been consistently blowing through record highs is no simple task. However, in my view, U.S. Concrete fits that description. The company has bounced back from a 2010 bankruptcy and posted years of top- and bottom-line growth, but its market cap doesn't yet reflect its potential. USCR Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts After exiting bankruptcy protection and shedding its low-margin precast business, the company has been growing through bolt-on acquisitions -- a strategy it looks likely to continue using. Since 2014 alone, U.S. Concrete has completed 29 acquisitions in the ready-mixed concrete and aggregates space. Those new additions generated 40% of the company's adjusted EBITDA for the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30. This could prove to be a opportune time for investors to jump in. Management believes the country is still in the early innings of this construction cycle, and that the administration's regulatory and business-tax-cutting agendas, along with the possibility of increased federal infrastructure spending, could make the cycle more lucrative for companies in its segment. U.S. Concrete holds a top-three position in the markets where it does business, is a top supplier to major commercial projects in those regions, and has a successful track record of acquisitions. And most important for those seeking growth stocks at deep value prices, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15 (per Morningstar.com) makes U.S. Concrete worth a look. Chris Neiger (Verizon): Verizon is looking a little rough around the edges right now. The company's share price is down about 3% this year, compared the S&P 500's nearly 19% gains, and its stock is trading at just 14 times estimated forward earnings. Verizon lost ground to rivals T-Mobile and AT&T in part because they've made gains on wireless network speed and reliability, and also because it was late to offer unlimited plans when its competitors were jumping into them. But the telecom giant's management has worked to right this ship, even if its share price doesn't reflect the results yet. Its postpaid phone subscribership grew by 274,000 in the third quarter, and by 358,000 in the quarter before that. That's worth noting because in the U.S. telecom space, the only way a carriers can grow significantly is by stealing customers away from others. Verizon is also making the wise move of cutting $10 billion from its budget between now and 2021, which should result in a stronger balance sheet. That should help as the company focuses some effort on building out its content offerings via AOL and the recently acquired Yahoo!. The 50 or so content brands under its new subsidiary, called Oath, offer new opportunities for Verizon to grow beyond its wireless business. But even if its content hopes don't pan out quite as expected, investors should still be bullish on the telecom's wireless position (it still holds a 36% share of the subscription market) and its opportunity to grow that business with its new 5G technologies. The company has conducted 5G wireless tests across U.S. cities this year, and has plans to roll out fixed 5G broadbroad connections next year. Verizon doubtless aims to capitalize on its first-mover advantage in the 5G space as it did with its early investments in 4G and LTE, which kept the company ahead of its competitors in the past. This stock's performance may not have been pretty lately, but Verizon still has a strong core business, and it's making big moves in the next  evolution of wireless. Add in the company's content opportunities -- and its 4.7% dividend yield -- and the stock starts looking much more attractive. Keith Noonan (Under Armour): A market darling just a few years prior, Under Armour has fallen out of favor due to a slew of setbacks and challenges. Its North American growth story has hit the skids, and there are concerns that the brand simply isn't cool with young people anymore -- a terrifying prospect for a fashion-based business. Downward sales and earnings revisions have replaced management's touting of its former quarterly double-digit revenue growth streak -- a contextual backdrop that explains why shares lost more than 60% of their value over the last three years. That's a truncated version of Under Armour's current woes, but, for investors willing to shoulder some risk and stake out a contrarian position, its stock could present deep value at current prices. With its brand struggling amid a broader slowdown in the American sports apparel market, Under Armour's foreign growth is more important than ever. The good news is that the picture overseas looks pretty promising. Last quarter, international sales climbed roughly 56% year over year, and operating income climbed 64%. With the North American retail environment under pressure, the company is also focusing more on making direct-to-consumer sales online, and on reducing its operating expenses. Those initiatives should help keep earnings steady as the company broadens its global sales base. Under Armour shares are trading near their five-year lows. While the company's forward P/E of roughly 68 is steep, the company is valued at just 1.2 times its trailing 12-month sales. This stock could wind up looking quite cheap at current prices if the company continues to deliver big international growth. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) announced a $1.5 billion buyback on Wednesday morning. That $1.5 billion is well below what many analysts were expecting after T-Mobile's bid for Sprint fell through. Analysts' estimates for the buyback reached as high as $17 billion over three years. The current $1.5 billion authorization expires at the end of next year. But CFO Braxton Carter expects that $1.5 billion won't make it to the end of next year. T-Mobile is being very conservative with its authorization as it simply tests the waters. Carter expects T-Mobile to repurchase between 2% and 3% of shares outstanding with the authorization. In that same regard, COO Mike Sievert says management's focus is now on unlocking the value it accrued over the last five years of growth. That means a larger focus on free cash flow and capital returns, although there's not much interest in a dividend right now. Image source: T-Mobile. Significantly, T-Mobile isn't going to need to take on debt to fund its capital return program. It wouldn't make much sense if it did. Its credit rating still sits below investment grade at BB+, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, and net debt has creeped up to $27.5 billion from less than $20 billion after the first quarter last year. Carter noted it will ""delever organically,"" and management is aiming to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio of 3 to 4. T-Mobile expects free cash flow to greatly surpass the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization next year. It's already brought in $1.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2017. By 2019, management expects to produce about $4.5 billion in free cash flow. That's more than enough to support $1.5 billion returned to shareholders. T-Mobile expects its free cash flow to increase between 45% and 48% per year in 2018 and 2019. Investors don't expect that rate to slow too much in the next decade, either. Rapidly increasing free cash flow, as a result of greater scale and lower investment needs, should provide much more room to increase the share repurchase authorization. T-Mobile should produce over $3 billion in free cash flow next year based on its outlook for 45% to 48% compound annual growth through 2019. So it's going to return less than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. For reference, AT&T paid out over 70% of its free cash flow as dividends. It's slowed its repurchasing activity since going on an acquisition spree. Verizon Communications paid out more than 80% of free cash flow as a dividend last quarter. It's also authorized to buy back 100 million shares by 2020, which is currently about $5 billion. Granted, AT&T and Verizon are generating significantly more cash flow than T-Mobile at this point in time. But with the company's biggest investments in its network and retail footprint slowing down and its customer base continuing to grow, free cash flow should have several more years of strong growth. The excess cash flow can go right back to shareholders as T-Mobile morphs from a growth company to a cash flow story. As such, the capital returns ought to significantly outpace the growth in free cash flow, which is already expected to boom. ","
      
    A $1.5 Billion Buyback Is Just the Start for T-Mobile -- The Motley Fool

389,Leo Sun,12142017,Fool,12072017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. 2017 was a dismal year for AT&T (NYSE:T) investors, who watched their stock drop 14% as the S&P 500 rallied 17%. The stock was weighed down by four straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines and ongoing losses in video subscribers. Analysts expect AT&T to finish fiscal 2017 with a 2% sales decline and 3% earnings growth. For 2018, both figures are expected to stay roughly flat. This doesn't make AT&T look like an exciting investment for the foreseeable future, but investors shouldn't overlook the four big moves that it will likely make next year. Image source: AT&T. AT&T is already America's second largest wireless carrier, top wireline services provider, and biggest pay TV provider thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If it closes its planned $85 billion takeover of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. The merger would introduce major bundling opportunities between its wireline, wireless, video streaming, and pay TV businesses. Those bundles could help AT&T counter cord cutters at its pay TV business, widen its moat against Netflix, and lock in more wireless customers. AT&T claims that the acquisition would become accretive to its adjusted earnings and free cash flow within the first year. However, the US Department of Justice recently sued to block the merger, on the grounds that it would create an anti-competitive ecosystem which would limit consumer choices and hurt streaming video providers. AT&T's top priority for 2018 will be to clear these regulatory hurdles and seal the deal. If it fails to do so, its stock could stumble. AT&T will also invest heavily in new towers to expand its pre-5G and 5G network capabilities across the 700 MHz, AWS-3, and WCS spectrums. Earlier this year, Barclays estimated that AT&T would deploy equipment on up to 50,000 towers, and build about 2,000 more new towers to upgrade its infrastructure and launch the FirstNet public safety network. AT&T also recently teamed up with Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in a joint partnership with Tillman Infrastructure to build hundreds of new towers. Verizon has also been aggressively expanding its fiber assets -- via its purchases of Straight Path and XO Communications for nearly $5 billion -- ahead of its 5G fixed broadband rollout next year. AT&T's acquisitions of spectrum licenses, DirecTV, and Time Warner are causing its debt levels to skyrocket. Its long-term debt hit $154.7 billion last quarter, up from $113.7 billion at the end of 2016. If the Time Warner deal closes, that figure could rise above $180 billion. AT&T has already been selling various non-core assets -- including certain cell towers, wireline operations, and data centers -- to extinguish some debt. But AT&T will likely need to sell more assets to further reduce that figure. Two possible divestments include its Digital Life home security business, which could net $1 billion in a sale, and its Latin American pay TV assets (excluding Mexico), which could be sold for $8 billion. It might also consider selling CNN to gain regulatory approval for the Time Warner deal. AT&T added three million wireless subscriptions (2.3 million in the US and nearly 700,000 in Mexico) last quarter. However, a growing number of those new subscriptions aren't for smartphones -- they're used to link tablets, wearables, drones, and connected cars to the internet with stand-alone connections. AT&T stated that it connected almost 100,000 vehicles last quarter, and that the auto market represented a ""real opportunity"" as infotainment and navigation devices rely more heavily on constant connections. AT&T's growth across these markets could diversify its business away from the saturated smartphone market. AT&T, like many of its telco rivals, will try to expand its digital ecosystem, upgrade its infrastructure, reach new wireless markets, and reduce its debt in 2018. That's a tough balancing act to pull off. However, AT&T's stock remains cheap at 13 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward dividend yield of 5.3%. Therefore, investors looking for a cheap income play could consider buying this beaten-down stock -- as long they don't expect a big rebound over the next few quarters. ","
      
    What to Expect From AT&T, Inc. in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. One of the many benefits of owning stocks is the chance to receive small chunks of a company's profit in the form of regular checks. We're talking about dividends, of course, and a great many companies pay them every quarter. Dividend policies are not set in stone, though, so there's no guarantee that a particular company will keep shoveling them into shareholders' hands. Image source: Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is about much more than its namesake sugary drink. In fact, the company produces 21 brands with over $1 billion in annual worldwide sales. With that kind of volume, Coca-Cola can't help but make loads of money -- its net profit margin nearly always lands well in double-digit percentage territory, while it rakes in billions of dollars in cash flow every year. Although it's struggled a bit lately due to a shift in consumer preferences toward healthier products, the company is still immensely profitable. Coca-Cola is one of the all-time dividend champions, having raised its payout at least once every year for 55 years in a row. Image source: McDonald's. Elsewhere in big food and beverage, classic fast-food purveyor McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) regularly serves up a quarterly dividend in addition to its Big Macs and shakes. Similar to Coca-Cola, the company struggled in the wake of the healthier-eating trend earlier this decade. However, McDonald's seems to have rediscovered its mojo, delivering strong sales and earnings growth with popular new offerings -- all-day breakfast, for example, and sensible efficiency measures like kiosk ordering. McDonald's is famous for utilizing the franchise model, and most of the company's restaurants are managed in this way. This keeps profit margins relatively high for the company and provides plenty of cash for the shareholder payout, which was recently extended to 41 consecutive years with a 7% increase. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Unlike Coke and McDonald's, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) isn't necessarily a household name among American consumers. But it's a big part of their lives, as the consumer-goods giant controls a great many brands that we find throughout the house. This product lineup includes, but is nowhere near limited to, Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razors and accessories, and Pampers diapers. In recent years, Procter & Gamble has slimmed this selection a bit, jettisoning a host of underperforming brands. This hasn't yet resulted in meaningful bottom-line improvement, and cash flow has narrowed. Regardless, the company still has a significant presence in stores and possesses more than enough money to pay its shareholders. It's got one of the longest dividend-raise streaks on the market, having boosted its payout 61 years in a row. Image source: Lowe's. A vibrant housing market is supporting the business of home-improvement stores, few moreso than Lowe's (NYSE:LOW). In fiscal 2016, the company booked $65 billion in sales, for growth of over 10% year over year. More impressively, net income rose 21%, to hit nearly $3.1 billion. Americans are getting out their hammers and building things, a trend that very much favors a big home-improvement chain like Lowe's. Lowe's has paid a dividend in every single quarter since it listed on the stock exchange in 1961. Its dividend-raise habit stretches back nearly as far -- 54 years, to be exact. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) likes to boast that it passes its savings onto its customers. Another thing the company is fond of handing over is a quarterly dividend to shareholders: These days, it doles out $0.51 per share. The company has done fairly well, considering that online shopping is taking a toll on traditional retailers like itself. In recent years, neither revenue nor net profit has eroded too badly, and Wal-Mart still has plenty of cash on hand for the payout. In fiscal 2017, for example, its total spend on the dividend was less than 50% of its earnings. With a dividend-raise streak that's now 44 years long, Wal-Mart is one of the most durable raisers in the retail industry. Image source: Target. Elsewhere in big retail, Target (NYSE:TGT) also is holding its own against the onslaught of e-tailers. What helps is that the company makes a great effort to lure customers into its stores. A recent initiative, known as Drive Up, is currently being tested in Minnesota. Drive Up would allow Target shoppers to make their purchase online and pick up the goods at a designated area at the store. The service, which is currently being tested, is appealing for people within range of a store who don't want to wait a day, or several, for an e-tailer to ship them their purchases. Target has one of the highest-yielding dividends in the retail sector, at 4.4%. Like Wal-Mart, the company has a four-decade-plus stretch of annual dividend increases. Image source: Costco Wholesale. Our dividend-paying retailer tour stops at the entrance of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), the popular warehouse club. The company seems to be barely struggling at all against e-tailing, perhaps because customers can best discover deals and funky products by actually visiting the store. In its most recently reported fiscal year, Costco booked almost $130 billion in sales -- a pleasant 9% improvement over the previous year -- while net profit rose by 11%. There are few signs of the dreaded retail apocalypse at this retailer. In April, Costco declared an 11% raise in its regular quarterly dividend, to $0.50 per share. It has hiked its payout every year since 2005. Image source: Tootsie Roll Industries. Nearly every American is familiar with Tootsie Roll candy, but many are unaware that the company behind it -- Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) -- owns a host of confectionery brands. Among these are DOTS, Junior Mints, and Charleston Chew. This concentration on sugary goods doesn't fit into the healthy eating/drinking trend (see slide No. 1), and Tootsie Roll Industries has seen revenue declines because of it. Still, the company's wares are common sights on supermarket and convenience-store shelves -- one reason it's been consistently profitable. For over half a century, Tootsie Roll has been raising its dividend as reliably as it's produced those tasty pellets of chewy chocolate. At present, that quarterly payout amounts to $0.09 per share. Image source: Getty Images. A vibrant U.S. housing market is thickening the financials of paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), which has been doing its thing since 1866. Not long ago, the company decided to bulk up through the splashy, $11 billion buyout of fellow paint manufacturer Valspar, a deal that closed earlier this year. This bolt-on acquisition helped Sherwin-Williams grow its revenue an impressive 37% on a year-over-year basis in its Q3. Meanwhile, cost savings from operational overlap should help the company improve its already healthy profitability. Sherwin-Williams is a longtime dividend payer and raiser. It began lifting its payout way back in 1979, and hasn't stopped yet. Image source: Aflac. Perhaps best known for its duck mascot and quirky TV ads, Aflac (NYSE:AFL) is a leading provider of supplemental health insurance. This is a niche, yet profitable, segment, as evidenced by the company's habit of landing consistently in the black. Aflac operates in two highly developed markets, the U.S. and Japan, and currency movements in the latter can affect results at times -- such as the company's Q3, in which it saw a slight dip in revenue. For the most part, though, Aflac operates a very stable and steady business. This is reflected in the company's quarterly dividend, which has been on the rise for over 30 years straight. On an annual basis, Aflac currently pays $1.80, which yields 2.1%. Image source: ExxonMobil. The largest oil producer in the U.S., mighty ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has managed to keep itself well in the black on the bottom line lately, despite a serious drop in oil prices earlier this decade. ExxonMobil has done a good job maintaining profitability: In its latest reported quarter, it took advantage of recent improvements in prices and expanded its bottom line by almost 50%, to just under $4 billion, on $66.2 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's cash flow remains more than sufficient to pay its steadily increasing dividend. Said payout has been flowing through the pipes of ExxonMobil and its predecessor companies for over a century. More recently, the company has increased it annually for 35 years running. Image source: McCormick. This dividend cleverly hides in your pantry or spice rack. If any company is most readily identified with spices and food seasonings, it's longtime purveyor McCormick (NYSE:MKC), which has a commanding presence on supermarket shelves. Over the years, the company has managed to build itself into a powerhouse, with over $4.4 billion in annual sales, and its organic improvements have been complimented by acquisitions. Its revenue growth tends to outpace the rise in its costs, making it a steady and reliably profitable operator. McCormick just declared a raise in its quarterly dividend -- by 11%, to $0.52 per share -- marking the 32nd year in a row it has increased its payout. Image source: Waste Management. Take out your trash and collect a dividend. That's the interesting dynamic at work if you're a customer and shareholder of top U.S. rubbish-hauler Waste Management (NYSE:WM), which makes a lot of coin disposing of unwanted material. The company has been in business in its present form since 1968 and has grown to the point where it books nearly $14 billion in annual revenue. It's almost always profitable on an annual basis, and throws off more-than-enough cash to fund its dividend. Said payout has been headed north for over a decade: Waste Management has increased it every year since 2004. Image source: Microsoft. Generally speaking, tech companies aren't generous dividend payers -- when they pay them at all, that is. The sector requires a great deal of investment in order to bring products to market, which usually doesn't leave much for shareholder payouts. A notable exception is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a famously profitable and cash-rich company that started to hand out a quarterly dividend in 2004 and has never looked back. It's lifted that distribution every year since then, boosting it from the initial $0.08 per share to today's $0.39. Although some critics have faulted Microsoft for not being more generous with the payout, at 2%, it actually yields slightly over the average of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. Image source: Getty Images. The largest American cellphone-services provider by subscriber count, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is also one of the sector's most reliable dividend payers. Although the company sets aside plenty of capital for investments into its network and infrastructure, it also leaves enough room for a generous shareholder payout. There's enough money for a great many purposes, as Verizon's trailing 12-month net profit amounted to nearly $16 billion, almost twice what the carrier paid out in dividends. Although it doesn't have the longest annual raise streak in its segment -- that honor goes to uber-rival AT&T -- Verizon has had a good run with its increases. In June it declared a raise for the 11th year in a row. ","

392,,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted along party lines on Thursday to repeal landmark 2015 rules aimed at ensuring a free and open internet, setting up a court fight over a move that could recast the digital landscape. The approval of FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal in a 3-2 vote marked a victory for internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and hands them power over what content consumers can access. It also is the biggest win for Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations since taking over at the agency in January. Democrats, Hollywood and companies such as Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc had urged Pai, a Republican appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to keep the Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain content. The new rules give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but must have new transparency requirements that will require them to disclose any changes to consumers. The meeting, held amid protests online and in front of the FCC headquarters in Washington, was evacuated before the vote for about 10 minutes due to an unspecified security threat, and resumed after law enforcement with sniffer dogs checked the room. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the  administration “supports the FCC’s efforts. At the same time, the White House certainly has and always will support a free and fair internet.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal. Shares of Alphabet, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp moved lower after the vote. The FCC said the rules would take effect in a few months after the White House Office of Management and Budget formally approves them. Pai has argued that the 2015 rules were heavy handed and stifled competition and innovation among service providers. “The internet wasn’t broken in 2015. We weren’t living in a digital dystopia,” he said on Thursday. Consumers are unlikely to see immediate changes but smaller startups worry the lack of restrictions could drive up costs or lead to their content being blocked. Internet service providers say they will not block or throttle legal content but may engage in paid prioritization. They argue that the largely unregulated internet functioned well in the two decades before the 2015 order. Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly noted that self-driving vehicles and remotely monitored medical procedures may require internet service and that their needs could be given priority “over cat videos.” O’Rielly said it is unlikely any internet provider would voluntarily submit to a “PR nightmare” by “attempting to engage in blocking, throttling or improper discrimination. It is simply not worth the reputation cost.” Still, Democrats have pointed to polls showing a repeal is deeply unpopular and say they will prevail in protecting the rules, either in the courts or in U.S. Congress. Immediately after the vote, Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, said he and 15 other senators planned to introduce a resolution to undo the FCC action and restore the net neutrality rules. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said in a written dissent released on Thursday that the decision grants internet providers “extraordinary new power” from the FCC. “They have the technical ability and business incentive to discriminate and manipulate your internet traffic,” she said. “And now this agency gives them the legal green light to go ahead.” Several state attorneys general said before the vote they would oppose the ruling, citing issues with the public comment period. Other critics have said they will consider challenging what they see as weaker enforcement. The 2015 rules were intended to give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband providers from favoring their own content. Those practices are now allowed as long as they are disclosed. The broadband industry cheered the move. USTelecom, a lobbying group representing internet providers and broadband companies said after the vote they had “renewed confidence” to make network investments, particularly in rural communities. On the other side, the trade group Internet Association, whose members include content providers Alphabet, Facebook and Pandora Media Inc, said “the fight isn’t over” and that it was weighing legal options in a lawsuit against the FCC order. A University of Maryland poll had found more than 80 percent of respondents opposed a repeal. The survey of 1,077 registered voters was conducted online by the Program for Public Consultation from Dec. 6-8. ","

393,,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Behind your video stream of a hit like “Stranger Things” is a complicated array of technology and business relationships that will not change very much, at least in the short term, as a result of this week’s repeal of U.S. regulations on internet traffic, industry insiders say. The latest net neutrality rules did not erase these business dynamics, people familiar with the arrangements say. The repeal likely will not either, though scuffles could arise as ISPs seek to take advantage of the rule change in the future. “From the era of having no net neutrality to the era of having it, nothing changed,” said a former video streaming executive on condition of anonymity. To deliver their services effectively and economically, large video streaming companies spend money sending data directly to different broadband networks, and dominant ISPs at times charge for taking on large volumes of traffic. Companies’ “need for someone that sits between their content, whether that’s a website or streaming video, and all the places in the world it needs to go, isn’t going to change,” said Sunil Dhaliwal, founder of venture capital firm Amplify Partners, which has a stake in content delivery network Fastly. There have been conflicts, notably a 2014 dust-up between Netflix and Comcast, that resulted from the dramatic surge in streaming video traffic in recent years. Netflix ultimately agreed to pay Comcast despite complaining in an online blog post that its partner was “double dipping” by also receiving money from home internet subscribers. Yet this arrangement was not unique. YouTube, for example, has also paid ISPs as part of so-called “peering” arrangements by which networks connect to one another to deliver video streams more efficiently, said an industry executive familiar with the practice. In a statement, Netflix said “tolls decreased for us” after the 2015 net neutrality rules were passed - but did not say they disappeared. The company added: “We support strong net neutrality protections, even if we are at less risk because of our popularity, which keeps our relationships with ISPs stable.” Chris Van Noy, a digital media executive formerly with Akamai and streaming service Hulu, noted that ISPs would have no reason to interfere with startups and small firms that send little internet traffic over their networks, with the possible exception of a startup posing a strategic threat. Going after bigger players would not be simple either, he said. “It’s always a tight rope for the ISPs,” said Van Noy. Blocking video services would undermine their sales of fast-download, higher-margin internet plans that are “pure gravy for them.” That is not to say ISPs will not attempt to profit from the regulatory change. They may offer bundled internet deals that include their in-house content but charge extra for Netflix or Hulu, experts said. “They can frame it as a positive. ‘We’re not hurting Netflix. We’re just giving our subscribers a benefit of something we already own,’” said Alan Wolk, lead analyst for TV industry publication TV[R]EV. But any action that changes how consumers access the internet must be disclosed under the new FCC rules and may face regulatory scrutiny - a possible deterrent. “I don’t think anyone is going to do anything crazy that will upset public opinion,” said Eric Hippeau, a managing partner of Lerer Hippeau Ventures and former CEO of The Huffington Post. “This is a highly politically charged area.” ","

394,,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017 with the market’s worst performers, including Under Armour and General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds. As investment advisors rebalance clients’ portfolios in the final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor with analysts - can be self-destructive. With the S&P 500’s rally pushing price/earnings multiples to highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own technology and other high-growth stocks may attract bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017. “A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have a good year,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year average of 27. “Grocery is local; it’s not an internet play. And Kroger has the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,” Dollarhide said. Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P 500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to finish 2017 with annual increases above the index’s 20-perent gain. 2017's diamonds and lumps of coal: tmsnrt.rs/2BhvwkC ","

395,,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'B'/'RR4' rating to Windstream Services, LLC's new 8.75% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2024. The new 2024 notes are pari passu to the company's existing unsecured notes and are being issued in exchange for a portion of 7.75% senior notes due 2021 and 7.50% senior notes due 2022. On Dec.12, 2017, Windstream announced results for debt exchange offers announced on Nov. 28, 2017. Approximately 86% ($538 million) and 85% ($232 million) of 2021 and 2022 noteholders, respectively, have accepted the exchange offers as of the early settlement date. The debt exchanges would entail higher incremental interest cost for Windstream, but the lower maturity wall in the intermediate term would help improve the liquidity position. The new 2024 notes are subject to a mandatory redemption of $150 million, 75 days after the initial settlement date. The covenants restrict payments to the parent, Windstream Holdings, Inc., if leverage is equal or greater than 3.5x, with carve-outs for master lease payments by parent to Uniti Group Inc. and certain administrative and tax payments. Windstream also announced 2023 exchange offer, where it offered to exchange 7.50% senior notes due 2023 for 6 3/8% notes maturing in 2023. As of the early settlement date, 57% ($68 million in aggregate principal) of the note holders had tendered to exchange, lower than the minimum $90 million required per 2023 exchange conditions. The company has extended the deadline until Dec. 26, 2017. Windstream's ratings are on Negative Watch after the company received a notice of default from Aurelius Capital Master Ltd., a noteholder on its 6 3/8% bonds. Windstream is defending the allegations and has filed a legal proceeding on the matter. Windstream has obtained the consent solicitations for waiver of the alleged defaults from a majority of 6 3/8% noteholders. Fitch will resolve the Watch following the resolution of the pending litigation. KEY RATING DRIVERS Near-Term Pressures: Including the EarthLink merger and Broadview Networks acquisition (the transactions), Windstream continued to experience pressure in its wholesale segment, as well as the small/medium business incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) segment through the third quarter of 2017 (3Q17). The enterprise segment remains weak due to effects of legacy revenue declines. Competitive local exchange (CLEC) consumer and small business has shown stabilization in 3Q17, benefitting from acquisition-related segment revenue. Pro forma for the transactions, Fitch's base case assumes revenues continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. Revenue Mix Changes: Windstream derives approximately two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise services, consumer high-speed internet services and its carrier customers (core and wholesale), providing the best prospects for stable revenues in the long term. Certain legacy revenues remain pressured, but Windstream's revenues should stabilize gradually as legacy revenues dwindle in the mix. Leverage Metrics: Fitch estimates total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be 5.8x in 2017, including the transactions. Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. In calculating total adjusted debt, Fitch applies an 8x multiple to the sum of the annual rental payment to Uniti plus other rental expenses. Cost Synergies Support EBITDA Stabilization: Windstream anticipates realizing more than $180 million of annual run-rate synergies three years after the close of the transactions: $155 million in operating cost savings and $25 million in capital spending savings. Windstream expects to realize approximately $180 million in run-rate synergies by the end of 2019. In its base case assumptions for Windstream, Fitch has assumed moderately lower cost savings to be realized by the end of three years following the transactions. Fitch expects EBITDAR margin improvement in the range of 100bps-200bps by the end of 2019. Integration Key to Success: Fitch believes there are potential execution risks to achieving the operating cost and capital expenditure synergies following the close of the transactions. Initial savings are expected to be realized from reduced selling, general and administrative savings as corporate overheads and other public company cost savings arise. Over time, the company is expected to realize the benefits of lower network access costs as on-network opportunities lower third-party network access costs. Finally, cost savings are expected to be realized by IT and the billing system. Fitch estimated $20 million of these savings in 4Q17. DERIVATION SUMMARY Windstream has a weaker competitive position based on scale and size of its operations in the higher-margin enterprise market. Larger companies, including AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable), and CenturyLink, Inc. (BB/Stable), have an advantage with national or multinational companies given their extensive footprints in the U.S. and abroad. In comparison to Windstream, AT&T and Verizon maintain lower financial leverage, generate higher EBITDA margins and FCF, and have wireless offerings that provide more service diversification. Fitch also believes Windstream has a weaker FCF profile than CenturyLink including the LVLT acquisition, as CenturyLink's FCF will benefit from enhanced scale and LVLT's net operating loss carryforwards. Although Windstream has less exposure to the more volatile residential market compared to its wireline peer, Frontier Communications Corp. (B+/Stable), it has higher leverage than Frontier. Within the residential market, incumbent wireline providers face wireless substitution and competition from cable operators with facilities-based triple play offerings, including Comcast Corp. (A-/Stable) and Charter Communications Inc. (Fitch rates Charter's indirect subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC, BB+/Stable). Cheaper alternative offerings such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) video services provide additional challenges. Incumbent wireline providers have had modest success with bundling broadband and satellite video service offerings in response to these threats. As of year-end 2016, roughly 60% of Windstream's footprint overlapped with a national cable operator. No country-ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects impact the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue and EBITDA include the EarthLink merger as of Feb. 27, 2017 and the acquisition of Broadview on July 28, 2017. --Revenues total $5.9 billion for 2017 and remain almost flat in 2018. Fitch expects organic revenue to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, albeit at a slowing pace. --2017 EBITDA is expected to benefit from synergies achieved from acquisitions and other cost savings. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to expand by roughly 70bps in 2018 as additional cost synergies are realized. --Fitch expects total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will decline from 5.8x at year-end 2017 to the mid-5x range by the end of 2019 as cost synergies are realized from both transactions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --The company sustains total adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 5.0x-5.2x. --Revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize on a sustained basis. --Fitch would also need to see progress by Windstream on executing the integration of its recent transactions. --Material reduction in leverage on a sustained basis following any asset sales repayment of debt could also benefit the rating. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 6.0-6.2x or higher for a sustained period. --The company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability due to competitive and business conditions. --Evidence of deterioration in liquidity, including lack of positive run-rate FCFs and declining FCF margin. --Any negative developments related to the outcome of the receipt of notice of default. Fitch intends to resolve the Rating Watch once it can be sufficiently determined that the allegations under the notice will not affect Windstream's credit profile. LIQUIDITY The rating is supported by the liquidity provided by Windstream's $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). At Sept. 30, 2017, approximately $129 million was available (pro forma for the recently completed debt exchanges, approximately $410 million is available under the revolver). The revolver availability was supplemented with $56.5 million in cash at the end of 3Q17. The $1.25 billion senior secured RCF is in place until April 2020. Principal financial covenants in Windstream's secured credit facilities require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75x and a maximum leverage ratio of 4.5x. Outside of annual term loan amortization payments, Windstream does not have any material maturities until 2020. The recent debt exchanges helped Windstream extend the maturities, improving the liquidity profile. Windstream utilized the proceeds from new money 2025 senior secured notes to repay $250 million under the revolver and $140 million under term loan tranche B6. Pro forma for the debt exchanges, and repayment of revolver, maturities in 2020 total approximately $1.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2017. Fitch estimates post-dividend FCF in 2017 will range from negative $100 to negative $200 million, including integration capex, $50 million of spending related to the completion of Project Excel and other cash non-operating expenses. Fitch expects capital spending to return to normal levels in the 13%-15% range after 2017 and for the company to return to positive FCF in 2018, with FCF margins in the low single digits over the forecast. RECOVERY The recovery analysis assumes that Windstream would be considered a going concern in a bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated. Fitch has assumed a 10% administrative claim. Windstream's going concern EBITDA is based on LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017, pro forma for acquisitions and synergies. The going-concern EBITDA estimate reflects Fitch's view of a sustainable, post-reorganization EBITDA level, upon which Fitch bases the valuation of the company. A lower going-concern EBITDA factors in the competitive dynamics of the industry that result in account losses and pricing pressures. The overall decline also considers Windstream's cost cutting efforts as an offsetting factor. This leads to a post-reorganization EBITDA estimate of approximately $1.2 billion that is 20% below pro forma LTM EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2017. The current network lease with Uniti is expected to remain unchanged. An EV multiple of 4.5x is used to calculate a post-reorganization valuation. Comparable market multiples in the industry range from 5.4x-8.7x and recent acquisition multiples range from 3.8x-6.6x. There are two bankruptcy cases analyzed in Fitch's TMT bankruptcy case study report - Fairpoint and Hawaiian Telecom - both of which filed bankruptcy in 2008 and emerged with multiplies of 4.6x and 3.7x, respectively. Both were also sold in recent acquisitions for 5.9x and 5.6x. The recovery multiple takes into account Windstream's weaker competitive position in the industry and the company's exposure to legacy assets. Fitch's multiple for Windstream's recovery analysis also considers dependence on legacy revenues that will decline in future, aided by revenue from recent acquisitions in cloud and connectivity space. The revolving facility is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The waterfall analysis results in a 100% recovery corresponding to a 'RR1' Recovery Rating for the secured debt including the first-lien credit facility and revolving facility; and the newly issued senior secured notes. The senior secured tranche of Windstream's capital structure benefits from a first-priority lien on all assets and capital stock of its subsidiaries (subject to regulatory approval) and a guaranty from Windstream's material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (except for subsidiaries of PAETEC Holding Corp and subject to regulatory approval). The waterfall also indicates an 'RR4' (41%) recovery for senior unsecured notes. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has maintained the following ratings: Windstream Services, LLC --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B'; --$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2020 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured term loans at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior secured notes due 2025 at 'BB/RR1'; -- Senior unsecured notes at 'B/RR4'. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative. Contact: Primary Analyst Salonie Sehgal Associate Director +1-312-368-3137 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

396,,12212017,Reuters,12142017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - La Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones de Estados Unidos votó el jueves en favor de rechazar las históricas reglas aprobadas en 2015 para asegurar un internet libre y abierto, poniendo en marcha un pulso judicial por una decisión que podría redibujar el panorama digital. La aprobación de la propuesta del presidente a la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC por sus siglas en inglés), Ajit Pai, significó una victoria para proveedores de servicios en internet como AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp y Verizon Communications Inc, ya que les da poder sobre los contenidos a los que pueden acceder los consumidores. Los demócratas, Hollywood y compañías como Alphabet Inc -matriz de Google- y Facebook Inc habían pedido a Pai, un republicano nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump, que mantuviera el reglamento de tiempos de Barack Obama, que prohíbe a los proveedores de servicios bloquear, ralentizar el acceso o cobrar más por determinados contenidos. Asociaciones de defensa de los consumidores y grupos comerciales que representan a proveedores de contenidos planean poner en marcha un reto legal para preservar estas reglas. La reunión fue evacuada durante unos 10 minutos antes de la votación, debido a una amenaza de seguridad no especificada, y se reanudó después de que perros entrenados revisaron la sala. La demócrata Mignon Clyburn, comisionada de la FCC, dijo antes de la votación que los republicanos están “entregando las llaves de Internet” a “un puñado de corporaciones multimillonarias”. Pai argumentó que la legislación de 2015 es muy dura y complica la competencia y la innovación entre los prestadores de servicios. Los miembros de la FCC votaron por 3-2 en favor de rechazar las reglas, en línea con sus partidos afines. Los proveedores de servicios por internet aseguran que no bloquearán ni acelerarán contenido legal, aunque sí podrían optar por una priorización pagada. Asimismo, aseguran que los consumidores no experimentarán cambios y argumentan que internet funcionó bien en las dos décadas previas a la orden de 2015, cuando estaba bastante desregulado. ","

398,,12212017,Reuters,12142017,ネット通信を巡る環境は、ＦＣＣが中立性規則導入に合意した２年前から劇的に変わろうとしている。パイＦＣＣ委員長が主導してきた中立性規則撤廃により、ネット接続事業者（ＩＳＰ）は特定コンテンツへのアクセス遮断や速度制限、ないしは消費者への料金上乗せといった行為が禁止されなくなる。今後ＩＳＰは公益業ではなく、より監督が緩い情報サービス業に分類されるからだ。 来年初めから実施される中立性規則撤廃は、ＩＳＰがアクセス遮断や速度制限をする場合は、その情報を開示することが前提となる。各企業の情報開示が正確かどうか監視し、正確性を確保する任務は連邦取引委員会（ＦＴＣ）が担う。 ＦＣＣは２０１５年にネット中立規則をまとめ上げる前、２つの業界から起こされた訴訟で敗北した。昨年には連邦控訴裁が、ネット中立性規則の正当性を支持した一方、ＩＳＰの具体的な分類はＦＣＣの権限に属するとの見解を示した。 このように司法判断が揺れ動いているため、議会にもネット通信規則のあり方をはっきり定めろという圧力がかかっている。マイク・コフマン下院議員のような一部の共和党員さえ、議会が関連法案を策定するまでＦＣＣに中立性規則撤廃案の採決を待ってほしいと要請した。上院では共和党のジョン・スーン商業科学運輸委員長がこの問題に取り組んでいるところだ。 １４日のＦＣＣの採決でパイ氏とともに中立性規則撤廃に賛成したマイケル・オライリー委員は、恐らく議会だけが白黒をつけて、決まったことを恒久化できると発言した。それまでネット規制を巡る情勢はしばらく曲折があるだろう。 ●背景となるニュース ＊ＦＣＣは１４日の採決で、２０１５年に導入したネット中立性規則撤廃を正式承認した。５人の委員のうち、パイ委員長を含めた共和党の３人が賛成した。 ＊中立性規則撤廃により、ＩＳＰはより厳しい規制を受ける公益業ではなく、情報サービス業に分類される。 ＊筆者は「Reuters Breakingviews」のコラムニストです。本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。 ＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。 ,"

399,Daniel Liberto,12212017,Investopedia,12142017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs China’s biggest smartphone manufacturers are keen to take on Apple Inc. (APPL) in the U.S. after comfortably beating the iPhone maker in their home market, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. are believed to be in talks with U.S. wireless operators about selling their flagship smartphones to American consumers as early as next year. The sources said both companies are negotiating with the likes of AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) two of the largest U.S. wireless networks. Talks are reportedly going well, although an agreement could still fail to materialize, the sources added. If Huawei and Xiaomi are successful in their negotiations, they will suddenly find themselves in an ideal position to challenge Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.’s (SSNLF) hierarchy in the U.S. With the support of carriers, who are responsible for most phone purchases, both companies will be able to extend their presence beyond e-commerce websites to retail stores, carrier websites and TV commercials, reaching millions of new potential customers in the process. Bloomberg’s sources said Huawei, China’s number one phone maker, is keen to sell its flagship line via U.S. carriers, alongside ecommerce channels. Meanwhile, Xiaomi is rumored to be growing frustrated with negotiations and, as a result, is now weighing up whether to start opening its own retail stores in the U.S. The decision by China’s biggest smartphone makers to enter the U.S. market at this particular time makes sense. Since moving toward financing plans, the country’s carriers have stopped subsidizing handsets, making cheaper models more attractive. Apple has emerged as one of the biggest victims of these changes because its phones tend to cost more. Without discounts from carriers, consumers are now having to pay the full price for the iPhone X. While Apple’s latest flagship model retails for over $1,000, Chinese rivals sell handsets at much more affordable prices. The affordability of Huawei and Xiaomi’s phones is one of the main reasons why they continue to beat Apple in their home market. According to IDC estimates, reported on by Bloomberg, Apple has just under 8 percent of the Chinese smartphone market, compared with over 33 percent for Huawei and Xiaomi combined. Apple’s market share has reportedly grown since it launched the iPhone X. However, analysts aren’t convinced that the Cupertino, California-based company has a decent shot of continuing to expand in China because its phones cost much more than rivals. (See also: Is Apple's iPhone X Threatened by Chinese Rivals?) “Apple’s growth this quarter is only temporary,” said Mo Jia, an analyst with researcher Canalys, according to Bloomberg. “The hefty price of iPhone X is going to hurt sales in China.” (See also: Apple, Microsoft Will Drive 2018 Tech Earnings Growth: Moody's.)

400,Donna Fuscaldo,12212017,Investopedia,12142017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Altaba (AABA), the remnants of Yahoo after its sale of its core internet assets to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), could stand to benefit when the corporate tax rate is lowered if it opts to sell any of its stake in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba Group (BABA). With the tax bill about to land on President Donald Trump’s desk, the corporate tax rate is expected to be reduced to 21%, which could provide upside to Altaba stock to the tune of about $7 a share or around 10%, Susquehanna Financial wrote in a research report this week. Analyst Joseph Stauff predicted in the note, which was covered by Barron’s, that shares should dip more, providing an upside opportunity. “We think it is likely that Altaba will trade at a 21% discount to intrinsic (value) soon after corporate tax reform is passed by year-end,” Stauff wrote in the note. He noted that a lower corporate tax rate would reduce the amount of taxes the company owes if it sold its stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba on the open market. What’s more, bulls think the discount to net asset value should be narrower than the current 26%. It was around 30% about a month ago, noted Barron’s. (See also: Altaba Stock Breaks Out After Verizon Sale.) Altaba started trading under its new symbol in the summer and since then has had a bumpy ride as investors try to figure out what the new company is all about. One of the most attractive aspects of it is its 15% stake in Alibaba, which, according to media reports, is valued at around $341 billion. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, it warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. Altaba also owns a stake in Yahoo Japan valued at $7.7 billion, has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon. (See also: Altaba to Buy Back Up to $5 Billion in Shares.) While Altaba is likely to explore ways to monetize its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan via a tax-efficient strategy that may include selling the stock back to Yahoo Japan, there is more concern about what will happen with the Alibaba stake. According to Barron’s, Altaba bulls think Alibaba will purchase the stake from Altaba in a tax-free exchange. If it did happen, the Alibaba shares would likely be discounted enough that the Chinese e-commerce giant would be interested in the transaction. Barron’s pegs that at an around a 15% discount. If the corporate tax rate is lowered, Altaba will have more leverage in talks with Alibaba since unloading the shares on the open market would now be an option and would result in a lower tax bill than in the past. While Alibaba hasn’t been interested in buying back the shares if there is a chance that 384 million shares can land in the market the Chinese online retailer may make a move.

Both Verizon and AT&T trade at forward P/E ratios of around 13, below the overall value of 20 for the telecom sector, Barron's says, adding that Verizon should benefit from an easing of price wars in the wireless market. REITs have lagged the market in 2017, with YTD total returns of around 5% versus about 21% for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), per Barron's. The sector has a low multiple versus the S&P 500 and can generate mid- to high-single-digit returns in 2018, Barron's adds. SL Green, however, has a trailing twelve months P/E ratio of 97, per Barron's. On the other hand, this REIT trades at a discount to its private market value, Barron's says. Fitch Ratings recently upgraded SL Green, which invests primarily in Manhattan office buildings, to a positive outlook with a rating of BBB-, per Business Wire. China Mobile is the dominant wireless player in China, and has the strongest balance sheet among global telecom companies, with cash equal to about 30% of its market value, Barron's indicates.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) are the two dominant wireless companies in the U.S., easily passing Sprint and T-Mobile in both subscribers and network size. The position has made them something of a duopoly in the market, which leads to incredibly strong profitability. The question for investors is: Which stock is the better buy? Here's a look at how Verizon and AT&T stack up. Image source: Getty Images. You can see below that AT&T is the bigger company from a revenue perspective, but Verizon has generated more net income over the last few years. VZ Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The big reason for Verizon's better bottom line is its superior gross margin. The company clearly has some pricing power in the market, and is exploiting it today. But that better operating position may not last. Where Verizon and AT&T start to look different to investors is their strategic moves to build a telecommunications company of the future. Verizon bought Yahoo earlier this year for $4.5 billion, which will be added to AOL to create a company called Oath. It could be argued that Oath is just the remnants of an internet that's long lost its value for investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is attempting to acquire Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX.DL) to combine telecommunications and media assets. This would allow AT&T to bundle wireless with TV and internet for millions of customers. And given the FCC's recent decision to overturn net neutrality, AT&T might be able to give its own customers a superior experience with Time Warner content. Strategically, AT&T is making better moves, and is adding adjacent businesses that will give it pricing power in the future. But the right strategic moves now could have costs elsewhere down the line. When we look out 5-10 years to see which company will be able to build the better 5G network to drive the next phase of growth, the strategies I laid out above become important. You can see that both Verizon and AT&T have debt loads around $115 billion after going on buying sprees the last few years. If AT&T's proposed buyout of Time Warner goes through, about half of the $85.4 billion purchase price will be paid for from the balance sheet or new debt. The company said it has a $40 billion bridge term facility to finance the deal, but you can see that the balance sheet will be stretched further. VZ Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts This is important because both Verizon and AT&T are rolling out 5G networks that will drive a new generation of connected devices. It won't just be smartphones using 5G -- cars, VR headsets, and smart cities will use 5G, just to name a few applications. Given Verizon's higher net income and lower net debt (assuming the Time Warner deal is completed), it may have a better balance sheet for building a 5G network going forward. There's no clear-cut winner between Verizon and AT&T, but the stronger margins, net incomes, and better balance sheet are what make me give Verizon the nod today. I like AT&T's strategic direction, but it seems to be adding an awful lot of debt to grow its scale, and that's a risk I don't want to take in the telecommunications business. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been pointing to its expansion into the enterprise wireless market as a meaningful growth driver for the better part of a year. Indeed, T-Mobile is well behind its competitors when it comes to enterprise customers. At an investor conference last week, COO Mike Sievert mentioned the company only has a 2% to 3% market share. Enterprise represents yet another way for T-Mobile to steal customers away from AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). AT&T counts over 87 million wireless connections among its business customers -- 51 million postpaid and nearly 36 million connected devices. For reference, T-Mobile has fewer than 58 million total branded customers. But the real reason T-Mobile is excited about its progress with business customers is because management feels it's a strong leading indicator of consumer behavior. Image source: T-Mobile. Choosing a wireless carrier is a much bigger decision for a business with hundreds of employee phones to service than it is for a consumer household. Not only is the business looking to spend more money, there are significant switching costs to consider. Every employer needs to make the switch. Businesses aren't just going to change carriers to save a few bucks a month because of those significantly higher switching costs. Therefore, they're much more likely to really review what a carrier like T-Mobile has to offer before signing a contract. They want a carrier that can live up to their needs, and if it can save the business a few bucks a month, that's good too. That's why Sievert sees T-Mobile's growing share of the enterprise market as a good sign more consumer customers are still to come. One of the big reasons T-Mobile is starting to attract more enterprise customers is because it only recently completed the rollout of its nationwide network. The network now covers 321 million people, and it boasts average speeds faster than AT&T and Verizon. That kind of coverage is great for businesses because they don't need to worry about network availability in their offices all over the country. Additionally, employees that travel to worksites or customer offices shouldn't have any problems staying connected either. From a retail perspective, there's a bit more work for T-Mobile. To that end, T-Mobile expects to open nearly 1,500 new retail locations this year. It had already completed 1,000 new stores by midyear, but the pace has slowed considerably. With nationwide marketing campaigns, T-Mobile's new retail locations should scale relatively quickly, but there's still work to do with educating consumers in new markets about T-Mobile's presence and network availability. Businesses signing onto T-Mobile is a sign that the network strength and value is there, and it's just a matter of getting customers in the doors in new markets. Enterprise customers are big wins. Business contracts include thousands of new customers that are less likely to change carriers in the near future. What's more, it establishes a customer base in some of T-Mobile's relatively new markets, and those customers can spread the word about T-Mobile's service. As more customers come on board, it seems likely T-Mobile will be able to attract more retail customers as well. As such, it won't have to make as many promotional offers and it can increase its scale, allowing it to establish significantly greater cash flow. And with plans to grow cash flow nearly 50% per year over the next couple years and a new buyback program in place, the ability to more easily attract retail customers is paramount. ","

Sometimes it's possible to find value where it appears there isn't any. Maybe that old, scruffy jacket just needs a cleaning. Or an old car buried under a layer of rust is actually a classic waiting to be restored. In those cases, you need to have the vision to see something desirable when the outer appearance screams something else entirely. Those types of situations are common on the stock market, too: a beaten-down company can be a hidden gem about to turn a corner. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) isn't one of those stories. It's a company that's losing money as its customer base shrinks, and has cut its dividend and conducted a reverse split of its stock. There are signs that the company has started to trim its losses, but that will only slow down the inevitable. Cord cutting has accelerated, which has not been good for Frontier. Image source: Getty Images. When Frontier bought Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) in April 2016, the deal made sense. The company was spending $10.54 billion for approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million cable subscribers. That huge expenditure would, in theory, give the company the scale and synergy it needed to compete with larger players. What Frontier didn't count on was that the market was changing. Cord-cutting sped up, and companies offering internet delivered via telephone-based technology saw their subscriber bases drop at the same time. That was a double punch to Frontier, which caused it to lose subscribers and money in each quarter since the Verizon deal closed. *There was one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. Frontier CEO Daniel McCarthy has done a good job managing the company's finances and did trim Frontier's losses in Q3, both in terms of customers and on a dollar basis. ""Our third quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" said McCarthy in the Q3 earnings release. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas and Florida (CTF) markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" These numbers are better, but they're still moving in the wrong direction. It's also worth noting that cord-cutting slowed across the entire industry in Q3, with Frontier's losses being proportional to those of its rivals. Frontier has cut over $1 billion in operating expenses, with plans to save another $350 million more. That's good news, but it does not change the overall long-term prospects for the company. The best-case scenario for Frontier is that it manages to cost-cut its way to breakeven. That's unlikely, but even if it happens, just holding on is not the same as succeeding. Industry trends are working against Frontier. Verizon likely sold these properties because it saw that telco-based cable and internet companies would be hurt by cord cutting without being able to make up the losses on the broadband side. Frontier's stock price is low because the company has little value. It's a wounded animal slowly bleeding to death. It might hold on for a long time, and there's always the chance it gets acquired -- but the company has a failing business model that's unlikely to be fixed. ","

Many tech stocks don't pay dividends. But that doesn't mean the sector is void of top-notch dividend stocks. We asked three of our Foolish investors to pick a high-yield tech stock worthy of your investment dollars. Here's why they chose International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). Image source: Getty Images. Leo Sun (IBM): IBM has posted annual revenue declines for 22 straight quarters, as its higher-growth ""strategic imperatives"" (cloud, mobile, social, security, and analytics) failed to offset the ongoing declines at its older business hardware, software, and IT segments. IBM's turnaround has been so sluggish that even Warren Buffett, renowned for his patience, sold off billions of dollars in shares over the past year. However, IBM is also approaching an inflection point. Big Blue's 0.4% sales decline last quarter was much shallower than its dips in previous quarters, and there's hope that it can finally report positive growth in the near future. Last quarter, IBM's strategic imperative revenue over the past 12 months rose 10% annually, accounting for 45% of its total revenue. That's up from 40% in the prior-year quarter. IBM is also investing in next-gen technologies -- like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing -- which should keep its technology relevant for decades to come. Analysts expect IBM's revenue to fall 2% this year, and for its earnings to rise about 2%. That stable earnings growth -- aided by cost-cutting measures and its ongoing shift toward higher-margin cloud services -- is good news for its forward dividend yield of 3.9%. That dividend, which has been raised annually for 22 straight years, is supported by a low payout ratio of 49%. IBM's stock is also inexpensive at 11 times next year's earnings. IBM remains a cheap income play as the company approaches a potential turnaround. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): After two years of slumping revenue, driven in part by the shift to subscriptions and recurring revenue, networking hardware giant Cisco expects to return to revenue growth next quarter. The stock currently sits right around its 10-year high thanks to this news, but dividend investors shouldn't be scared away. Cisco stock currently yields about 3%. The company has only been paying a dividend since 2011, but it's quickly become one of the best tech dividend stocks. The latest dividend increase came in February, when Cisco boosted the quarterly payout by about 10%. Only 45% of Cisco's free cash flow went toward the dividend in fiscal 2017, leaving some room for further dividend growth even if earnings growth is sluggish. Dividend growth could ramp up even faster if a tax reform bill is passed this year. Cisco has tens of billions of dollars in cash sitting overseas, and it plans to accelerate its share buyback program if it can tap that cash at a reduced rate. That will reduce the share count, allowing for a larger per-share dividend increase. Cisco's revenue and earnings growth probably won't light the world on fire. But a 3% yield and room for dividend growth should have dividend investors interested in this stock. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): Verizon stock has returned a modest 4.6% so far in 2017, lagging the S&P 500's 21% gain. But that's largely because shares of the telecommunications giant are still recovering from its first-ever reported decline in postpaid wireless customers amid intensifying competition earlier this year. Largely thanks to its popular new Verizon Unlimited plan, however, the wireless side of the business has been moving in the right direction since then, including the addition of 603,000 retail postpaid connections last quarter alone. And those customers are exceedingly loyal, with retail postpaid churn during the quarter of just 0.75%. In the end, with shares only recently having broken into positive territory for the year, I think now is great time for opportunistic investors to buy Verizon stock and reinvest its healthy 4.4% dividend.

Matt Frankel (Iron Mountain): Iron Mountain is a real estate investment trust whose primary business is secure document storage. This 6.1% yielder makes about three-fourths of its money from its records and information management business, which it conducts in more than 1,400 facilities around the world. Image source: Getty Images. In addition, Iron Mountain has quietly been getting into the data center business, which could be an excellent long-term growth opportunity. The need for data storage has been growing rapidly and showing no signs of slowing down, and Iron Mountain has the ability to leverage its trusted brand name. Data centers make up a small portion of the company's revenue today, but Iron Mountain plans to grow this area of its business over the coming years. Just recently, Iron Mountain said it would buy IO Data Centers for $1.315 billion, which the company intends to finance with a combination of debt and equity. The market didn't seem to like the news very much, and the stock dropped, which could create an excellent opportunity for long-term investors to get in. Sean O'Reilly (Verizon Communications): ExxonMobil is the quintessential dividend stock. With a long and storied history that stretches back across nearly a century. To trump ExxonMobil's merits as a dividend stock, not only will its 3.7% dividend yield need to be surpassed, but it needs to offer both growth and stability. My nomination for such a dividend stock is none other than Verizon Communications. Verizon is the largest wireless carrier in the U.S. Its wireless division alone generated over $21 billion in the third quarter. True, the division is suffering amid fierce competition from competitors like T-Mobile. And this is what leads us to Verizon's plans for the future. The company still generates lots of cash -- over $17 billion so far this year. It is using this money to invest in becoming a 21st-century media and distribution powerhouse. For example, Verizon just closed a deal to pay the NFL $1.5 billion over the next five years to stream live football games to its subscribers. Naturally, Verizon will be inserting ads during the games. The move is being made to bolster its content-credentials and build up its AOL and Yahoo! sports hub properties. Its cost-cutting initiatives solidify Yahoo!'s chops as a dividend stock. Over the next four years, management has a stated goal of cutting costs by a total of $10 billion. With a juicy 5% dividend, status as the No. 1 mobile carrier in the U.S., and increasingly savvy investments in content, Verizon is a dividend stock that safely pays investors a higher yield than ExxonMobil. Reuben Gregg Brewer (Royal Dutch Shell, plc): Shares of Shell are up 12% this year, while Exxon's are down 8%. And still Shell provides a better yield, currently around 5.75%. That's lower than it was before, but there's good reasons for that...and for income-minded investors to still be interested, here. There have been two notable negatives at Shell in recent years: high levels of debt and poorly executed energy projects. On the debt front, the integrated oil major increased its long-term debt load by 50% in 2016 to fund a major acquisition. It was an aggressive move consummated when oil prices were still relatively weak. However, since that point, Shell has inked deals to sell off nearly $30 billion of non-core assets. Long-term debt, meanwhile, is down around 8% since peaking in late 2016. I don't believe there's a material reason to worry about debt at this point, particularly since oil prices are now more supportive, and Shell recently ended its cash-saving scrip dividend program. As far as execution goes, Shell is turning a corner here, too. Return on invested capital has risen since a nadir in late 2016. Notably, it has begun to close the gap that existed between its performance and Exxon, a perennial leader on this metric. Shell believes that, as it reshapes its business, it can get that metric up to around 10% -- more than twice its current level. So there's reason to be optimistic here, too. I wouldn't call Shell cheap today, but if you are an income investor, it's still a fair price for good company with a hefty dividend yield. ","

Income investors naturally gravitate toward dividend stocks with high yields. However, just because a stock offers a big payout doesn't automatically make it a smart buy. In fact, more often than not, a high yield can actually serve as a warning sign. So are there any high yield stocks that are worth buying today? To answer that question, let's put the 10 highest-yielding stocks today in the S&P 500 to the test. Company Ticker Dividend Yield Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) 26.2% CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) 15.3% Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 6.4% Macy's (NYSE:M) 5.9% SCANA Corp. (NYSE:SCG) 5.5% AT&T (NYSE: T) 5.4% Navient Corp. (NASDAQ:NAVI) 5% Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP) 4.9% Ford (NYSE:F) 4.8% Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) 4.7% Data source: Finviz, as of December 8, 2017. This list excludes REITs and MLPs. The first metric that I look at when I'm judging a dividend stock is the company's payout ratio. This is calculated by dividing the company's last four quarters of net income by its dividend payment. While this metric has its flaws, it does give investors a quick way to gauge whether or not a company can afford its dividend. Image source: Getty Images. As a general rule, I get nervous when I see this ratio exceed 80%. Anything over 100% is even more dubious, because it means the company is paying out more in dividends than it is earning. That's not sustainable for long. Here's how these 10 companies stack up on payout ratio: Company Payout Ratio Frontier Communications N/A CenturyLink 372% Seagate Technology 95% Macy's 67% SCANA Corp. 77% AT&T 94% Navigant Corp. 35% Helmerich & Payne N/A Ford 55% Verizon Communications 59% Table source: Yahoo! Finance. N/M = not available; these companies reported losses over the past 12 months. Right off the bat, we can eliminate several companies from contention as potential portfolio additions. Frontier Communication and Helmerich & Payne are currently losing money, which I find troubling. CenturyLink's payout ratio of 372% is also highly suspect. I think the smart move is to pass on these stocks. AT&T and Seagate Technology sport payout ratios above 90%. That tells me that they are likely safe for now, but if the companies hit a rough patch, those dividends could be on the chopping block. However, given that they exceed my 80% threshold, I would exclude them from further consideration. How can we quickly get a sense of a company's growth potential? One method is to look at its historic rate of growth, and its projected growth rate over the next five years. Here's a look at how the five remaining companies compare: Company Past 5 Years' Earnings Growth (Annualized) Next 5 Years' Earnings Growth, Estimated (Annualized) Macy's (14.7%) 18.6% SCANA Corp. 4.3% 5.5% Navient Corp. (3.5%) (3.8%) Ford 4.8% (8.3%) Verizon Communications 10.7% 1.3% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Once again, a simple test helps us to refine our list even further. Navient's net income has been under pressure over the last few years, which isn't a good sign. What's more, profits are expected to continue declining over the next five years, which could be related to an ongoing lawsuit that accuses it of predatory lending practices. That provides me with enough reason to steer clear. Turning to Ford, the company's earnings growth over the last few years has been decent, but nothing spectacular. However, analysts are expecting profits to head downhill over the next few years, based on the widespread opinion that we have passed peak auto sales. Factor in the period of disruption the auto industry is heading into right now, and I think the stock is also worth avoiding. Image source: Ford. Verizon Communications is a tougher call. Its payout ratio is low, and it has grown profits at a healthy pace recently. However, market watchers expect Verizon's net income growth to be anemic over the next few years, which makes sense given that T-Mobile continues to woo away its customers. While I don't think this is a bad investment, I'd rather skip Verizon in favor of something that promises faster growth. That brings us to SCANA. This utility offers a strong yield, modest payout ratio, and mid-single-digit growth potential. The fly in the ointment here is that is the company is involved in a messy situation because it recently decided to abandon construction of two extremely costly nuclear reactors. The fallout from that decision forced the company to promise rate reductions to customers, and led to the departure of its CEO and COO. Given the complexities, I think it makes sense to take a pass on SCANA. That leaves us with Macy's, which might give some investors pause since its profits have dropped considerably over the last few years. The wave of store closures and falling comps it has endured isn't surprising given the current state of retail. However, there are a few positive signs right now that the department store chain could be turning the ship around. First, the company is investing heavily in its e-commerce channel. Second, Macy's is rolling out a new loyalty program that could increase customer visits. Third, it owns a lot of valuable property that the market isn't fully valuing. Finally, the carnage in the retail sector could allow the company to capture market share in the long run once the current wave of bankruptcies subsides. Add it all up, and Wall Street believes that Macy's profits will grow in excess of 18% annually over the next few years. Throw in a sustainable dividend yield of 5.9% and you can see why Macy's is the only stock on this list that I think is worth considering. ","

Sprint (NYSE:S) missed out on its opportunity to merge with T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and now it's left fighting for itself. That means investing in its network infrastructure. But as CFO Tarek Robbiati noted at a recent investor conference, ""When you invest more money you are having to recoup that investment."" That means price increases. Sprint has already taken a small step toward increasing its pricing. It went from offering five lines of unlimited data for $90 per month to five lines for $100 per month. But Robbiati noted there will be more price increases in due course. That's great news for the rest of the industry. Sprint has continually put pressure on other carrier's service prices. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have seen their service revenues decline over the last couple of years. But the ease in competitiveness could allow those numbers to rise once again. Image source: Sprint. Sprint consistently ranks at the bottom of the competition in terms of network quality. It has the spectrum licenses to build out a better network, but it has limited capital to deploy it. Management has taken to fiscal gymnastics to increase its cash balance, such as selling some of its assets to a sister company and leasing them back. Raising prices is its only option if it wants to remain even modestly competitive. Price is, by far, Sprint's biggest differentiating factor, which is why Robbiati says, ""We will always want to be the price leader."" If it wasn't, it would lose a ton of customers to any of its competitors offering a better deal on a better network. Fewer customers spending more per month may cause some short-term pain. But it's the only option Sprint has to ensure long-term survival without a merger or acquisition. The biggest winners when Sprint decides to raise its prices are its competitors. Sprint has been one of the biggest catalysts for the intense competitive pressure in the industry. Offering competitive price promotions, including low-priced unlimited mobile data service and lower device prices, forced the hands of AT&T and Verizon to offer similar services and promotions, or risk losing more subscribers. Sprint's decision to increase prices means it will be able to increase its average revenue per user. But the decision also means competitors will be able to attract customers with fewer price promotions, and could potentially increase prices themselves. Just as important, Sprint's competitors could see lower subscriber churn, or higher gross additions, as fewer customers flock to Sprint, naturally leading to higher service revenue. Price increases likely mean Sprint will acquire fewer customers going forward. That means more left over for T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T. T-Mobile has already noted it's seen a better ratio of customers switching from Sprint (and everyone else) this quarter than last. Verizon's streak of positive postpaid phone subscriber net additions ought to continue after several disappointing quarters. And AT&T might start to turn things around, as well. Sprint already has fallen to the fourth-place carrier in the United States, and its network isn't improving, either. Management needs to find a better way to differentiate itself other than price because consumers are clearly opting to pay a little bit more for better coverage. Sprint has boatloads of wireless spectrum currently sitting on the sidelines because it doesn't have the capital to deploy it. Most of its unused spectrum is high-band, which requires a more dense network, making it more capital intensive to deploy. The upside is a much stronger and faster network once it's deployed. T-Mobile just went through the process of deploying relatively high-band spectrum, and now has one of the best networks in the country. If Sprint can survive a few years of capital-intensive spending while customers continue to leave, it could put itself in a much stronger position next decade. There's a lot of risk, however, that it might not be able to complete its network upgrades without the benefit of a merger or acquisition. ","

A full transcript follows the video. Chris Hill: Verizon is renewing its contract with the NFL to live-stream games to its subscribers. Verizon had paid $1 billion over the past four years, and now over the next five years, Jason, they're paying $2 billion. On a percentage basis, that's quite a leap. Jason Moser: That is a leap. When you look, it's a big deal. I think that number begs the question, are they paying too much? And I tend to think that yes, they are, for a few different reasons. No. 1, this isn't an exclusive deal. I think it's going to span carriers. And I do understand that, because this is less about Verizon, per say, and more about the properties that they own in Yahoo and AOL and what not. So, I understand, at least, having that sort of span carriers. But I think you have to look a little further out and think about the NFL and the pressures that we're seeing the league facing right now. It's not to say that the NFL is going away. But in line with the Disney discussion we were having regarding the sporting properties they're getting there, I think the NFL is hitting a point where I don't know that they can continue to command the same type of pricing power in the years to come. When we look at the nature of the sport, the injuries that are taking place, there are a lot of people that have a lot of problems with what's going on right now. And we have to think about the future of the game and how many people are really saying, ""I don't want my kids to be a part of something like that."" That doesn't matter now, but it's going to matter 20 years from now, unless they get their act together. Verizon, they're really good at delivering that information and data to us, providing the content a little bit of a different story. I'm not sure this is really a deal that's going to make a whole heck of a lot of sense for them four or five years down the road. Again, I think we're probably hitting the point where the NFL is particular has hit that point where they can't command much more in the way of pricing. ","

The wearable device industry is still in its infancy as companies learn what kind of products resonate with consumers. Former hits like Fitbit's tracker or the Nike Fuelband are giving way to smartwatches that offer more information than just steps or calories for the day. Product extensions and niche applications are also starting to pop up, allowing companies to fill them with innovative solutions. As investors look at wearables in 2018, there are three stocks that offer compelling value for investors. Image source: Apple. No company makes wearables on the scale of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In two and a half years on the market, Apple Watch has become the flagship smartwatch in technology. Apple doesn't release unit volumes for the Apple Watch, but estimates are that around 15 million watches have been sold in the last year, and the company is already among the biggest watchmakers in the world by revenue. What makes Apple so intriguing in wearables is that the watch is just the beginning. AirPods can be tied directly into a cellular-connected Series 3 Apple Watch, allowing the user to remain in touch with the world without carrying a smartphone. A product like AirPods may not seem like a wearable, but as a user I find myself wearing them most of the workday, just to have quick access to phone calls, podcasts, or music I'm listening to. In that sense, the combination of Apple Watch and AirPods has become indispensable. We don't know what wearable devices Apple is working on, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the platform expand. Glasses with augmented reality or a full virtual reality headset could be on the horizon, given the technology Apple has already released. What's clear is that Apple's effort to dominate wearables is far from over. Apple is the wearable company with a wide reach, but Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) is a wearable company with more niche applications. Its watches are standard for athletes who run, bike, swim, and do triathlons. Marine, outdoor recreation, and even cameras are also markets that Garmin targets in wearable devices. What's nice about Garmin's wearable business is there are distinct use cases for its products. As an example, doing a triathlon with an Apple Watch is possible, but a Garmin Fenix watch is specifically built for triathlons and is durable and has enough battery life to last for a long race. Owning those niches will give Garmin a valuable position in the wearable market. My surprise wearable pick isn't a wearable company at all (at least not directly). Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is the wireless company that will connect millions of wearables to the world over the next decade. Today, watches from Apple and Samsung are leading the charge to connect watches to wireless networks, but that could be just the beginning. In the future, augmented or virtual reality glasses could stream data directly from 5G wireless networks. We could be wearing medical devices that provide real-time medical data to service providers. Image source: Verizon. It's not really clear what next-generation wearable devices will be released over the next few years, but I think it's becoming obvious that fast wireless networks will be an enabler of new technology. Verizon is a leader in the industry and its investment in 5G networks will help drive wearables to a new level. That's why this is a great investment in the future of wearables. Wearable technology isn't yet as commonplace as a laptop or smartphone, but the segment is growing quickly as products improve. That presents an incredible opportunity to companies that can build wearable products people want to use. Apple and Garmin have strategies that can win in the market, and Verizon is the platform millions will use to connect those devices. That's why they're the wearable stocks I would buy today.

    3 Wearables Stocks to Buy for 2018 -- The Motley Fool

413,Matthew Cochrane,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) designs analog semiconductors that power wireless connectivity in a number of different devices like smartphones, wearables, and smart-home systems. Given the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphone connectivity, this has been a good business to be in the past few years. Shareholders certainly have nothing to complain about this year. Shares are up 28% year to date, easily outpacing the S&P 500's returns by double digits. That being said, shares have dropped by almost 18% since the company reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2017 results in early November. When a company's stock drops precipitously shortly after earnings are reported, it's healthy for investors to ask what caused the tumble. Sometimes it might represent legitimately bad news indicating that an investor's original thesis for investing in a stock is busted. If this is the case, it might be best for even long-term, buy-and-hold investors to sell. However, it can also be a case of a short-term obsessed market losing sight of the big picture. In the case of Skyworks Solutions, I firmly believe it is the case of the latter and that the recent drop represents a buying opportunity. Skyworks Solutions offers growth at a reasonable price, virtues difficult to find in this bull market. Image source: Skyworks Solutions Inc. A close look at Skyworks' quarter doesn't find too much wrong. The company delivered record revenues of $984.6 million, an 18% increase year over year. Net income came in at $281.3 million, a 14% increase year over year. If the numbers were so bad, maybe the company's guidance was bad? Hardly. The company is calling for revenue to be up 15% to $1.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to rise 19% to $1.91 next quarter. Data source: Skyworks Solutions Inc The company's valuation also appears reasonable. Using Skyworks' full fiscal year non-GAAP EPS of $6.45, the stock is selling at a relatively cheap price-to-earnings ratio of 14.9; even using the company's GAAP EPS of $5.41, the P/E ratio is only 17.8. The company's balance sheet is nearly pristine: It ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no long-term debt. While Skyworks' balance sheet is clean, the valuation is reasonable, and the company is growing revenue and earnings at solid rates, what really makes the story compelling is Skyworks' positioning in two major macro trends. Skyworks Solutions is poised to capitalize on the growth of the Internet of Things and the massive 5G wireless network upgrade in the coming years. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Lest there be any doubt, 5G wireless networks are coming. In late November, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) announced it would be rolling out the next generation in wireless networks in three to five domestic markets next year, beginning with Sacramento, California. The benefits of 5G networks will be incredible. During the company's fourth-quarter conference call, CEO Liam Griffin said 5G networks would provide a ""significant boost in speed"" and that 5G could be up to 100 times faster than 4G networks. Why does this matter to Skyworks investors? Because the chips Skyworks makes for 5G connectivity cost more and are more profitable than the chips for lesser network speeds. In the conference call, transcribed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Griffin said: ""In order to make the leap to 5G, system architectures will require significantly more powerful connectivity engines to ensure the intense performance challenges are realized. This upgrade wave will create an enormous growth catalyst for the entire smartphone ecosystem. ""And as a leader in unwiring the planet, Skyworks is well positioned to capitalize. With extensive technology breadth and depth, strategic partnerships with all leading smartphone and IoT customers, differentiated system solutions enabling unmatched levels of integration and performance, all underpinned by our aggressive investments over the past 2 decades to expand our product portfolio, IP and scale. As a result, we have the profitability, cash flow and balance sheet to extend our leadership position. Our strategic R&D and CapEx investments will be pivotal as the scale and technology requirements around 5G intensify."" There are more connected devices than ever before. Everything from cars and watches to refrigerators and thermostats can be connected these days. Studies back up this observation. Research firm IDC believes total worldwide spending on IoT will increase from $800 billion this year to almost $1.4 trillion in 2021. Business Insider believes there will be 24 billion connected devices by 2020. On the conference call, Griffin said this number could be as high as 75 billion devices by 2025. He also said mobile data usage is expected to increase five times by 2021. Few companies are better situated to capitalize on this undeniable trend than Skyworks. As Griffin pointed out, "" ... by definition, these applications would not be possible without fast, secure, power-efficient connectivity solutions provided by Skyworks."" Later he added that there's going to be a ""massive upgrade cycle in the IoT space as well"" with the onset of 5G. In the short term, the company continues to trade on Apple rumors and speculation, because the smartphone maker is such a huge customer of Skyworks' products. For instance, when news leaks that an Apple supplier factory manager's nephew's former college roommate said they heard that the iPhone X wasn't going to be as big of a supercycle as previously thought, Skyworks shares will often dip that day. But, in the long term, investors need to realize that Skyworks Solutions is going for a reasonable valuation while poised to capitalize on some of the greatest industrial trends in the world today. In today's market, that is about as a good of an investment as you're going to find. ","

Those widely considered to be the founding fathers of the modern web say the Federal Communications Commission doesn’t understand the internet. And dissenting democrats like FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn called the ruling a “fiercely spun, legally lightweight, consumer-harming, corporate-enabling Destroying Internet Freedom Order.” But it wasn’t all gnashing of teeth. Anti-regulation Republicans claimed a victory for freedom. And a number of companies, optimistic over that newfound freedom to focus on profits, saw their share prices rise steadily on an otherwise down day for the S&P 500

Instead, I’d like to explore which stocks stand to win or lose from the potentially game-changing ruling that will affect communications and tech companies in the months to come. Here are three big winners and three big losers under the recent net neutrality repeal.

                                   is the largest wireless carrier in the U.S., so it has the most to gain from the idea of “freedom” to runs its networks as it pleases. The company’s so-called “unlimited” plans were already throttling playback quality for many customers, and now it quite literally has nothing to stop it from similar tactics in the future. Read: Why the end of net neutrality isn’t the end of the internet Furthermore, there will be less pressure to keep spending some $15 billion annually on capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain its network. The ability to prioritize data usage and use its existing network better means more cash for things like dividends or buying back shares instead. As the largest wireless-mobile network, any throttling efforts that reduce data usage by even a small amount per customer will add up in a very big way. And if people want faster speeds, of course, Verizon will certainly allow them to pay for that privilege. The icing on the cake is content tie-ins with its Oath brand that contains AOL, the Huffington Post and Yahoo! If ISPs can give certain domains preference over others, it’s pretty obvious which sites Verizon is going to bias toward. Winner — Amazon.com Amazon

                                   CEO Jeff Bezos and other execs have publicly expressed displeasure with the FCC ruling. But, on balance, the end of net neutrality is almost clearly a net positive for the company. For starters, competition for services will more than likely be on the decline, thanks to the notion of “paid prioritization.” Without net neutrality protections, data-rich service providers end up paying higher rates to telecoms to guarantee their content gets there in the way they want. Some companies will pass on this added cost to end users, and others won’t even bother to compete in these “fast lanes” as a result. But Amazon has a long history of putting scale before profits with rock-bottom pricing, so you can expect it to be the discount leader in how it operates as a consumer-facing internet company with its e-commerce operations, its Prime video and just about everything else it offers. Furthermore, the end of net neutrality likely means web hosts may see fees rise, particularly for data-heavy destinations they maintain. Again, Bezos will happily let his Amazon Web Services arm shoulder that cost as it continues to help businesses with storage and content delivery. That’s something Amazon shareholders can deal with in the short term as it waits out the competitors. Silicon Valley, in general, may see a lot of increased costs, but Amazon’s stock thrives in a low-margin world. While startups face higher barriers to entry and more uncertainty, Amazon.com stock has a clear vision and Wall Street’s trust that it will come out ahead. Winner — Citrix Systems Citrix

                                   is an enterprise-tech company with its fingers in many of the pies that are so appetizing to investors these days, including cloud computing and cybersecurity. But of particular note is that roughly a third of the company’s revenue comes from its network-delivery division that includes its NetScaler product. This technology balances the load of data on a company’s site and makes it easier for companies to use their existing servers and work more efficiently, rather than simply paying for more capacity. Read: Why you should care that the FCC has put an end to net neutrality While this is currently a corporate IT offering, the general concept is perfect for an age when data is at a premium for all parties. You can be sure that every e-commerce site or media company is going to think very seriously about their outward-facing metrics as much as internal efficiencies. Page-load times and the “weight” of a site could make it much more difficult to reach customers or operate a business profitably. Who better to help companies navigate this dynamic than an established tech-services company that already offers a robust menu of valuable enterprise tech products? Loser — Netflix Netflix

Sure, the risk of constant buffering and perpetually unreliable streams are an existential crisis for Netflix’s stock. But the vote couldn’t have come at a worse time than now. The stock is down about 8% from its October highs and struggling mightily to build on past gains. And while investors have had concerns lately about its international growth, it’s important to remember that nearly every penny of profit comes from its domestic business that has seen flat-lining user growth. Thinner margins there would be a most unwelcome development.

                                   has consumers abuzz with anticipation over its own over-the-top streaming service that will be a direct competitor in many ways. As a diversified media company with deep pockets, Netflix can’t afford to let consumers or investors down in 2018. Sure, Netflix is always the fashionable pick for a victim of net neutrality. But if you recall all those articles about how the service represented over a third of internet traffic back in 2015, it’s easy to understand why. Loser — Frontier Communications If you want a more obvious victim of the FCC ruing than Netflix, it may be Frontier Communications

                                   This is a company that dropped by roughly 10% on the day of the ruling, proof positive that Wall Street is turning negative. And that’s saying something, considering that Frontier is down roughly 85% in the last 12 months already. Of course, there are good reasons for the downside move. Because while the GOP stance continues to be that fewer rules mean more “freedom,” the bottom line is that smaller internet service providers like Frontier simply won’t be able to operate competitively against the ISPs with deep pockets. After all, Verizon and Comcast

                                   can offer slow internet connectivity much cheaper, and premium internet much faster and reliably. Where does that leave the little guy like Frontier?

As investment advisors rebalance clients’ portfolios in the final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor with analysts - can be self-destructive. With the S&P 500’s rally pushing price/earnings multiples to highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own technology and other high-growth stocks may attract bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017. “A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have a good year,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year average of 27. “Grocery is local; it’s not an internet play.

Among those recommended in their recent cover story are these twelve, with their dividend yields and year-to-date total returns (price appreciation plus dividends): Total return data is through December 14. Barron's story was published on December 16. Barron's top choice for income-oriented investors in 2018 is master limited partnerships (MLPs) related to energy distribution in the U.S., with Enterprise Products Partners as among Barron's top 10 stock picks overall for 2018. Cash flow for the industry is projected to grow in the mid single digits in 2018, and MLP shares look to be trading below historical levels, per Barron's. As oil output rises in the U.S., pipeline MLPs will benefit. (For more, see also: 10 Stocks With 'Significant Upside' in an Overpriced Market.) European companies prefer paying dividends to share repurchases, making this Barron's second most-favored group. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, trades at a forward P/E of only eight, per Barron's, and shareholders may benefit from a planned spinoff of its truck-making unit. Both Verizon and AT&T trade at forward P/E ratios of around 13, below the overall value of 20 for the telecom sector, Barron's says, adding that Verizon should benefit from an easing of price wars in the wireless market. REITs have lagged the market in 2017, with YTD total returns of around 5% versus about 21% for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), per Barron's. The sector has a low multiple versus the S&P 500 and can generate mid- to high-single-digit returns in 2018, Barron's adds. SL Green, however, has a trailing twelve months P/E ratio of 97, per Barron's. On the other hand, this REIT trades at a discount to its private market value, Barron's says. Fitch Ratings recently upgraded SL Green, which invests primarily in Manhattan office buildings, to a positive outlook with a rating of BBB-, per Business Wire. China Mobile is the dominant wireless player in China, and has the strongest balance sheet among global telecom companies, with cash equal to about 30% of its market value, Barron's indicates. (For related reading, see: 8 Stocks That Can Outperform Amid Low Volatility: Goldman.) Merck has been out of favor with investors this year, but Barron's notes that they are a leading player ""in the hot immuno-oncology area."" Big consumer stocks such as PepsiCo offer the potential to deliver annual earnings growth in the mid- to high-single-digit range, Barron's believes. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telecom derives about 40% of its market value from its 64% ownership position in T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (TMUS), which has improving free cash flow, per Barron's. California-based electric utility Edison International has been beaten down recently over concerns about its potential financial liability over recent wildfires in that state.

Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) had a lousy year that was rooted in a decision it made in 2016. In April of last year, the company purchased Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida for $10.54 billion. That gave it approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers. It was a move that CEO Daniel McCarthy celebrated at the time. ""This is a transformative acquisition for Frontier that delivers first-rate assets and important new opportunities given our dramatically expanded scale,"" he said when the deal closed. ""It significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" What McCarthy didn't see is that the industry was changing. Cord cutting was going to shrink the cable business, and consumers were leaving telephone-company-based wireline broadband (what Frontier bought from Verizon) for cable-based service. Frontier has been losing cable customers as well. Image source: Getty Images. On the positive side, Frontier did gain some synergies from the deal. It was able to create over $1 billion in annual savings with a path toward creating around $400 million more. That's the only good news the company has experienced since the deal closed. Frontier has lost subscribers and money in every quarter since the Verizon deal closed. Both did lessen in the most-recent quarter, but the trends are still bleak. *There was one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. To conserve cash, Frontier cut its dividend as of the first quarter of its fiscal 2017. It slashed the quarterly payout from $0.105 per share, where it had been for over two years, to $0.04 per share. The company also, at roughly the same time, conducted a 15-1 reverse split of its stock. That move was made to keep shares above the $1 threshold required to maintain its listing. McCarthy continues to maintain an optimistic outlook. ""Our third-quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" said McCarthy in the Q3 earnings release. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" That's a rosy way to look at things, but even if the chain can stabilize its losses, there's very little reason to believe it can post gains. A best-case scenario for Frontier is that it finds a way to tread water by breaking even while maintaining its customer count. There's very little upside for shareholders aside from the possibility of a sale. Even that is unlikely -- at least at much of a premium -- because the technological reasons that have hurt Frontier would be a problem for any possible purchaser. ","

Sometimes it's possible to find value where it appears there isn't any. Maybe that old, scruffy jacket just needs a cleaning. Or an old car buried under a layer of rust is actually a classic waiting to be restored. In those cases, you need to have the vision to see something desirable when the outer appearance screams something else entirely. Those types of situations are common on the stock market, too: a beaten-down company can be a hidden gem about to turn a corner. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) isn't one of those stories. It's a company that's losing money as its customer base shrinks, and has cut its dividend and conducted a reverse split of its stock. There are signs that the company has started to trim its losses, but that will only slow down the inevitable. Cord cutting has accelerated, which has not been good for Frontier. Image source: Getty Images. When Frontier bought Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) in April 2016, the deal made sense. The company was spending $10.54 billion for approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million cable subscribers. That huge expenditure would, in theory, give the company the scale and synergy it needed to compete with larger players. What Frontier didn't count on was that the market was changing. Cord-cutting sped up, and companies offering internet delivered via telephone-based technology saw their subscriber bases drop at the same time. That was a double punch to Frontier, which caused it to lose subscribers and money in each quarter since the Verizon deal closed. *There was one-time impairment charge in Q2 2017. Frontier CEO Daniel McCarthy has done a good job managing the company's finances and did trim Frontier's losses in Q3, both in terms of customers and on a dollar basis. ""Our third quarter results highlight the ongoing stabilization across our business as we focus on executing our strategy,"" said McCarthy in the Q3 earnings release. ""During the quarter, we were pleased with the continued improvement in subscriber trends and churn in our California, Texas and Florida (CTF) markets, ongoing stabilization in our commercial business, and continued operating efficiencies."" These numbers are better, but they're still moving in the wrong direction. It's also worth noting that cord-cutting slowed across the entire industry in Q3, with Frontier's losses being proportional to those of its rivals. Frontier has cut over $1 billion in operating expenses, with plans to save another $350 million more. That's good news, but it does not change the overall long-term prospects for the company. The best-case scenario for Frontier is that it manages to cost-cut its way to breakeven. That's unlikely, but even if it happens, just holding on is not the same as succeeding. Industry trends are working against Frontier. Verizon likely sold these properties because it saw that telco-based cable and internet companies would be hurt by cord cutting without being able to make up the losses on the broadband side. Frontier's stock price is low because the company has little value. It's a wounded animal slowly bleeding to death. It might hold on for a long time, and there's always the chance it gets acquired -- but the company has a failing business model that's unlikely to be fixed. ","

Now that the GOP tax bill is a fait accompli, investors should take stock of the bill's effects on their holdings. To date, many analysts have focused on the bill's repatriation provision, declaring Apple the biggest beneficiary. However, repatriation is a narrow issue that will soon be discounted into stock prices. In the long run, it appears industries currently paying high effective tax rates with significant capital expenditures will benefit most from this bill. The industry that best fits this description is telecommunications: Income-hungry shareholders of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) should be thrilled. Image source: Getty Images. As the chart below shows, Verizon and AT&T pay nearly double the effective tax rate. T Effective Tax Rate (TTM) data by YCharts Unsurprisingly, telecoms will benefit significantly from the lower rate. Earlier this month a report from UBS found telecoms would most likely get a boost of 12% in earnings per share, if the bill lowered the tax rate to 25%; in the end, it was lowered to 21%. According to UBS, telecoms will get the highest boost from the plan, with transportation and retail faring almost as well. In the short run, AT&T and Verizon will also benefit from the bill's capital expenditures provision. For the next five years, companies can immediately expense capex for equipment and other short-lived items. This is a great benefit for AT&T and Verizon, which have spent $22.9 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively, on capital expenditures over the last 12 months: VZ Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts. While certain expenditures will continue to be capitalized (initially recorded on the balance sheet and expensed over time via depreciation), this should also provide tailwinds to investors by lowering the weighted average cost of capital for projects, making them more profitable. This provision couldn't come at a better time for telecommunication firms. Many are grappling on spending large sums of capex on 5G rollout, while questioning the return on their 4G rollout spend. A potential red flag is the new provision that limits interest deductibility, as both Verizon and AT&T have large piles of debt and required interest payments. The new bill limits the deductibility of net interest expense to 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the first four years, and at 30% of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) afterward. The chart below shows net interest income, EBITDA, and EBIT for both companies over the prior year: VZ EBITDA (TTM) data by YCharts. Even with the more-stringent EBIT figure, both look sound in the mid- to high teens. But this provision could limit the ability to borrow in the future, especially if further margin compression happens and interest rates increase. AT&T and Verizon have mostly missed out on the stock run since the election of Trump, but seem to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the policies enacted during his administration. This bill, and the overturn of net neutrality, should allow both firms to continue paying those massive dividends while growing revenue and earnings. ","

Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW) enjoyed quite a year in 2017 and, no, that's not a reference to the stock's 32% gain, a rise that easily outpaced the S&P 500's returns. While it's always nice to see the stocks we hold go up in price, long-term minded investors know that a focus on a company's prospects and fundamentals is far more important to sustained investment success than short term price movements. When investors check under the hood of Corning, there is a lot to like. This year Corning received a $200 million investment from the world's biggest company, signed a $1 billion-plus deal with one of the country's largest wireless networks, and announced the development of a new product that might end up being a $4 billion opportunity in a new market. Each of these announcements underlines a different and promising line of business for the company, illustrating how much Corning has transformed itself since being almost solely a display glass manufacturer, with earnings that were notoriously cyclical and often based on glass prices, a factor outside its control. Let's take a closer look at these growing lines of business to better appreciate the great year Corning just had. Data source: Corning Inc. Third-Quarter 2017 earnings press release Corning's Optical Communications division supplies optical fiber to major telecom companies and internet service providers. In April, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) made a commitment to purchase at least $1.05 billion worth of fiber from Corning, good enough to buy about 20 million kilometers worth over the length of the contract. As one can imagine after seeing the details of a massive deal like this, sales in the division are growing nicely, and increased 15% year over year in the company's third quarter. Corning scientists made the first low-loss optical fiber for commercial use in 1970 and the company produced its billionth kilometer of optical fiber during its third quarter. With that type of experience it's no wonder that, during the company's third-quarter conference call, CEO Wendell Weeks revealed Corning was the world's lowest cost producer of the material. Coupled with its great technical prowess and proprietary know-how in the area, that constitutes an impressive economic moat. Weeks said: ""Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind, anywhere in the world. ... We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate and to increase our market access ... These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry. ... We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020."" Corning scientists continue to innovate and test the limits of glass to stay ahead of the competition. Image source: Corning Inc. Last May, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook announced Corning would receive $200 million as the first recipient of the company's Advanced Manufacturing Fund, a fund conceived to spur innovation among American manufacturers. The money was going to Corning's manufacturing facility in Kentucky where it makes Gorilla Glass -- its tough, lightweight, and scratch-resistant glass that has been used to cover more than 5 billion devices from 40 different manufacturers, including every iPhone and iPad ever made. Corning's Specialty Materials division, where Gorilla Glass is accounted for, continues to show strong growth. In the company's third quarter, the segment's sales increased 26% and core earnings increased 61% year over year. While Gorilla Glass 5 (GG5), the fifth generation of Gorilla Glass, is now being used by virtually all major smartphone manufacturers, the company is also finding other uses for Gorilla Glass. Many wearable devices are now using Gorilla Glass SR+, a version specifically built for wearables. In the company's third-quarter conference call, Weeks also said Corning was exploring different uses for Gorilla Glass on 25 different automobile platforms. ""On the exteriors of cars, Gorilla Glass laminates are lighter and tougher than conventional auto glass, plus its superior optical quality allows larger, clearer head-up displays,"" Weeks said. ""For interiors, Gorilla Glass makes cars more connected and durable with sophisticated capabilities you come to expect from your smartphones."" Just before the company released its second-quarter earnings this year, Corning announced a new product, Valor Glass, a ""totally redesigned pharmaceutical package."" The new glass packaging is designed to improve glass lamella, what happens when tiny flakes of glass shed on the inside of the package and contaminate the medicine. The problem is so serious that the FDA has previously released warnings on it. Valor Glass packaging ""dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput."" The product has already been endorsed by major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). ""We believe that our collaboration with Corning is a game changer,"" Pfizer CEO Ian Read said. ""The glass industry represents about $4 billion in expenditures for the pharmaceutical industry, but subsequent issues, potential shards or breakages require strong quality control to ensure that it doesn't get through to patients."" In other words, Valor Glass is a potential $4 billion opportunity for Corning. Corning's year brought new opportunities and strong growth in the company's core competencies and, best of all, there are no signs these developments are about to slow down. Global demand for optical fiber continues to rise, smartphones and other applications for Gorilla Glass abound, and Valor Glass has yet to make any impact whatsoever to Corning's top and bottom lines. In other words, while 2017 was a year to remember for Corning, 2018 might be even better. ","

Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) likes to say it ""is empowering the wireless networking revolution."" While those are heady words, they might not be far from the truth. The company's innovative analog semiconductors enable devices like smartphones, wearables, and smart-home systems to stay connected. The company stands poised to capitalize on huge trends like the jump to 5G and the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT). In its most recent quarter, the company showed strong annual revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, up 18% and 15%, respectively, and guided for more double-digit percentage growth in the quarter ahead. On the surface, at least, Skyworks Solutions seems to have a lot going for it. It might be odd to think of a stock with a seemingly paltry 1.35% dividend yield as an income play, but there is more to dividend growth stocks than just a cursory glance at their yield. Skyworks Solutions grew its dividend by a healthy 14% this year. While double-digit increases are nothing to sneeze at, this year's growth does not reflect the explosive growth Skyworks' dividend has seen in recent years. Since 2015, it has increased its dividend by a whopping 146%! Let's take a closer look at the company's business prospects and fundamentals to see why I believe income investors should not ignore this reasonably priced and fast-growing dividend stock. SWKS Dividend data by YCharts Skyworks Solutions finds itself perfectly situated to capitalize on two huge coming trends: the explosive growth of the IoT and the massive upgrade to 5G wireless networks. Research firm IDC thinks worldwide spending on the IoT could increase to $1.4 trillion by 2021, up from $800 billion this year. In the Skyworks' fourth-quarter conference call, CEO Liam Griffin said there could be as many as 75 billion connected devices by 2025. These devices will include everything from wearables and smartphones to cars and refrigerators. These applications could not be possible without the type of connectivity solutions Skyworks offers. The Internet of Things might consist of 75 billion devices by 2025. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to IoT, wireless networks will begin to be upgraded to 5G as soon as next year. Last month, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) announced it would be rolling out the next generation in wireless networks in three to five domestic markets in 2018. In the company's fourth-quarter conference call, Griffin said 5G networks could be as much as 100 times faster than existing networks. This matters to Skyworks shareholders, because the solutions it designs for 5G networks are more profitable for the company than the chips it designs for networks of lesser speeds. In other words, as 5G wireless networks come online and the IoT continues to develop, Skyworks Solutions will sell more expensive chips in phones and provide more connectivity solutions to an ever-increasing number of devices. That's not a bad place to be for any company! Skyworks Solutions first caught my eye as an income investment in 2015, when it raised its dividend by 100%. It followed up that massive hike with a modest 8% raise in 2016 and a robust 14% increase this year. In this year's third-quarter conference call, transcribed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, CFO Kris Sennesael noted the company's strong balance sheet and said the goal is to give back about 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchasing shares: I feel good about the balance sheet. We have $1.4 billion of cash and no debt ... I feel really strong about our ability to generate cash. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow margin is approximately 31% ... [I]n terms of returning cash to the shareholders, our stated goal is that we want to return 40% to 50% of the free cash flow back to shareholders using our dividend program and share buyback program ... We are very active with our share buyback program. Last quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares, $129 million. And we have our dividend program which we announced today, that we increased it by 14%, increasing the dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.32 per share. Even though Skyworks has increased its dividend every year since initiating it in 2014, it still sports a low payout ratio. In its 2017 fiscal year, Skyworks reported $5.41 in EPS (on a GAAP basis), and it's projected to pay out $1.28 in dividends per share this year at the current quarterly rate of $0.32 per quarter. This means its payout ratio is only 24%! That leaves plenty of room for the company to buy back shares, reinvest for growth, and raise the dividend in the future as long as the company does not suffer a sudden and dramatic decrease in earnings. Given its position to benefit from 5G networks and the growth of IoT, such an event seems remote, to say the least. While Skyworks Solutions offers a below-average dividend yield, I believe it will be able to grow its dividend quickly as its earnings increase. Given its low payout ratio, this should not be an issue even in years it misses guidance or shows low growth. The company is still reasonably priced, too: On a GAAP basis, it is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.5, well below the S&P 500's average. On a non-GAAP basis, it's a downright bargain with a P/E of only 14.6. In a bull market getting long in the tooth, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a company showing strong growth, selling at a reasonable price, and featuring a dividend that has lots of room to grow in the years ahead.

425,Chris Neiger,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Technology trends are often difficult to nail down because, well, it's astonishingly hard to predict the future. But there are indicators from 2017 that point pretty strongly to what we can expect to see in the technology sector next year. While many of us think of technology in a very specific sense of the word (i.e., smartphones, drones, etc.) this tech trends list also includes more complex technology ideas like robotics, laser-transmitted internet, decentralized medical record systems, and other ideas a little bit off the well-worn tech path. If even half of these trends expand beyond where they're at right now, then we're in for a very exciting year. Image source: Getty Images. Blockchains are digital ledgers that can be shared and accessed by anyone to keep track of transactions between two parties. The term received lots of attention in 2017 because the cryptocurrency bitcoin uses one decentralized blockchain to keep track of all of its transactions. But the tech can be used far beyond Bitcoin. Some people want blockchains to be used for things like medical records, where a person's patient data would be stored in a cryptographic database that accepts information from multiple different medical databases and software programs. The benefit here is that a patient's personal medical history could be kept in one safe, decentralized location, and accessible to different doctors' offices and medical centers, without those offices or their software having to coordinate with each other to update the records. Image source: Getty Images. There's a lot of talk about artificial intelligence these days, but the real benefit for companies in 2018 will be the adoption of algorithms and computer intelligence that are good at doing one very specific task, which is commonly referred to as narrow artificial intelligence (AI). Narrow AI differs from general AI (think autonomous robots trying to take over the world) and allows computers to complete specific tasks, like driving a car, very well. Narrow AI is used in everything from language translation apps to content curation in Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Newsfeed, and in 2018, it's likely we'll see more companies use it to make their businesses more efficient and productive. Image source: The Boring Company. At the very end of 2016, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that we was starting a new company that would attempt to help solve the well-known traffic problems in Los Angeles, California. And last year, Musk's new Boring Company drilled a 500-foot long tunnel to test out a new underground system of moving passengers along high-speed tracks. The company could potentially use two types of underground transportation, the first being a track system that could move more than a dozen passengers between cities at up to 150 mph. The other is Musk's Hyperloop concept, which consists of pods that travel in a near-vacuum tube at up to 700 mph. The Boring Company is currently working on a 6.5-mile proof-of-concept tunnel in Los Angeles that, if it gets approval from the city, could eventually turn into an underground tunnel system in California. The company also began digging in Maryland toward the end of 2017 for another test track that could eventually become a underground transportation system between Washington, D.C., and New York City. The test tunnels won't be done in 2018, but we're certain to here much more about them in the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) began testing wireless 5G broadband in 2017, and in 2018, both companies say they'll launch limited commercial availability for the new service. Unlike 4G and LTE, 5G will mainly be used for home internet connections at first, allowing the telecoms to provide multiple-gigabit speeds via wireless connections to homes. For context, 1 gigabit speeds are 15 times faster than the average home broadband connections in the U.S. Not only are the speeds faster, but 5G offers less congestion for home internet connections as well (think of how slow it gets when you and your neighbors are all streaming movies on the same night) and has lower latency (it can send information very fast) than traditional cable internet connections. Verizon will bring 5G to Sacramento, California, and four other yet-to-be announced markets in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin's massive price gains toward the end of 2017 got the attention of investors and the general public, and we're likely to see more of the same in 2018. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that allows its owners to make purchases safely and anonymously, and as of this writing, the value of one bitcoin has jumped nearly 2,000% in 2017. Bitcoin is now accepted by some retailers, like Home Depot and Overstock.com, and it's likely that more retailers will jump on board next year, particularly if the value continues to rise. But bitcoin is still highly volatile, and its online exchanges (where you buy and sell bitcoin) are often the targets of hackers. All of this means we're probably just as likely to see bitcoin's value slide in 2018 as we are to see its price rise to new heights. Either way, expect to hear much more about the cryptocurrency in 2018. Image source: Apple. In 2017, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made some huge moves to bring augmented reality to its millions of iPhone and iPad users when it released iOS 11 with augmented reality capabilities. The tech giant now allows developers to create their augmented reality (AR) apps, like IKEA's Place app, which allows users to scan rooms in their home and add virtual furniture into it to see what it looks like. Facebook also took steps in 2017 to pave the way for more AR use on its platform next year as well. The company's new AR Studio allows developers to create filters and camera effects (think augmented reality masks for selfies) for its Facebook and Messenger apps, and it has expanded the use of AR filters in its Instragram app. The focus on mobile AR by Apple and Facebook is part of the reason an estimated 1 billion smartphone users are expected to create AR content on their phones next year, according to research from Deloitte. Image source: Waymo. Automakers and tech companies have been testing driverless cars for years, but in 2018, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) self-driving car company, Waymo, will make even more headway. Waymo has been testing its self-driving vehicle fleet in Phoenix, Arizona, for the past few months, but the company said recently that in a few months, it will launch a driverless car service in the city. That means Waymo's vehicles will pick up people on-demand, drop them off at destinations, and drive themselves around town without a human in the driver's seat. That's a big step forward for Waymo, and driverless car tech as a whole, and it means the company is a few years ahead of its competition. Most automakers and tech companies are targeting their self-driving car services for 2021. Image source: Getty Images. In 2017, a group of MIT scientists began work on a new type of solar panel technology called hot solar cells. These cells can be up to two times more efficient at converting sunlight into energy than typical photovoltaic solar panels because they use more advanced materials and have a superior process for capturing light. The hot solar cells essentially funnel light into carbon nanotubes, which then causes them to heat up to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, and then transfer than intense heat back into a focused light toward the solar cells. The process makes the cells much more efficient at turning light into energy than traditional solar panels, and it also offers the ability to siphon off some of the heat to be stored and converted into energy later. The hot solar cell research is still in its infancy, but it could help advance solar panel technology beyond conventional panels in the years to come. Image source: Amazon. Voice-enabled smart speakers like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo (with its Alexa virtual assistant) have been around since 2014, but at the end of 2017, they started to gain much more traction -- and that's likely to continue into 2018. These speakers can field questions about the weather, order online products, search the web, and even do things like order an Uber or have a pizza delivered. They can also be paired with other smart home products, like a thermostat, so users can control devices around the home using just their voice. The number of Americans who have used these types of devices has spiked nearly 130% from 2016 to 2017, and by 2020, more than half of U.S. households will have at least one smart home speaker, according to Juniper Research. All of which means that it's likely we'll see even more adoption of these voice-enabled smart speakers next year. Image source: Getty Images. Quantum computing is a difficult idea to understand, but the simplest explanation is that it uses the laws of quantum mechanics to allow computers to process information as both 1s and 0s at the same time, whereas conventional computers can only process information as either a 1 or a 0. This allows the computer to figure out multiple outcomes at once, instead of processing answers in a sequence. Because quantum computers can process information in this way, it makes them much more powerful than conventional computers. Google made some big strides in this space at the end of 2017, and it now offers free, open-source quantum computing software to chemists and material scientists. While current quantum computers are still in their early stages, companies believe they could soon be used to figure out the problems of climate change and make new medical discoveries. Google, IBM, Microsoft, and others are already knee-deep into quantum computing, and Google's latest software is compatible with IBM and other companies' quantum computers, which paves the way for more adoption of this tech next year.

Its da Vinci robot has been in use since 2000, but the company's patents are about to expire, and that's leaving the surgical robotics market wide open for other tech companies and major medical companies to step in. Surgical robots don't perform surgeries on their own, but are instead controlled by surgeons and enable to perform their work more precisely, in some cases. But these robots are also getting smarter. The Economist recently pointed out that Google has teamed up with Johnson & Johnson to release internet-enabled surgical robots, through a joint company called Verb Surgical, that will share data and video with other surgical robots like it, and then use machine learning to improve how surgeries are performed. With more companies jumping into this market, and Google helping to expand how these bots assist surgery, 2018 is sure to bring even more advancements. Image source: EHang. Many companies have been bullish about their ability to launch autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV) in big cities, but a China-based company called EHang is actually making the idea a reality in 2018. The company already has one-person prototype flying taxi right now, and it says it will start mass-producing flying taxis capable of carrying up to two passengers in 2018. The EHang E-184 looks like a large drone with a human-sized cabin on top, and can fly to pre-set destinations at up to 62 miles per hour and for up 25 minutes on its electric batteries. EHang already has a contract to bring the taxis to Dubai in 2018, and it is also in talks with cities across Europe. It's still unclear how common these flying taxis will become, but it looks like 2018 may be the year they actually become a reality. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's X research division is selling some of its high-tech laser beam technology to India's government next year so it can provide high-speed internet to millions of citizens. The devices use what's called ""space optical technology,"" and it consists of boxes that send and receive laser signals to each other to transmit internet signals, instead of using copper wire or fiber optics. The final internet signal is then sent to users via Wi-Fi or cellular signals. Since it uses light to send the signals, and nothing else, it's the ultimate wireless signal. A recent Reuters article said Alphabet will provide 2,000 of space optical boxes spaced about 12 mile apart from each other on rooftops and poles, capable of sending internet signals at 20 gigabits per second. Space optical technology typically suffers from weather-related obstacles (it doesn't like rain or fog), but Alphabet says its technology is already addressing some of these problems. Image source: Getty Images. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the phrase used for devices that have sensors, collect data, and connect to the Internet so the information they produce can be analyzed or used for automation. These devices can be anything from smartwatches like the Apple Watch to industrial machinery that sends a signal to a computer to tell it that a specific part is about to fail. There were 6.4 billion IoT devices used in 2016, and that number will reach 11.2 billion in 2018. As these devices increase and start taking over more industrial and enterprise systems, they need to become more secure and more easily updated. This is why it's likely that we'll see much more IoT platform software and improved security in the coming year. Many of these devices are small and inexpensive, which means cloud-based software and network-based security (directly from the cellular connections themselves) could be the key to a growing IoT market. Research firm Gartner says that starting in 2018, we should see much more higher-volume and lower-cost devices that will be used for everything from connected security systems to smart LED lighting. Image source: Magic Leap. Google debuted its augmented reality glasses, called Google Glass, back in 2012, but the device eventually crashed and burned among public scrutiny (they weirded people out), and after it failed to be useful enough for use by the general public. But Google has since released a newer version of its Glasses for enterprise use, and an augmented reality company it's backing called Magic Leap will launch its own pair of ""mixed reality"" glasses in 2018 as well. Magic Leap's glasses are called Lightwear, and they can be used to browse the internet, make conference calls, or play games. There's no price tag for the glasses yet, and they're intended to be purchased by software developers so that they create content and apps for the glasses. Magic Leap has received $1.9 billion in funding so far, and the debut of the much-anticipated Lightwear glasses is likely the first of many AR glass headlines we'll see in 2018. Of course, there's no way to know which of these tech trends, if any, will truly take off in 2018. But each of the above trends builds on current technological innovations, which means they're already more than just flash-in-the-pan ideas. If I had to bet on a few right now, I'd expect driverless cars, augmented reality, the expansion of IoT, and in-home virtual assistants to gain the most traction in the coming year. Just keep in mind I'm making these predictions sans a crystal ball. ","
      
    15 Tech Trends to Watch in 2018 -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9997
426,Rich Duprey,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The latest financial maneuvers by Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) are being spun as a way to give the failing retailer some breathing room to get its house in order, but in reality, they indicate just how dire its predicament is. Worse, they could put the retailer's retirees at even greater risk. Sears announced it was taking out additional loans totaling $607 million, with the proceeds being to be used to make a payment towards its pension obligations and for general corporate purposes. It also negotiated an extension to an existing loan that will see its repayment stretched out to next year, and possibly as far as mid-2019. Image source: Getty Images. One analyst wrote, ""Sears appears to be working very hard to prove that the company has the liquidity to pay their vendors,"" which seems to be an exceedingly charitable way of saying the retailer's not generating enough in sales on its own to pay them, so it has to take out loans to do so. That's not an encouraging development. Last quarter, same-store sales plunged by mid-teen rates at Sears and Kmart, an acceleration of the decline it's experienced over the past few years. While it narrowed its losses somewhat during the period, they still exceeded half a billion dollars. The Christmas season is typically the biggest for retailers, and Sears is no exception, but that's all relative, and having to arrange to have sufficient liquidity on hand after the holidays indicates Sears thinks more suppliers will want to break ties with them, as has happened over the past two years. While there's enough room for conjecture on whether taking out new loans to pay the bills is good for Sears or not, the financial gymnastics should have Sears retirees worried. Data source: Sears Holdings quarterly SEC filings. Chart by author. In March 2016, Sears entered into a five-year agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC) to protect the retailer's pension plans. In exchange for the PBGC not initiating an involuntary termination of its plans, Sears agreed to have the agency ""ring-fence"" various assets, or place a lien on them, to protect their value. One of those assets was Craftsman tools, and Sears had to get a waiver from the PBGC to allow it to sell the brand to Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) for $900 million. To do so, Sears agreed to use a $250 million payment it will be getting from Stanley three years after the deal closes for its pension contribution that would be counted towards its obligations for 2017, 2018, and 2019, and it would also contribute to the pension the 15-year stream of revenue it negotiated from Stanley. Sears pension plan is massively underfunded by some $1.5 billion as of the end of 2016. The retailer estimated that it would have to make a contribution to the plan of $312 million this year and $297 million next year. While it's uncertain how much of this year's obligation Sears has paid so far, the deal it just made with the PBGC will require it to make a $407 million payment to the pension plan, after which it won't have to make another one for two more years (it will need to make a $37 million payment this month and a $20 million supplemental payment in the second quarter of 2018). Earlier this year, Sears sought to ""de-risk"" its pension plan by transferring $515 million in pension liabilities to MetLife (NYSE:MET) by purchasing an annuity contract. Some 51,000 retirees will receive their full pension benefits from the insurance company rather than from Sears. It did it again in August when it purchased a second annuity contract for $512 million worth of liabilities that will have MetLife paying future benefits for 20,000 retirees. Other companies such as J.C. Penney, Kimberly-Clark, General Motors, and Verizon have made similar de-risking moves. While this relieves Sears of the obligations for the pension, improving its financial condition since pension contributions consume a large percentage of Sears available cash -- it has made $4.5 billion in pension contributions since merging Sears and Kmart -- it's not necessarily in the best interest of retirees since the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) no longer governs the benefit, and the PBGC no longer ensures it. Instead, various state agencies now oversee it. There is a good argument to be made that retirees who were switched over to MetLife are better off than those remaining at Sears since the insurer is a far healthier institution than is the retailer. Yet Sears is still effectively kicking its remaining pension plan can down the road for several years, during which time it will be selling off or further leveraging properties that are the assets financing the pension plan. Although it has, indeed, given itself some breathing room, all of those problems will come back with a vengeance when the time clock expires. Because its business is not improving but rather deteriorating more rapidly, assuming Sears is even around in two years, it will have to resort to further financial gymnastics to put out the new brush fires that will flare up. The retailer is taking out ever more loans to juggle its payments, but the fuse on its pension obligations is still burning as Sears runs out of both customers and cash. What Lampert has chosen to do is leverage the company with debt to buy it time, but at some point, the weight will become too heavy. When it collapses, it will be the retirees who are standing in the rubble. Rich has been a Fool since 1998 and writing for the site since 2004.

                                    are using Facebook ads to deter older workers from applying, according to a ProPublica and New York Times investigation. The ads reportedly target millennials specifically. In a statement, Rob Goldman, a Facebook vice president, said age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted practice, because if “used responsibly,” it helps employers recruit and find people of all ages. Other tech companies, like Google and LinkedIn, also allowed age-targeted job ads, ProPublica found. The news organization was able to buy job ads on those sites designed to exclude people 40 years and older. In response to ProPublica’s findings, LinkedIn has changed its process so that advertisers must self-certify that if the ad is related to employment, it does not discriminate based on age, a spokeswoman said. Once that box is checked, the ad can then target by age. Some companies defended the recruitment strategy: Target

Age discrimination can be hard to prove on the job, but during the hiring process, it’s even more difficult — the line isn’t as visible under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Employers can easily say they decided to go another way, or simply not reach out after receiving an application or resume, and there’s little evidence to show that it was because of a person’s age or graduation year. Why the disinterest? There are misconceptions about older workers, such as they will soon experience cognitive decline, which would affect their work, they are only looking for something temporary to fill their time until retirement, or they’re bad with technology, said Julie Ragatz, director of the Center for Ethics in Financial Services and assistant professor at the American College. See:  What to do if you’re an older worker offered a buyout Just how bad is it for older applicants? Displaced workers who are 50 years or older were unemployed for almost six weeks longer than someone between 30 and 49 years old, and more than 10 weeks longer than people between the ages of 20 and 29, according to a federal displaced worker survey from 2014. In one of the largest resume studies to date, with more than 40,000 resumes sent out to 13,000 job postings for retail, administrative assistant and other jobs in 12 cities, Patrick Button, a professor of Tulane University, and two colleagues found older applicants had the lowest level of callbacks, especially older female applicants. As a result, older unemployed Americans are seeing a different picture in the search for a job than others — especially if they’ve been unemployed for a while, regardless the fact there are a record high number of job openings and the unemployment rate is at all-time lows. A third of job seekers 55 and older are considered longtime unemployed (so out of work for more than six months), and the average time they’re unemployed is between seven and nine months. So what can older applicants do? Show off your web skills These days, having a strong online presence, especially for a job at a company with a strong online presence, is critical. At minimum, applicants should have a full and updated LinkedIn profile, said Phyllis Mufson, a career coach in Sarasota, Fla.

                                   and Instagram, but be attuned to the small ways to show you’re savvy on the web. Even something small, like a graphic in your email signature can catch a hiring manager’s eye. “Small things like that create an up-to-date impression,” Mufson said. Don’t take everything off the résumé First, always make sure your resume has a current format with important keywords. Resumes submitted online often go through a machine to check for words that match the job posting. That technology may become more advanced, Button said. He’s seen some people leave high school graduate years off of the résumé, though he’s not sure that’s a good idea — employers may end up asking later on anyway. Accentuate the skills you learned from your years in the workforce, and highlight any experience relevant to the position you’re applying for now. If you feel you must rewrite your resume, elaborate on recent achievements and new or ongoing education, Mufson said. Be attentive to inappropriate questions There are a few questions that flag ageism in the hiring process, according to the Society of Human Resources, such as “Would it be hard working for a boss younger than you?” and “Why would you want this job, given all your experience?” They tend to infer the hiring manager or interviewer assumes you’re too old for the job, or won’t be interested in it for long. Hiring discrimination is hard to document, but can be seen in job postings that ask for workers of specific ages, “recent graduate” or “college student,” or terms like “boy” or “girl,” according to a 1983 report from Stephen McConnell, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging. Other terms during the interview include “overqualified” and forced assumptions about long hours or workloads. Also see: Why a college degree could be one of the worst ways to find a new employee Practice for interviews Talk through potential questions and strong answers with a former colleague or boss, family member or friend, or career coach, and ask for feedback on ways you present yourself, Mufson suggests. Also beat any misconceptions about older workers by being energetic, expressing your interest in staying with the company for years to come and embracing change, Ragatz said. Don’t feel you have to change your physical appearance either, experts said. Remain calm Not everyone shares those misconceptions about working seniors. There are positive assumptions about older employees as well, such as having a good work ethic with good social skills, being loyal to their employers and having flexibility to do the work, Mufson said. Perhaps one of the most important reminders during the job search is to stay positive, Ragatz said. “Don’t be discouraged,” she said. “There is work that needs to be done.” This story was updated on Dec. 21, 2017.

A source told Reuters that the deal, which could come as soon as this week, will entail Verizon and Yahoo sharing the liability from potential lawsuits related to the data breaches. Another person familiar with the situation said the price cut was likely to be around $250 million, a figure that Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday. A representative from Verizon declined to comment. Yahoo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Maybe this isn’t quite as much of a discount as initially thought, but it’s at least something,” said Dave Heger, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones. Verizon hopes to combine Yahoo’s search, email and messenger assets, as well as advertising technology tools, with its AOL unit, which Verizon bought in 2015 for $4.4 billion. Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside an oversaturated wireless market. But Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo has been under scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers since disclosing the largest known data breach in history in December, months after disclosing a separate hack. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a probe into whether Yahoo should have disclosed the breaches, which occurred in 2013 and 2014, sooner, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal last month. On Wednesday, Yahoo sent a warning to users whose accounts may have been accessed by intruders between 2015 and 2016, as part of a data security issue related to the breach it disclosed in December. A person familiar with the matter said notifications have gone out to a mostly final list of users. Yahoo shares rose 1.5 percent to $45.69 in afternoon trading. Verizon shares fell 0.7 percent to $47.93. ","

429,,2162017,Reuters,2092017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc will introduce an unlimited data plan on Monday, its first in more than five years, in its latest effort to lure customers as competition rises between network carriers. The introductory plan, announced on Sunday, will give unlimited data to customers on smartphones and tablets on its 4G LTE network. It comes days after competitor Sprint Corp introduced a new unlimited data plan of its own. The unlimited option appears to be a change in direction for Verizon after one of the company’s top executives said last month it was not looking at unlimited products when asked by analysts whether Verizon needed to be more aggressive in the market. “We constantly look at... what’s out there. Unlimited is one of the things that some of our competition has at this point in time. That’s not something we feel the need to do,” Matthew Ellis, Verizon’s chief financial officer, told analysts during an earnings call on Jan. 24. “But as I say, we continually monitor the market and we will see where we head in the future,” he added. Verizon’s unlimited plan is $80 per month for unlimited data, talk and text for the first line with paper-free billing and autopay, and $45 per line for four lines. The company stopped offering unlimited data plans for most customers in 2011. (Story corrects pricing in paragraph 6.) ","

430,,2162017,Reuters,2092017,"(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc, the No.3 U.S. wireless carrier, reported quarterly profit and revenue above estimates as promotional offers helped add more subscribers. The company has been gaining market share from rivals Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and Sprint Corp, in an oversaturated U.S. wireless market. T-Mobile had a number of promotional offers in the fourth quarter, including a free iPhone 7 offer with eligible trade-in around Black Friday. But T-Mobile could face more competition following Verizon’s announcement this week that it would reintroduce an unlimited data plan as well as from a new promotion launched earlier by Sprint. On a conference call with analysts and investors, Chief Executive Officer John Legere dismissed such concerns. “The competitive environment so far is based upon moves that others are making out of desperation,” he said. Net income rose to $390 million, or 45 cents per share, for the quarter from $297 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 23.4 percent to $10.18 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of 30 cents per share and revenue of $9.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For 2017, T-Mobile expects branded postpaid net additions of 2.4 million to 3.4 million. Analysts said the numbers may be viewed as disappointing but noted that T-Mobile tends to give conservative forecasts at the beginning of the year. The company also expects free cash flow to grow between 45 percent to 48 percent annually for the next three years, in line with analyst estimates. Shares were roughly flat in Tuesday trading on the Nasdaq. Industry watchers have long speculated that T-Mobile and Sprint, the No. 3 and No. 4 biggest players in U.S. wireless, will combine. Asked last week about renewed merger talks with T-Mobile, Masayoshi Son, whose SoftBank Group Corp is a majority shareholder in Sprint, said he was keeping his options open. Legere said on the call in response to a question on Sprint that T-Mobile was “a very healthy growing franchise, and if we choose to, we can continue to drive tremendous shareholder value on our own or participate in various forms ... of consolidation.” T-Mobile, which had released its subscriber numbers for the quarter in January, added 933,000 postpaid phone subscribers, or those who pay monthly bills, on a net basis, in the three months ended Dec. 31. Churn, or customer defections, declined to 1.28 percent, from 1.46 percent a year ago. ","

431,,2162017,Reuters,2092017,"* US blue chips head for Taiwan to lock in flexible funding terms By Daniel Stanton SINGAPORE, Feb 13 (IFR) - Three US blue chips headed to Taiwan’s Formosa bond market last week in a rush to lock in flexible funding ahead of changes in local regulations and a potential shake-up in US tax rules. Verizon Communications issued a $1.475 billion 30-year non-call three bond at 4.95 percent, the largest Formosa issue of the year so far. Also last week, Apple was rumoured to be sounding investors for a potential $1 billion 30 non-call three, indicated at a yield in the 4.3 percent area, and Pfizer was heard to be eyeing the market, too. Global issuers are rushing to Taiwan before a local rule change in March that will effectively prevent them from offering securities with call dates of less than five years. However, US companies have an additional incentive to lock in the most flexible terms possible, with potential changes to the US tax code looming over the horizon. “A lot of issuers are thinking they want to get ahead of this,” said a foreign banker. “If something changes in the US tax rules, they can call back their bonds later.” Many US multinationals keep large piles of cash offshore to limit corporate tax payments and sell bonds to fund dividend payments or share buybacks. However, proposals to cut the US corporate tax rate and remove the deductibility of interest payments against income are likely to spur them to repatriate their cash and potentially reduce bond issuance. Such proposals are unlikely to become law before the end of this year, if at all, but, in the meantime, yield-hungry Taiwanese investors remain an attractive alternative source of US dollar funding. The Formosa market relies heavily on local life insurers, and foreign issuance has rocketed since 2014, when Taiwan’s Financial Services Commission reclassified Formosa bonds as domestic debt. Taiwanese insurers, which cannot invest more than 45 percent of their assets in foreign bonds, were, therefore, freed up to buy more dollar bonds listed in Taiwan. CALLING TIME Insurance investors typically prefer long maturities and the most popular tenor in the Formosa market is 30 years, but most bonds have call options, most commonly at three years. Still, the structure of Formosa bonds is about to change. Last month, the FSC said it would prohibit Taiwanese insurance companies from buying bonds with call options earlier than five years. Since insurers are, by far, the largest buyers of Formosa bonds with about an 80 percent share of all outstanding issues, according to a November estimate by asset manager PIMCO, issuers are expected to stick to non-call five structures after the new rule takes effect on March 25. That means US corporate issuers, in particular, are trying to take advantage of the short-dated call options available in the Formosa market while they can. That may also mean the mix of issuers looking to court Taiwanese investors may change after March. “I don’t think it will mean that we get fewer US corporates issuing into the Formosa market since the economics for them to issue dollars from an economic standpoint is still the most attractive,” said Rick Chan, EVP and portfolio manager, interest rate derivatives, at PIMCO. “There is a potential that it may be different names. We have seen a decrease in Formosa bond issuance from US financials with the slack being made up from Middle East issuers and other corporates. Pfizer, Apple and Vodafone are all working on potential deals this week, for example. The binding constraint will be more from the demand side.” However, another mooted rule change is expected to encourage issues from lower-rated names. Currently, it is impractical for life insurers to buy Formosa rated below Single A, as there are restrictions on how much lower-rated paper they can purchase. However, it is expected that requirement will be eased and it will soon be practical for them to buy Formosa rated BBB+ and above. That could be good news for some foreign financial issuers that want to raise capital in Taiwan, as they are now allowed to sell Tier 2 bonds there up to the same amount they have outstanding in senior bonds in the Formosa market. A head of DCM at a Taiwanese securities house said the huge expected supply of primary deals meant that investors could afford to be selective when it came to yields and industry sectors. “The market will continuously grow, while the demand still remains strong,” said the DCM head. “However, investors’ appetites for those foreign-denominated notes have almost reached their portfolio limit.” US dollar-denominated Formosa bonds tend to price in line with issues in the US dollar market, but undervalue the call option, making them relatively cheap for issuers. In theory, bonds with an embedded call option ought to pay a higher yield than those without, since issuers should pay extra for the option to redeem early and investors ought to be compensated for having their expected flow of coupon payments cut short. Investors in Taiwan and Asia, in general, have tended to take the view that, if a 30-year bond is called after three years, the extra yield over a typical three-year issue is compensation enough. Formosa bond issues are typically sized to meet demand, and investors usually buy and hold.   (Reporting by Daniel Stanton; Editing by Vincent Baby and Steve Garton) ","

432,,2162017,Reuters,2092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said Friday that bidding in the wireless spectrum auction has ended at $19.6 billion, significantly less than many analysts had initially forecast. The so-called broadcast incentive spectrum auction is one of the commission’s most complex and ambitious to date and should be complete by April. The FCC said last year that 62 bidders made upfront payments to take part, including AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Dish Network Corp, T-Mobile US Inc and Comcast Corp. Of the nearly $20 billion raised, more than $6 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit, more than $10 billion will go to broadcasters that chose to relinquish spectrum rights, and up to $1.75 billion for other broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. The final price for 84 megahertz of spectrum could rise above $20 billion as buyers may hike final bids for specific frequency blocks before the sale is complete. In June, the FCC said sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz of television airwaves taken from broadcasters to be sold for wireless use. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn substantially more in the auction, with some forecasting in 2016 $30 billion in proceeds. Twentieth-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox Television unit said this week it would receive about $350 million in proceeds from spectrum sales. Tribune Media Co said it expects $190 million in proceeds from the auction. Gray Television Inc said it expects to receive $90.8 million and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc expects to receive $313 million. Others did not participate. E. W. Scripps Co said Friday it had opted not to take part because it thought prices were too low. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the closing of bidding is a “major milestone,” adding the spectrum will boost wireless service. “These low-band airwaves will improve wireless coverage across the country and will play a particularly important role in deploying mobile broadband services in rural areas,” Pai said.

433,,2162017,Reuters,2092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission under President Donald Trump is keeping under wraps his strategy to revise or reverse the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules, but emphasized he is committed to ensuring an open internet. Ajit Pai, 44, a Republican lawyer who has served as a FCC commissioner since 2012, strongly opposed former Democratic President Barack Obama administration’s 2015 net neutrality rules that reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility. “I believe, as I think most Americans do, in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that,” Pai said in an interview in his FCC office, where several storage boxes remain to be unpacked. “Before the imposition of these Depression-era rules, we had for 20 years a bipartisan consensus on a regulatory model.” In December Pai vowed to take a “weedwacker” to unneeded rules and has not backed away from his prior criticism of net neutrality, when he again said net neutrality’s “days are numbered.” [nL1N1E21DU] The net neutrality rules bar internet access providers from slowing consumer access to web content. A federal appeals court upheld the rules last year. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely, while websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. Unlike Trump, Pai cannot simply issue an order doing away with the net neutrality rules, but must go through an administrative process. Pai is keeping his cards close to the vest, only saying he will mount a “careful look at the regulatory framework.” Last month, then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said reversing the net neutrality rules “is not a slam dunk” and will face the “high hurdle” of “a fact-based showing that so much has changed in just two short years that a reversal is justified.” Pai faces opposition on Capitol Hill and from many on social media to reversing net neutrality, with Democrats urging him not to favor the “big broadband barons” as one called them. “There is no problem that needs to be fixed,” said Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. “Net neutrality rules ensure those with the best ideas, not simply the best-funded ideas, have the opportunity to share their content with the world.” Pai said in 2015 that the FCC had adopted the sweeping new net neutrality rules at Obama’s behest and would result in “higher broadband prices, slower speeds, less broadband deployment, less innovation, and fewer options for American consumers.” Pai’s goal is “a modern flexible framework that gives everybody a level playing field.”Wheeler last month urged the next FCC not to “undo something that is demonstrably working” and says broadband investment has remained high. Earlier this week, a key Republican on telecommunications policy, Representative Marsha Blackburn said Congress will let the FCC “make the first move” on net neutrality. Last Friday, Pai sent letters to Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc to notify them that the FCC was closing investigations into “sponsored data” or “zero rating” programs in which mobile phone companies give customers free data for using certain video services. FCC had previously raised concerns about their data policies. “My position is the government should not be in the position of prohibiting companies in a competitive marketplace from offering free data,” Pai said. Pai has taken steps to make the FCC more transparent, including a pilot program to circulate proposals before they voted on. “A lot of involves divestment of power from the chairman’s office,” he said.

On a call with analysts Wednesday, CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said that CBS was in talks with the NFL about new formats to speed up games to help with ratings, but he said CBS would not cut ads. “If there are ways to do advertising in different ways, we are looking at that,” Moonves said. Moonves emphasized he still views NFL as “the premier property in all of media.” CBS, which is home to popular shows such as “NCIS” and “The Big Bang Theory,” has been facing a slowdown in its advertising revenue as advertisers shift more dollars from TV to online. To address this, the New York-based broadcaster, which also owns cable network Showtime, is focused on shifting its revenue stream from advertising to streaming video providers as more viewers watch their favorites shows online. CBS said it is on track to exceed its goal of having 8 million subscribers for its online streaming video service, All Access, and its online streaming Showtime service by 2020. Overall, the company said advertising benefited in the quarter from political spending at local television stations in the wake of U.S. presidential elections late last year. The company is very close to renewing its hit, “The Big Bang Theory” for another two years, Moonves said on a post-earnings call. The company earned $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of $1.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue fell 2 percent to $3.52 billion.

Trump vowed last Thursday to make a major tax announcement over the next few weeks, adding fuel to a rally that had stalled amid worries about the potential impact of his protectionist trade stance and a lack of clarity about other policy reforms. The S&P 500 has surged about 9 percent since Trump’s Nov. 8 election, boosted by expectations he would lower corporate taxes, ease regulations governing banks and increase infrastructure spending. Trump has also held high-profile meetings with senior executives from automakers and Silicon Valley technology companies. “Day after day, corporate executives from a variety of industries are being brought to the White House to consult with the president. Business does seem to be back in the driver’s seat, and I think that’s why people are willing to pay up a little bit more for stocks,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. Strong economic data in recent weeks has been supported by upbeat corporate results. S&P 500 companies are on track for their strongest profit growth in nine quarters, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “What is underlying this whole Trump rhetoric is that fundamentals in the world, including the U.S., are getting better,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

According to the telecom news website, Verizon confirmed the moves while also confirming it is increasing its activation and upgrade fees to $30 from $20. The move to get rid of two-year contracts comes at a time when most wireless carriers are scraping those plans in favor of EIPs, in which the price of the smartphone is separate than the price for wireless service. With an EIP, customers don’t get hit with interest on the phone and pay off their smartphones on a per-month basis for one, two or three years.

For the period ended Dec. 31, Charter reported net income of $454 million, or $1.67 a share, which compares to a loss of $122 million or $1.21 a share in the year-earlier fourth quarter. Analysts, according to FactSet had expected Charter to weigh in with earnings of $1.05 a share. Revenue of $10.28 billion was also higher than the analyst consensus for revenue of $10.23 billion. During the quarter, Charter said it added 345,000 customers, but it lost 51,000 on the video side. In its residential business, Charter said video revenue increased 1.9% while internet revenue increased 13.3% and revenue from its voice business declined 0.5% from last year’s fourth quarter. Charter recently acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Cable, which expands its footprint in the broadband and cable markets. (See also: Charter and TWC Receive FTC Merger Approval.) The decline in video subscribers comes at a time when countless consumers are cutting the cord on their set-top boxes, favoring streaming video content that doesn't require a costly device. There are fears in the marketplace cable companies are going to lose more customers to over-the-top streaming video services. “Since the close of our transactions in May, we have been managing the complicated process of integrating three different companies with over 26 million customers and 90 thousand employees. Despite the complexity, our integration is going well.

The fee, known as the “Broadcast TV Fee” can be anywhere from $3 to $6 a month and, according to Motley Fool, cable operators pass on the fees they have to pay local channels to rebroadcast their signals. Customers of both Charter and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) can’t waive or decline the fee even if they get rid of local channels, noted the report. Charter has started passing that fee on to new customers it acquired via the two cable system buys, with some customers in Massachusetts receiving notices that they have to pay the broadcast fee. MassLive.com reported customers were informed they would have to pay a $4.47 a month local broadcast TV surcharge starting in February. For Charter, news of new fees isn’t likely to sit well with consumers who are increasingly balking at increased fees and are looking for ways to cut the cord from their set-top boxes and satellite dishes. It doesn’t help that Charter and Comcast are among the most hated companies in America, according to 24/7 Wall St.’s annual rankings. Holding the rank of 12th-most hated company in America, 24/7 Wall Street said Charter scored below average in customer service for both the fixed-line telephone industry and the internet provider market, owning one of the poorest customer-service reputations in the subscription-television service industry. It doesn’t help that Comcast acquired Time Warner Cable, another outfit with a bad customer-service reputation, adding to its woes. (See also: Comcast, Sprint, DISH, Charter on Most-Hated List.)

Mark Cooper, CFA’s director of research and the author of the report, said a typical household with two wireless subscriptions, a landline, broadband service and multichannel video, will face a total overcharge of about $45 per month, or $540 per year.

This breach was previously revealed in a December 2016 statement from Yahoo that also provided information on a separate hack that occurred in August 2013 involving more than 1 billion accounts.

The company's revenue grew by only 3.2% on a year-over-year basis to $34.25 billion, but it made strong gains in customer growth, adding 1.5 million wireless subscribers in the quarter. Additionally, postpaid churn rate (the rate at which customers leave) was just 0.96%. The company also added 99,000 new net FiOS wireline customers and 20,000 FiOS video customers, year-over-year increases of 6.3% and 3.2%, respectively. Verizon's stock price suffered several setbacks throughout the year, mainly due to an employee strike and news of several hacking instances at Yahoo, which Verizon is currently in the process of buying. But it was likely the company's overall stability, and its 4% dividend yield at the time, that kept investors interested in the stock. The company's slow and steady growth has been paired with its increasingly strong network position, which was shored up this past year when Verizon purchased the fiber optic company XO Communications.

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has finally followed T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) in offering unlimited data for its customers. The company, along with rival AT&T (NYSE:T) had been a holdout in offering unlimited data largely because of how much money it makes from both overages and people buying larger plans than they actually use. In announcing the new offer via a press release, the company congratulated itself while taking a shot at T-Mobile which now offers only unlimited plans. ""We've built our network so we can manage all the activity customers undertake. Everything we've done is to provide the best experience on the best network – and we've built it for the future, not just for today,"" said Verizon Wireless President Ronan Dunne. ""We also fundamentally want you to have more choice. We're not limiting you to a single plan. If you don't need unlimited data, we still have 5 GB, S, M, and L Verizon plans that are perfect for you."" Offering unlimited of course is only one piece of the puzzle. Consumers also care about the quality of the network and perhaps most importantly how much they will pay. Verizon has become the latest carrier to offer unlimited data. Image source: Getty Images. There was a time when Verizon had a clear advantage when it came to the quality of its network. That's largely no longer true, at least when it comes to T-Mobile. In the just-released OpenSignal State of Mobile Networks: USA report T-Mobile and Verizon rate as the top two networks. The two companies tied for the top spot in both 4G download speeds and overall download speeds. Verizon took first place in ""Latency: 4G"" and ""Availability: 4G"" while T-Mobile won for ""Latency 3G"" and ""Availability: 3G."" Neither AT&T nor Sprint took first place in any category. Essentially T-Mobile and Verizon have the best networks. ""It's a draw,"" OpenSignal declares at one point in its report which ""parsed 4.6 billion measurements collected by 169,683 smartphone users in the fourth quarter of 2016 to gauge the 3G and 4G performance of national operators AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon."" It is worth noting that while Verizon and T-Mobile are the clear leaders, AT&T and Sprint are not far behind. How that translates into actual use scenarios varies based on where you live and how much/where you travel, but Sprint is not being outrageous in its commercials that claim Verizon customers are paying more for a network that's 1% better. Pricing for unlimited plans can be a bit of a moving target since Sprint and T-Mobile sometimes offer specials. It's also worth noting that the three carriers which offer unlimited plans to any customer who wants them have caveats allowing them to slow down data for the heaviest users at various times. These are the current offers as of Feb. 13, 2017: Verizon: The newest player in the unlimited space is offering one line for $80, two for $70 each ($140), three for $54 each ($162), and four for $45 a line ($180). Those prices require enrollment in auto-pay and do not include fees. AT&T: AT&T only offers unlimited data to grandfathered customers who had it before they dropped the plans and customers who bundle it with DirecTV. Sprint: The #4 wireless carrier by size has a limited-time promotion offering five lines for $90 through March 31, 2018. That breaks down to a first line for $50 a month, a second for $40, then up to three lines for free. Those prices require autopay and do not include fees. After the promotion ends customers will pay $60 for the first line, $40 for a second, then $30 for each additional line up to 5 in total. T-Mobile: T-Mobile's plans also require autopay enrollment, but unlike its rivals they are all-inclusive prices which include all fees and taxes. The company charges $70 for one line, $120 for two ($60 each), $140 for three ($46.67 each), and $160 for four ($40 each). Sprint has the lowest price, at least for a little more than a year, through its special offer. The carrier has the lowest single-line price, and the best deal on plans of up to five lines. T-Mobile comes in second when it comes to price -- though it's closer than it appears because of taxes (which vary by market) -- but its deal is not a special offer that expires. When you consider that T-Mobile ties as the top-rated network, it's probably worth it for anyone with one or two lines to go with T-Mobile, while anyone with three to five lines might consider Sprint as the savings start to pile up when you add the extra phones. What's clear is that while Verizon has joined the unlimited party, it's not offering a particularly good deal. Sprint has a much cheaper price while T-Mobile offers a better price along with a comparable network. ","

Management cited an increasingly competitive market for the weak results. Many customers are paying off equipment agreements and keeping their old devices in lieu of upgrading to a newer model. The slowdown in the retail wireless business, Verizon's largest segment, can be seen when comparing the year-over-year numbers. The slowdown in net additions has been accelerating. Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings reports. For the year ahead, the company expects the negative trends to improve. However, management said that will roughly equate into revenue and profit flat with 2016. The good news for investors is that Verizon knows this and has been leading the charge into new businesses to set the stage for future growth. Specifically, the company has been making a foray into the media business, making Internet of Things (IoT) acquisitions, and making progress on its 5G network. The company is gearing up for a new round of growth as people change the way they do business, communicate, and consume entertainment. Verizon made its first push into the media business with its purchase of AOL in 2015. Management reports they are satisfied with that new segment's progress and strides were taken in the last year to bolster it further. A pending purchase of Yahoo! was the big headline last year, but that deal is being reviewed in light of data breaches revealed late in the year. Several smaller media acquisitions were made last year as well. Among them were Complex Media, an online multimedia platform catering to young male trendsetters, and Volicon, a service that helps media companies with monitoring and compliance. The digital media arm led by AOL declined 5% in the fourth quarter due to a particularly strong comparable period last year. IoT continues to be a buzzword in the tech world, and Verizon made several moves to solidify itself as a provider of connected services in that space. Telogis and FleetMatics were both incorporated into the telematics business to provide services for connected vehicles and fleets. Verizon also bought a couple of start-ups that provide connected lighting and monitoring systems and urban Wi-Fi hubs. The IoT business grew 21% on a comparable basis in the last quarter of the year and over 60% including acquisitions. The backbone of the IoT in the years ahead is expected to be a new 5G network. Verizon is leading the way with trial tests of its yet-to-be-released wireless platform, but it is progressing toward making it a reality. The merger with fiber optic provider XO Communications is expected to be finalized this quarter and is a key part of the company's goals in densifying its current 4G LTE network and supporting the next-gen network. The vast majority of Verizon's business still comes from retail wireless and wireline business, so investors will want to keep tabs on that. However, those models are becoming stale, and it hurt the top and bottom lines last year. It's time to give increased attention to the new growth businesses Verizon has developed. Data by YCharts. It may take some time to pay off, but multimedia, the IoT, and a 5G network will be the backbone of Verizon's growth strategy going forward.

The company, which is responsible for moving about 40% of all natural gas in the U.S., became a target of skeptics, given the high levels of debt it had built up by expanding its leading pipeline network. When commodity prices fell, there was concern that Kinder Morgan's backlog and ability to net future deals would falter. These concerns were further magnified when it cut its dividend payout by 74% in December 2015. But there are reasons to believe that its balance sheet has improved dramatically, and that it's healthier than it's been in years as a company. Kinder Morgan wound up jettisoning a number of non-core assets last year, which, when combined with its dividend cut that'll save the company more than $3 billion a year in distributions, allowed it to handily reduce its outstanding debt. Between the beginning of 2015 and the end of the third quarter of 2016, Kinder Morgan chopped about $3.9 billion off its outstanding debt load, reducing it to $38.5 billion and likely saving face with investors and credit agencies. Best of all, there's probably no need to tap equity markets, given the operating cash flow from its existing pipelines and its now reduced debt levels. The other factor to really like about Kinder Morgan is that 91% of its cash flows are fee-based in 2017, and 97% overall is fee-based or hedged. In other words, it has very little exposure to what's been a pretty volatile crude and natural gas market over the past three years. Given the long-term nature of the company's contracts, it's able to generate pretty predictable cash flow each and every quarter. With crude and natural gas prices stabilizing in recent months, and President Donald Trump seeming to favor a strong domestic energy industry, Kinder Morgan could be the perfect Buffett stock for investors to consider scooping up in February. Jamal Carnette, CFA (Verizon Communications): In 2014, when it was disclosed that Warren Buffett had purchased a stake in Verizon, the general reaction was one of bewilderment. On the surface, there were a host of red flags that would make the average value investor nervous. First off, at that time Verizon was less than a year removed from the largest corporate bond issuance ever, a balance sheet-busting $49 billion offering. Second, earlier that year Big Red had issued 1.3 billion shares, watering down existing shareholders. Finally, Verizon had averaged top-line growth of only 2.8% in the aftermath of the Great Recession. An astute financial writer (spoiler alert: It was me) summed up the purchase by asking, ""Has He Lost His Mind?"" (Second spoiler alert: no). Of course, we know Buffett is no average value investor. I also have to point out the reason for the share and debt issuance -- Verizon didn't fully own its cash-cow Verizon Wireless business. The cash was needed to buy Vodafone's 45% stake. At the time, CEO Lowell McAdam estimated that the transaction would boost earnings 10%. Since then, however, the wireless industry has become more competitive, as upstart T-Mobile has been effective at lowering prices and instituting other consumer-friendly policies that have hit industry margins. T-Mobile's market dynamic-changing run almost didn't occur. In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission rejected AT&T's bid for T-Mobile because of concerns over a concentrated market. In 2014, the FCC again disallowed another suitor, this time Sprint, from purchasing T-Mobile, in an effort to protect consumers. It's likely the new FCC will be friendlier to mergers, and Bloomberg reports that Sprint remains an interested buyer. An acquisition will not be good for consumers, but it should help alleviate pricing pressures in the wireless industry, which is something Verizon shareholders would welcome. In addition, the new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a fierce opponent of net neutrality. As an internet service provider (ISP), Verizon is well positioned to take advantage of any watering down of these rules. Verizon now owns a host of digital properties and could better take advantage of both content and delivery if the net-neutrality rules are repealed. There will be losers for sure, though, most notably small bloggers and digital publishers, as power would shift to ISPs and larger publishers. Still, a recent poor quarter from Verizon gives long-term investors a great entry point. Currently, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 times earnings with a dividend yield of 4.7%. For value investors in the vein of Buffett, Verizon looks appealing at these levels. Tyler Crowe (General Electric): Buffett isn't a huge fan of technology stocks. Yet there's one company in his portfolio that's making a big bet on one of the hottest technology trends today: the Internet of Things. Sure, General Electric's developing Predix analytics platform and cloud-based services aren't the kind of technologies you and I will use every day, but its industrial applications will probably have a profound impact on how we operate machinery for decades to come. Predix, and General Electric's more broad strategy of creating an Industrial Internet of Things, is looking to completely change the way we think about things such as maintenance and operational efficiency. As the software platform's name suggests, it's able to predict maintenance issues before they happen, and run systems such as power generators at rates that optimize efficiency thanks to remote sensing and some serious cloud-computing capacity. This ability has been shown to save GE customers millions in maintenance costs, which makes it such a compelling business segment for GE. Management estimates that its Predix software and data-analytics business segment will bring in $15 billion in annual revenue by 2020. This business has also been shown to be a much higher-profit-margin business than its typical manufactured products are. If this business segment can achieve these lofty goals, then things will be looking pretty good for General Electric investors. I'm sure that when Buffett made his initial investment in the company, Predix wasn't really part of the equation. Now that it is, though, it should give him all the more reason to hang on to this stock. It also makes GE a compelling investment for anyone else today. ","
      
    3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in February -- The Motley Fool

446,Chris Neiger,2162017,Fool,2092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The technology sector isn't always the best place for investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain steady, long-term investments: Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Image source: Getty Images. Verizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of long-term potential in the IoT. The company already dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat competition from AT&T and T-Mobile, and it's only getting stronger. Verizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and says that it will use the network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and other city systems online. Over the next few months, the company plans on rolling out commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he believes the company is two to three years ahead of the competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO Communications. 5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off down the road. Cisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot. Cisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but one of biggest moves came early last year when the company announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion. Jasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows enterprise and service customers to ""launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale."" In short, Jasper allows companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet engines) and then manage those connections through its proprietary software. Jasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around the world that have devices running on 27 service providers. And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions, and advanced analytics. With Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the traditionally cyclical hardware market. Alphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and its quarterly revenues north of  $26 billion, this is certainly a company investors don't need to babysit. Most of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home, along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections. But one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from a company called Waymo, which was recently spun out of Google. Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company to now stand on its own and start generating revenue. Waymo has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans. On top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring IoT possibilities, like using nanoparticles to find diseases in the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices. Investors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook the massive opportunities that the IoT has to offer. Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of stable existing businesses. ","
      
    3 Internet of Things Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit -- The Motley Fool

447,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",2162017,Fool,2092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. We're just over a month into 2017, so let's look at how the Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) stock portfolio has done thus far. Berkshire itself is almost completely flat for the year, down 0.09% as of this writing, but some of the company's stock holdings have done quite well. Specifically, five of Berkshire's stocks have gained 10% or more over the first five weeks of the year. Company Stock Symbol Share Price (2/7/2017) YTD Performance Liberty Media (A Shares) LBTYA $35.54 +16.2% Moody's Corp. MCO $107.06 +13.6% Apple AAPL $131.53 +13.5% Charter Communications CHTR $323.37 +12.3% Visa V $85.78 +10% Performance and share prices as of market close on 2/7/2017. Image Source: Getty Images. Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LBTYK) has been Berkshire's biggest winner thus far in 2017, thanks to impressive growth in its European markets. The company expects the growth to continue as it speeds up its U.K. build activity and makes major investments in its business there. In addition, the company has been aggressively repurchasing its shares, especially in the wake of the Brexit sell-off last year. Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) has steadily climbed so far in 2017, partially because of its announcement that it had resolved pending civil claims with the Justice Department, 21 states, and D.C. Not only were the claims resolved faster than many experts expected, but the cost to the company will be significantly less than many expected. In part, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) rally has been due to its strong results from the holiday shopping season. For the quarter, Apple's revenue of $78.4 billion was as high as it has ever been, and the company's earnings and revenue both handily exceeded expectations. Perhaps most importantly, Apple's service revenue (which includes sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and others) grew by 18% year-over-year. While this accounts for just 9% of the company's results, it is rapidly becoming an important revenue stream to the company. Furthermore, Apple expects revenue to continue to climb in the current quarter, and CEO Tim Cook said that the company is ""excited"" about the products in its pipeline. In Charter Communications' (NASDAQ:CHTR) case, the reason for the strong stock performance wasn't necessarily due to strong growth or other great business metrics. Rather, the stock spiked in mid-January on rumors that Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was considering an acquisition of the company. Many think that the deal is unlikely to happen, for reasons my colleague Anders Bylund explained in a recent article, but the rumors have not faded just yet. In its latest quarterly report, Visa (NYSE:V) reported impressive year-over-year earnings growth of 7%, and revenue growth of 25% thanks to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Service revenue, data processing revenue, and international transaction revenue all soared, and while operating expenses grew by 16%, the company still posted impressive growth. For fiscal year 2017, the company expects net revenue growth of 16%-18%, and EPS growth in the ""mid-teens"" on an adjusted basis. It's fair to say that Visa's fiscal 2017 -- the most recent quarter was the first of its fiscal year -- is going well so far. To be clear, I'm not saying that you should buy these, or any other stocks simply because Warren Buffett owns them. However, Berkshire invested in each of these companies for a reason, and we can learn valuable investing lessons from these purchases, as well as from how the stocks perform over time. Having said that, I would have to call Apple the best buy on this list right now, as it still trades for a compelling valuation even after the recent rally, and I tend to gravitate toward undisputed leaders in their markets.

    Warren Buffett's Best Stocks of 2017 So Far -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9992
448,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",2162017,Fool,2092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. According to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to. Here's the answer. While we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth quarter. Here are the most notable buys: Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Apple -- Berkshire already owned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstanding Apple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from Buffett himself. This investment did not surprise me at all. I've written before how Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management agreed. 2. Airlines -- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments several times in his career, During the third quarter, Berkshire invested in American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter. At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed, Buffett also said he made an investment in Southwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's a stake worth more than $2 billion. 3. Monsanto -- Berkshire revealed a new stake in Monsanto, of about 8 million shares valued at about $872 million. Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share. If the deal goes through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinced at this point. 4. Sirius XM -- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167 million-share position in satellite radio operator Sirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment. 1. Wal-Mart -- Buffett has been gradually trimming his Wal-Mart stake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like. 2. Verizon -- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares of Verizon during the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded its AT&T stake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise. 3. Kinder Morgan -- Buffett bought about 20 million shares of Kinder Morgan in early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016 lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not looking attractive to Buffett anymore. 4. Deere -- Just like Kinder Morgan, Deere has rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be due to a valuation issue as well. You shouldn't necessarily follow Buffett's moves. For one thing, by the time we hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market. Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly 17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than investors could get now. ^SPX data by YCharts ","

Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said he believes Verizon’s reversal was “clearly in response to a more competitive environment,” is an indication that Verizon acknowledges that revenue growth will remain “anemic,” and that Verizon will have to go “outside the industry” to find growth. “As the industry adopts unlimited data plans, revenue growth should prove elusive,” Kvaal wrote. Morgan Stanley analyst Simon Flannery said what he’s most surprised about, is that after being adamant in recent years about not offering unlimited plans, Verizon has gone “all in” with a full nationwide rollout with full high-definition video. “It seems Verizon has decided that it needed to step up the level of competitive intensity,” Flannery wrote. “Weak subscriber trends and customer demands for hassle free data plans likely drove this aggressive move.” Meanwhile, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said Verizon’s move sends a “very strong signal” about the strength in its network, and puts Verizon “back in the conversation” for new users. “This announcement is significant as it offers a ‘fightback’ moment for the company,” Fritzsche wrote. Fritzsche said email exchanges with Verizon management indicated there was no change to the company’s 2017 outlook, which implies that this unlimited plan was in the works for a while, despite recent management comments to the contrary.

Among other moves Buffett’s Berkshire made during the fourth quarter, it slashed its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

With the soaring demand for ITaaS operational models, the scope for incorporating B2B telecommunications is also extending substantially among varied businesses and enterprises. A recent research conducted by Future Market Insights projects that the global demand for B2B telecommunication [http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/b2b-telecommunication-market ] will be largely emanating from the BFSI sector and media & entertainment industry.  According to Future Market Insights' report, the global revenues from B2B telecommunication surpassed an estimated US$ 30 billion in 2016. By the end of 2026, the global B2B telecommunication market is projected to be valued at US$ 107.47 billion, registering expansion at a 13.6% CAGR. More than one-fourth of the global B2B telecommunication revenues throughout the forecast period will be accounted by the BFSI industrial vertical, which will amount to more than US$ 27 billion by the end of 2026. Government and administrative bodies, and healthcare organisations such as hospitals and medical research institutes will also considered lucrative industrial verticals for B2B telecommunication, procuring a combined global market value share of nearly 30% by the end of forecast period. Growth in B2B telecommunication revenues from the media & entertainment industry is predicted to be at a faster pace - with a CAGR of 14.7%.

While cloud-based B2B telecommunication services currently account for half of the global market revenues, their revenue share is expected to drop over the period of next ten years. Increasing adoption of unified communication and collaboration solutions is predicted to partly instrument the dip in cloud services' global market contribution. By 2026, nearly US$ 25 billion revenues are projected to be harvested globally from sales of unified B2B telecommunication services. Furthermore, the demand for VoIP services, WAN solutions and M2M communication solutions is also expected to grow at steady rate over the next decade.

Surging adoption of cloud and VoIP services by US-based businesses has been assessed as the key attributor for growing sales of B2B telecommunication services in North America. Although, B2B telecommunication revenues in North America will increase at a 15.3% CAGR. On the other hand, the B2B telecommunication market in Asia Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) region is projected to register rampant expansion at the highest CAGR of 17.3%. By 2026-end, the APEJ B2B telecommunication businesses will dominate the global B2B telecommunication market with 28.5% global revenue share. Comparatively, the B2B telecommunication market in Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East & Africa (MEA) region will incur sluggish expansion over the forecast period. Japan's contribution to the global B2B telecommunication market value is estimated to be over US$ 15 billion by the end of 2026, which will be approximately US$ 3 billion higher than the value of Western Europe's B2B telecommunication market.

452,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"The closing of the deal, which was first announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the agreement following the attacks. Verizon and Yahoo signed the deal on Sunday evening after weeks of talks that included calls with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and a meeting between Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam and Yahoo director Tom McInerney in New York earlier this month to agree on the amount of the price reduction, a person involved in the talks said. The two sides had an agreement in principle about a week earlier that included a liability sharing agreement, something that Verizon decided early on that it needed to reach a deal. Verizon conducted brand studies and found that Yahoo’s reputation was holding up after the hacks, the person said. The company decided to proceed in part because it continued to believe that the deal made strategic sense and that users were loyal and engaged. The companies said on Tuesday they expect the deal to close in the second quarter. The data breach may delay some integration of Yahoo with Verizon after the closing, the person said. The deal brings to Verizon Yahoo’s more than 1 billion users and a wealth of data it can use to offer more targeted advertising. Verizon will combine Yahoo’s advertising technology tools as well as its search, email and messenger assets with its AOL unit, purchased for $4.4 billion in 2015. Verizon’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $49.33 in afternoon trading, while Yahoo’s shares were up 0.8 percent at $45.48. Under the amended terms, Yahoo and Verizon will split cash liabilities related to some government investigations and third-party litigation related to the breaches. Yahoo, however, will continue to be responsible for liabilities from shareholder lawsuits and SEC investigations. Yahoo said in December that data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history. This followed the company’s disclosure in September that at least 500 million accounts were affected in another breach in 2014. ","

453,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc said on Wednesday it would offer its high-speed wireless 5G network to certain customers in 11 U.S. cities in the first half of 2017. Verizon will begin pilot testing 5G “pre-commercial services” in cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Seattle and Washington, D.C. The company had said last July that it laid out plans to conduct trials for its 5G network this year. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and up to maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks, with the potential to connect at least 100 billion devices with download speeds that can reach 10 gigabits per second. AT&T Inc said in January that it planned to test its high-speed wireless 5G network for customers of its online streaming television service, DirecTv Now, in Austin, Texas. ","

454,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has imposed strict anti-collusion rules that ban discussions between rivals during an ongoing auction of airwaves. After the auction ends in April, the two parties are expected to begin negotiations, the sources told Reuters this week. Two and a half years ago, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. That deal would have put SoftBank in control of the merged company, with Deutsche Telekom becoming a minority shareholder. T-Mobile was worth around $30 billion at the time, but its market value has since risen to more than $50 billion as it overtook Sprint as the No. 3 wireless carrier by subscribers. Sprint’s market value is around $36 billion, roughly the same as in 2014. Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges has said in recent months that the German company is no longer willing to part with T-Mobile, prompting SoftBank to explore a new strategy towards a potential combination, the people said. Deutsche Telekom owns about 65 percent of T-Mobile. While SoftBank is still open to discussing other options, it is now willing to surrender control of Sprint and retain a minority stake in a merger with T-Mobile, the sources said. They asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. The Reuters report sent shares of T-Mobile surging as much as 7.9 percent before they eased back to close up 5.5 percent at $63.92. Shares of Sprint ended 3.3 percent higher at $9.30. Investors have said a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, ranked third and fourth respectively, would still face antitrust challenges, but made strategic sense as the industry moves to fifth-generation wireless technology. Carriers will need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade to 5G networks that promise to be 10 times to 100 times faster than current speeds. SoftBank, Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile all declined to comment. “We may buy, we may sell. Maybe a simple merger, we may be dealing with T-Mobile, we may be dealing with totally different people, different company,” SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told analysts on the company’s latest quarterly earnings call earlier this month. Dish declined to comment and Comcast did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under CEO John Legere, T-Mobile has rolled out unlimited data plans and international roaming packages. Combined with aggressive marketing, this has boosted T-Mobile customer base at the expense of its rivals. T-Mobile said it had 71.5 million total customers while Sprint had 59.5 million at the end of 2016. T-Mobile is now almost as big as Deutsche Telekom’s German business. “We are not in the mood of selling the business,” Hoettges told investors last November. While Sprint’s customer base has also grown under CEO Marcelo Claure and financials have improved, the growth was primarily driven by heavy price discounts. Despite new investment, the company’s network is still viewed by many consumers as weaker than its rivals. Reuters could not determine how much of a premium SoftBank may want Deutsche Telekom to pay for control of Sprint. Barclays analysts wrote in a note in December that a merger of T-Mobile and Sprint could result in $25 billion to $30 billion in synergies but said, “it is not imminently clear to us that the various regulatory agencies would reverse course having already blessed the outcome of a four-player market.” The FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice sent strong messages in 2014 that they did not want Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile to merge among themselves. Since then, AT&T acquired satellite television provider DirecTV and signed an agreement to buy media giant Time Warner Inc TWX.N, though that deal is still under regulatory review and has attracted criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Verizon has also been exploring other acquisitions. Antitrust experts said it was difficult to predict how the Trump administration would view a T-Mobile-Sprint merger since key antitrust appointments at the Justice Department have not been made. It is also not clear how such a combination would be viewed by the FCC, whose new chairman Ajit Pai is viewed as more business-friendly than his predecessor. “I am of the camp that that will not happen even in a Trump administration,” Christopher Marangi, co-chief investment officer at GAMCO Investors Inc, said on the prospects of a T-Mobile-Sprint combination. “That kind of merger means lots of job cuts in the U.S.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said price wars between Sprint and T-Mobile have driven down overall wireless prices for consumers. “Antitrust regulators could well argue that this is precisely the dynamic they would want to preserve,” Moffett added. Son has said he expects his company to benefit from Trump’s promised deregulation of the U.S. economy. After meeting Trump in early December, Son pledged to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. ","

455,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Frontier Communications Corp. (Frontier, NYSE: FTR) and its  subsidiaries to 'BB-' from 'BB'. The Rating Outlook remains Negative. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the first mortgage bonds at Frontier Southwest  Inc. and has revised the long-term issue ratings of Frontier and other  subsidiaries as listed at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade reflects lower than anticipated EBITDA due to weak revenue and  subscriber trends that, when coupled with low free cash flow (FCF) generation,  have resulted in a slower deleveraging path. Frontier will need additional time  to deleverage as it incorporates the Verizon assets into its operations and to  stabilize revenue and subscriber trends in its legacy and new markets. Fitch now  anticipates gross leverage of 4.3x at year-end 2018, versus 3.8x by year-end  2017. The expected range is more reflective of a 'BB-' rating. Frontier's Rating Outlook is Negative, as Frontier is not expected to reach  Fitch's leverage threshold of 4.2x-4.3x for the current rating until  approximately the end of 2018. Improved Scale, FCF Prospects   Frontier nearly doubled in size after acquiring Verizon Communications Inc.'s  wireline properties in California, Texas and Florida (the Verizon transaction)  in April 2016. Pro forma consolidated revenue increases to approximately $10  billion from $5.6 billion in 2015. Fitch believes Frontier's enhanced scale  should lead to improved FCF, defined as net cash provided by operating  activities less capex and dividends, over time. The acquisition is not expected  to require material additional capital spending given past network upgrades by  Verizon. Operational Challenges Pressure Revenue Challenges faced by Frontier at the close of the Verizon transaction resulted in  elevated subscriber churn and weaker than expected revenue. Frontier anticipated  slower subscriber gross additions as a result of the company's decision to  temporarily suspend marketing activities during the first half of 2016. However,  the company faced additional, unexpected headwinds during the second and third  quarters of 2016 after onshoring its call centers. Although the call center  issues appear to have subsided, Fitch believes it will take additional time for  marketing efforts to ramp up and stabilize subscriber gross addition trends. Subsidiary Debt Ratings The 'RR1' Recovery Rating assigned to the approximately $850 million of  outstanding subsidiary debt reflects its structural seniority to all of the  parent debt. Of this amount, $100 million is secured and the remainder  unsecured. The 'RR2' assigned to the secured revolver and secured term loans  reflects the potential limitations in value of Frontier North as the only source  of collateral security, including potential revolver drawings (per Fitch's  approach), if cash flows are stressed. In addition, Frontier North has $200  million of unsecured debt that is structurally senior to the equity pledge  providing security to the parent secured debt. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Frontier include: -- Consolidated revenues rising to just under $10 billion at the end of 2017,  reflecting a full year of revenue contribution from the Verizon wireline  properties. Fitch expects Frontier to slowly regain its footing during 2017  following weak revenue trends after the close of the Verizon transaction; -- Lower EBITDA from elevated customer churn largely offsets the $1 billion of  annualized cost synergies realized by Frontier in 2Q16, resulting in EBITDA  margins of 40% during 2017;  -- Capex around $1.3 billion in 2017. Fitch's assumption reflects capital  intensity of 12.5%, and includes additional capital spending for CAF II, and to  a lesser extent, integration;  -- Cash taxes are expected to be a refund of $100 million to $110 million in  2016, and minimal in 2017 as a result of the tax-basis step-up from the Verizon  transaction and bonus depreciation. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will use gross leverage versus net leverage going forward, comparable to  most Fitch-rated companies across the telecommunications sector. Fitch will take  into consideration any prefunding of maturing debt on a pro forma basis if  necessary. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action would likely coincide with: --Gross leverage sustained above 4.2x-4.3x as a result of weaker than expected  operating trends, shareholder-friendly activities or additional material  acquisitions; --While not expected, a return to mid-single-digit declines in revenue. Rating concerns would increase if Frontier's leverage (as defined by Fitch) is  not below 4.2x-4.3x by the end of 2018. A positive rating action would likely coincide with: --Gross leverage sustained below 3.7x-3.8x; --FCF margins sustained in the mid- to high-single digits. LIQUIDITY Manageable Maturities Upcoming principal repayments are manageable and amount to $509 million and $733  million during 2017 and 2018, respectively. Fitch expects Frontier to rely on  its revolver and the capital markets to refinance upcoming maturities until FCF  improves. Frontier has some capacity under its covenants to issue secured debt,  which could be a way for the company to refinance upcoming maturities and reduce  annual interest expense.  Improving Financial Flexibility Anticipated Financial flexibility is expected to strengthen in step with improvement in FCF.  Pressured EBITDA, heavy integration spending prior to the close of the Verizon  transaction, and sustained dividend payments resulted in a FCF deficit of $711  million at the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2016. However, Fitch expects FCF will  be positive, albeit minimal, in 2017 as the majority of integration costs have  subsided. Fitch also expects FCF margins will improve to the mid-single digits  over the forecast horizon. Frontier's liquidity position was adequate at the end  of Sept. 30, 2016, supported by $311 million of cash and full availability under  its $750 million  (RCF).  The $750 million senior secured RCF is in place until May 2018. Management  stated it is looking to renew and extend the revolver in the coming year. The  facility is available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund  dividend payments. The main financial covenant in Frontier's secured facilities  requires the maintenance of net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.5x or less. Net debt is  defined as total debt less cash exceeding $50 million. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the ratings and maintained the Negative Outlook as follows:  Frontier Communications Corp. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --$750 million senior secured revolving credit facility due 2018 to 'BB/RR2'  from 'BB+/RR2'; --$1.6 billion senior secured term loan due 2021 to 'BB/RR2' from 'BB+/RR2'; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures to 'BB-/RR4' from 'BB/RR4'.  Frontier North Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier West Virginia Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier California Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier Florida LLC --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debentures to 'BB/RR1' from 'BB+/RR1'. Frontier Southwest Inc. --IDR to 'BB-' from 'BB'. Fitch has affirmed the following long-term issue rating: Frontier Southwest Inc. --First mortgage bonds at 'BB+/RR1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

457,Donna Fuscaldo,2232017,Investopedia,2162017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs One of the knocks on T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) is that it doesn’t have the same network coverage as rival Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), but judging from what T-Mobile had to say when it reported fourth-quarter results, that gap is narrowing and could close even more this year. As part of T-Mobile’s earnings presentation, it showed two maps showing its current network coverage and where it expects to be by the end of the year. While there are a lot of areas—particularly in Montana, Wisconsin and West Virginia—that won't get T-Mobile 4G LTE coverage by the end of the year, the same map shows coverage pretty much all over the country. According to T-Mobile, 4G LTE coverage currently reaches 314 million people, which is up from zero just four years ago. T-Mobile is forecasting coverage of 320 million  by the end of the year.  The company said it plans on using new technology to improve connection speeds and has been re-farming existing older spectrum. “At the end of Q4 2016, approximately 70% of spectrum was being used for 4G LTE compared to 52% at the end of Q4 2015,” said T-Mobile. “The company expects to continue to re-farm spectrum currently committed to 2G and 3G technologies.” (See also: T-Mobile Posts Q4 Results That Beat Street Views.) For Verizon, a narrowing of the gap between network coverage can’t be welcome news. With T-Mobile rolling out aggressive plans and promotions, Verizon can no longer ignore the third-place carrier. That was evident earlier this week when Verizon caved and announced an unlimited data plan after avoiding them for several . years. Earlier this month, OpenSignal, a research firm that tracks coverage and performance of mobile operators around the world, said in its ""State of Mobile Networks: USA"" report that T-Mobile is narrowing the coverage gap against Verizon. OpenSignal, which drew upon 4.6 billion measurements, found Verizon’s LTE signal was available 88.2% of the time, placing it in the lead among the big four U.S. carriers. T-Mobile, however, is closing the gap, with its 4G availability less than 2 percentage points behind Verizon in the fourth quarter. OpenSignal also found T-Mobile and Verizon are neck and neck in terms of speed. Six months ago T-Mobile was in the lead, but thanks to upgrades of its 4G network Verizon was able to catch up. ​ ",T-Mobile 4G Network Coverage Gap Narrowing | Investopedia,0.91

(CHTR), the second-place cable TV operator, was able to post fourth-quarter results that easily surpassed Wall Street views. For the period ended Dec. 31, Charter reported net income of $454 million, or $1.67 a share, which compares to a loss of $122 million or $1.21 a share in the year-earlier fourth quarter. Analysts, according to FactSet had expected Charter to weigh in with earnings of $1.05 a share. Revenue of $10.28 billion was also higher than the analyst consensus for revenue of $10.23 billion. During the quarter, Charter said it added 345,000 customers, but it lost 51,000 on the video side. In its residential business, Charter said video revenue increased 1.9% while internet revenue increased 13.3% and revenue from its voice business declined 0.5% from last year’s fourth quarter. Charter recently acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Cable, which expands its footprint in the broadband and cable markets. (See also: Charter and TWC Receive FTC Merger Approval.) The decline in video subscribers comes at a time when countless consumers are cutting the cord on their set-top boxes, favoring streaming video content that doesn't require a costly device. There are fears in the marketplace cable companies are going to lose more customers to over-the-top streaming video services. “Since the close of our transactions in May, we have been managing the complicated process of integrating three different companies with over 26 million customers and 90 thousand employees. Despite the complexity, our integration is going well. We also continued to grow in 2016, with pro forma customer growth of nearly 5%, revenue growth of 7%, and double digit adjusted EBITDA growth,” said Tom Rutledge, chairman and CEO of Charter, in a press release announcing fourth-quarter results. “In 2017, we remain focused on applying our growth oriented operating strategy across our new footprints, driving more customer satisfaction, growth, and shareholder value.” During the quarter, speculation has abounded that Charter could be a takeout target for one of the telecom players looking to expand more into video. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is seen as the most likely suitor with Chief Executive Lowell McAdam expressing interest in a deal. While Charter's Rutledge has brushed off calls for Charter to buy a content company, he didn’t dismiss the idea of a deal with another cable company.

""FANG"" is a name popularized by CNBC's Jim Cramer for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet as the stocks started to outperform the market by a large magnitude in 2013. They trailed the S&P 500 last year however. ""We are recommending investors overweight FANG in 2017, reversing our 'avoid call' made in late-2015,"" wrote Lee, head of research, in a note. ""FANG is essentially the 'Blue chip' of internet/cloud names."" Lee was one of the few Wall Street strategists who predicted the market would rally on a Donald Trump election win. After he was correctly one of the most bullish strategists on Wall Street last year, he turned heads in January by becoming the most bearish, slapping a price target of 2,275 on the S&P 500, below where it is now. The strategist believes FANG stocks' high market values versus the number of employees makes them particularly attractive to investors looking for companies that can better deal with rising wage inflation.

When it comes to telecom stocks, this is the ultimate battle. In AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), we have a combined market share of over 65% of America's wireless phone subscribers and two battle-tested dividend payers. But which is the better stock to buy today, especially for retirees looking for safe and reliable income? We can't answer that question with 100% certainty, but we can approach the question from three different angles in an attempt to get an idea for what we're most comfortable with. Image source: Getty Images. This is, in my humble opinion, the most important thing for any beginning investor to understand. A company's sustainable competitive advantage -- often referred to as its ""moat"" -- is the most important thing to understand. In its simplest form, a moat is what keeps customers coming back year after year and keeps competitors at bay for decades. But because this competition pits the American wireless duopoly against itself, that's no longer a differentiator. Nor is market share a key differentiator. According to Statista, Verizon owns 34.9% of the market, while AT&T clocks in with 32.4%. Verizon's decision to buyout Vodafone's share of Verizon Wireless helped to solidify this position. And it's important to note that both of these players are transitioning from being traditional telecoms to owning content and content platforms. AT&T has merged or announced mergers with both Time Warner and DIRECTV. Verizon has done the same with AOL, among others. These are major moves that will help put a moat around both companies, but, again, they don't really help us differentiate the two. Telecom investors can't be blamed for wanting cash to be returned to them in the form of dividends. But there are limits to paying out dividends. Tough economic times hit, and when they do, it's important to have cash on hand. Given the debt-heavy nature of telecoms, this is especially important. Here's how AT&T and Verizon stack up in terms of financial fortitude. And remember, AT&T is valued at roughly 25% larger than Verizon. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow AT&T $5.8 billion $114 billion $13.0 billion $16.9 billion Verizon $3.5 billion $105 billion $13.6 billion $5.7 billion Data source: Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Cash includes cash, short-, and long-term investments. There are a few caveats here. Obviously, both have huge debt loads versus not too much cash. That's pretty common with telecoms. And the acquisitions of Yahoo!, AOL, Verizon Wireless, DIRECTV, and Time Warner all help add to the debt levels of the duo. But when it comes to cash flow, there's a clear winner: AT&T. Verizon just reported a pretty brutal quarter that saw free cash flow come in at negative $600 million. While I don't expect Verizon to allow this trend to continue for long, it allows us to declare a clear winner for now. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout AT&T 15 15 1.7 4.7% 66% Verizon 13 36 3.2 4.7% 161% Data source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Here again, we have a clear winner. Verizon's low free cash flow once again rears its ugly head into the equation. Over the past 12 months, the company has paid out more in dividends than it has been able to keep in its pockets. AT&T, on the other hand, has a very healthy dividend right now. Those 4.7% yields, while equivalent on paper, are of very different sustainability levels. So there you have it. AT&T is the clear winner. While I have no doubt that Verizon's numbers will eventually improve, AT&T cash flow and dividend payment are in a much healthier place right now -- and its stock seems to be offering a fair value given all of the information we have. Retirees looking for solid dividend stocks would do themselves a favor to investigate AT&T even further. ","
      
    Better Buy: AT&T Inc. vs. Verizon Communications Inc. -- The Motley Fool

In the not too distant future, 5G networks will bring faster speeds, less latency, and more coverage to wireless consumers across the United States. 5G is shorthand for the fifth generation of mobile networks. It will be the next wireless standard implemented beyond the current 4G protocol most American wireless consumers enjoy today. The benefits will be immense and immediately recognizable. Data rates for 5G are expected to be 10 times faster than 4G and LTE systems, with download speeds as fast as 10Gbps (gigabits per second). 5G will connect the internet of things at speeds 10 times faster than 4G. Image source: Verizon Communications Inc. For a little perspective of how significant this upgrade is, consider this example provided by Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS) CEO Liam Griffin: With the 3G system, it took one day to download a full-length HD movie. This same file on a 4G network could be downloaded in minutes. On a 5G network, it would be a matter of seconds before the same movie was downloaded. Of course, a great deal of work remains to be completed before this new technology becomes reality, but much progress has already been made. Last July, the FCC passed a series of rules that laid the foundation for the advancement of 5G in the United States. These rules gave the telecom networks and tech giants the framework needed to experiment with the available spectrum to see what works best. Since the nationwide 5G network is a coming reality, investors would do well to consider which companies might stand to benefit the most in this massive shift in mobile networks. Here are three companies that are leaders in their respective markets and that are especially optimistic about their opportunities as 5G implementation moves closer. Collectively, they cover a wide variety of sectors and industries, and some might be more obvious than others. But together, this telecom giant, semiconductor manufacturer, and specialty glass maker might represent some of the best investments in the race to 5G. Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) is committed to being the first telecommunication company to deploy a 5G network. In the company's 2016 second-quarter conference call, CEO Lowell McAdams stated he learned from Verizon's experience with 4G LTE that ""being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities."" Image source: Verizon Communications Inc. Beyond the obvious benefits of being the first to upgrade its network, 5G would also substantially lower Verizon's Fios costs. Fios by Verizon is the company's effort to bring the advantages of fiber optics straight to the end consumer. In the same conference call, McAdams stated: I think of 5G initially as, in effect, Wireless fiber, which is Wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With Wireless fiber, the so called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure. With the premium pricing inherent to being the first to deploy a 5G network coupled with serious cost-saving benefits, the real question becomes whether Verizon will actually be the first to deploy a 5G network. On that front, CFO Matthew Ellis had encouraging news for investors during the company's most recently reported conference call: 5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 precommercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases, including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods. Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G products for a commercial launch. Skyworks Solutions manufactures analog semiconductor products that enable smartphones, IOT devices, wearables, smart home devices, and a host of other products to connect to Wi-Fi or wireless networks. While mostly known as an iPhone supplier, the company is beginning to grow beyond Apple. CEO Liam Griffin is certainly excited about the company's prospects for growth related to 5G. In Skyworks' 2017 first-quarter conference call, Griffin stated the company's expertise, scale, and customer relationships were positioning Skyworks for ""5G leadership."" Later, Griffin added, ""5G represents a massive growth opportunity for our industry and certainly for Skyworks."" Why the sudden optimism? Precise filtering is increasingly important in wireless communications. Among the feathers in Skyworks' cap is they are one of the largest manufacturers of TC-SAW filters, which stands for temperature-compensated-surface acoustic wave filters. This is a quality, low-cost alternative to the more expensive BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filters, which some of Skyworks' competitors make. Traditionally, SAW filters work well on lower frequencies, but not higher ones. However, certain technical design choices (TDD v. FDD, if you're a networking geek) in the evolving 5G standard might open the door for Skyworks' cheaper filters to work at higher frequencies as well. This positions Skyworks to capture more market share in 5G-capable connected devices than previously would have been possible. Upon the news that Skyworks Solutions could play a larger part in 5G devices, shares spiked and are up more than 18% year to date. SWKS data by YCharts. It has been almost 50 years since Corning Inc (NYSE:GLW) invented the first low-loss optical fiber that could transmit data as light. Since that historic day in 1970, optical fiber has become the backbone of network infrastructure. While Corning is probably best known for outfitting LCD televisions with glass screens, its second-largest division is still manufacturing optical fiber. In Corning's most recently reported quarter, earnings from its optical communications segment were up a dazzling 85% year over year. The higher profitability was driven by improved manufacturing costs and the selling of their ""solution products"" in this area. Image source: Getty Images. In the conference call, CFO Tony Tripeny said the company expected strong growth in this division to continue, projecting for ""at least 25%"" growth in the current quarter. Tripeny also stated Corning was prepared to ""leverage the strong growth opportunities"" it sees in the telecom market as the industry leaders looked to invest in ""next generations and network capabilities"". It is no coincidence that Corning's stock price has skyrocketed the past year as this division has grown. A year ago, Corning's shares traded for about $18. Currently, shares are trading around $26.75, highs the stock price hasn't seen since before the Great Recession. ","
      
    3 Top 5G Stocks to Buy and Hold -- The Motley Fool

464,Todd Campbell,2232017,Fool,2162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett loves buying great stocks at fair prices, but he doesn't hold onto every stock he buys forever. Sometimes, he'll sell stocks after he's made a healthy profit. Other times, he'll sell because something has changed to make the company less attractive to him. Knowing what stocks Buffett's selling can be important because his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) (NYSE:BRK-A), is so big that when he sells, it can cause share prices to drop. That's a risk investors might not want to take! Luckily, Berkshire Hathaway files a 13F report with the SEC every quarter that shows exactly what he's been selling, and that can keep you from being unhappily surprised. For example, Buffett sold shares in Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in Q4. Should you sell those stocks too? Warren Buffett has been a longtime owner of Wal-Mart Stores, but he's been selling shares in the retail giant since last spring, and in Q4, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its position in Wal-Mart by 89% to 1.4 million shares. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. One reason Buffett may be selling Wal-Mart is because the company has been under fire from online retailers, and maintaining market share against those retailers has been hard. Wal-Mart is nowhere near as troubled as some other traditional retailers, but retail sales figures, and Wal-Mart's own financials suggest Wal-Mart's best days may be behind it. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce industry revenue jumped 15.7% year over year in Q3, 2016, and it now represents 8.4% of total retail sales. Wal-Mart's most recent quarterly earnings report from November shows investors just how tough its been to compete against online retailers like Amazon.com. In Wal-Mart's fiscal third quarter, its sales grew by an anemic 0.7% to $118.2 billion, and through the first nine months of fiscal 2017, its sales also grew by just 0.7% to $355 billion. For perspective, consider that Amazon.com's net sales surged 27% to $136.0 billion in 2016. Based on that comparison alone, it's understandable why Buffett no longer wants Wal-Mart to be one of his biggest holdings. Warren Buffett was betting that Deere & Co. could recapture some of luster last year, and it seems the farm machinery maker lived up to his expectations. Deere & Co.'s shares came into 2016 trading in the $70's. But, after a big run up, they finished the year trading at over $100. With Deere's shares rallying to all-time highs, it appears Buffett decided not to push his luck. In the third quarter, he sold 874,185 shares, and in the fourth quarter, he sold his remaining 21.1 million shares. It's anyone's guess if Warren Buffett will buy shares in Deere & Co. again, but if he does, it's probably not going to be for a while, unless of course, Deere's shares sell-off, or farm income climbs. In 2016, farm income was the lowest since the recession, and that caused Deere's net revenue to fall 8% to $26.6 billion. Deere & Co.'s ability to turn a profit despite slowing equipment demand is impressive, but the outlook for 2017 doesn't provide a lot of conviction to buy Deere's shares at lofty levels. The USDA net farm income forecast for this year puts it at the lowest levels since 2002, and Deere is projecting that equipment sales will dip by another 1% in 2017. Thus, Deere & Co. may be worth buying only if share prices retreat  Until then, patience is probably best. Verizon may be the country's biggest wireless carrier, but that fact alone wasn't enough to keep Warren Buffett a shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway sold almost all of its stake in Verizon last quarter. We may never know exactly why Buffett soured on Verizon, but since Buffett has owned Verizon shares since the middle of 2014, it's possible, depending on the exact timing of his buys and sells, that he was able to book a double-digit percentage profit on his investment in Verizon, and if so, then that gain might have been enough to convince him to sell into growing industry uncertainty. Last year, Verizon decided to buy Yahoo! to merge it with its AOL business, but after a high-profile data breach, pressure has mounted for that deal to be renegotiated to reflect damage to Yahoo!'s brand. Rumors are that Yahoo! may agree to a $250 million haircut to appease Verizon, but even at that lower price, it's not a given that this deal will be a big win. Adding to Verizon's uncertainty is the fact that it might need to do more deals just to keep pace with AT&T. AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015, and this week, Time Warner shareholders approved AT&T's $85 billion acquisition offer. As competitors push deeper into video, Verizon could have to make its own big splash, and that could be costly. Depending on how costly, that could be enough to send investors to the sidelines.

    Top Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling Now -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9977
465,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",2232017,Fool,2162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. According to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) latest SEC filing, Warren Buffett and company had an active fourth quarter in 2016. After sitting on a company record $85 billion cash hoard at the end of the third quarter, and having said that Berkshire spent $12 billion on common stocks in the wake of Donald Trump's election victory, investors have been wondering what Berkshire has been up to. Here's the answer. While we don't necessarily know the reasoning behind Berkshire's latest investments, or whether they were initiated by Warren Buffett himself or one of his trusted stock pickers, we do know what changed in Berkshire's portfolio during the fourth quarter. Here are the most notable buys: Image Source: Getty Images. 1. Apple -- Berkshire already owned Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), although the company's $2 billion stake wasn't a large amount by Berkshire's standards. During the fourth quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake nearly quadrupled to about 57 million shares, which represent more than 1% of all the outstanding Apple stock. It's interesting to note that Buffett's stock-pickers were the ones who initiated the Apple investment, but given the size of the increase, the latest Apple addition could have come from Buffett himself. This investment did not surprise me at all. I've written before how Apple still represented a compelling bargain at the price levels it was trading for during the fourth quarter, and that Berkshire should take advantage. Well, apparently, management agreed. 2. Airlines -- Berkshire surprised many investors when it revealed its third-quarter 2016 investments in several airline stocks. After all, Buffett has spoken out against airline stocks as investments several times in his career, During the third quarter, Berkshire invested in American Airlines, Delta, and United Continental, and increased its stake in all three during the fourth quarter. At the same time the initial airline stakes were revealed, Buffett also said he made an investment in Southwest Airlines. He didn't specify the amount at the time, but we now know it's a stake worth more than $2 billion. 3. Monsanto -- Berkshire revealed a new stake in Monsanto, of about 8 million shares valued at about $872 million. Monsanto currently trades for about $109 per share, and the company plans to sell itself to Bayer for $128 per share. If the deal goes through, Buffett stands to make a quick profit, but the market doesn't seem convinced at this point. 4. Sirius XM -- The final major change was the addition of a nearly 167 million-share position in satellite radio operator Sirius XM. Granted, because of the company's $4.80 share price as of this writing, this stake translates into a relatively small (for Berkshire) $800 million investment. 1. Wal-Mart -- Buffett has been gradually trimming his Wal-Mart stake for some time, but he sold a substantial number of his remaining shares. Berkshire's investment in the retail giant has been cut from about 13 million shares to 1.4 million. As I've mentioned, we don't know the reasoning, but my guess is that the success of online retailers like Amazon has changed the competitive landscape in a way Buffett doesn't like. 2. Verizon -- Berkshire sold nearly all of its 15 million shares of Verizon during the quarter. Since Berkshire also unloaded its AT&T stake earlier in 2016, this didn't come as a huge surprise. 3. Kinder Morgan -- Buffett bought about 20 million shares of Kinder Morgan in early 2016, and sold his entire position during the fourth quarter. Kinder Morgan has nearly doubled from its early 2016 lows, so this could be a matter of the valuation simply not looking attractive to Buffett anymore. 4. Deere -- Just like Kinder Morgan, Deere has rallied sharply, up by about 43% over the past year alone. So, while we don't know for sure, this sale could potentially be due to a valuation issue as well. You shouldn't necessarily follow Buffett's moves. For one thing, by the time we hear about what Buffett is doing, it can be a completely different market. Since the fourth quarter ended, the S&P has risen by more than 4%, and some of the stocks Buffett has bought have risen even higher than that. Apple, for example, has risen by nearly 17% since the end of 2016, and Apple was trading even cheaper for much of the quarter. While I don't necessarily think Apple is too expensive to buy right now, it's fair to say that Buffett and company likely got a far better deal on their Apple shares than investors could get now. ^SPX data by YCharts ","
      
    Here's What Warren Buffett Is Buying and Selling -- Should You Join Him? -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9982
466,Motley Fool Staff,2232017,Fool,2162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The team goes on to discuss the latest disappointment from watchmaker Fossil (NASDAQ:FOSL) and upbeat reports from e-commerce player Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and beverage company SodaStream (NASDAQ:SODA). A full transcript follows the video. They also unloaded their stake in Deere and Verizon, and Kinder Morgan was another that we follow at the Fool. So, interesting to see Berkshire dumping Kinder Morgan after less than a year of holding it -- Kinder Morgan is an infrastructure company, a natural gas and oil pipeline -- then, to be loading up on airlines, which tend to benefit from lower energy prices. So, maybe they're seeing something or expecting something with energy prices to remain low, which would benefit airlines and could hurt some energy infrastructure companies like Kinder Morgan.  Greer: So, if I am an investor and I'm considering some of these stocks, to what extent should I try to mimic what Buffett and Berkshire are doing? Because obviously, he's had an incredible track record. Should I mimic some of these moves? Or is he playing a different game?  Kretzmann: I don't think you ever want to blindly follow any investor. I think what you want to mimic is the process and the strategy. Obviously, we do that at the Fool with David and Tom Gardner, they're great investors here. Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett. If you're just blindly following any investor, you're not really going to learn a whole lot as an investor. You really want to understand the thought process that goes behind those decisions. I think that's what's key to be a successful investor.  Moser: Yeah, I think a very good example of that -- because I think David is spot on there -- if we look at a business like Markel, which we talk about often here, and we refer to it as a baby Berkshire in many ways, because the business is set up very much in the same way. It's an insurance business that owns a portfolio of stocks, and now holding businesses as well. Tom Gayner, the co-CEO, generally, he's known for the investing success there at the company. If you look at the holdings in Markel's portfolio, they own Apple. They also own Amazon. They don't own Wal-Mart. They own Facebook. So, there's a business where they do a lot of things that Berkshire does as well, but even they aren't mimicking those moves, despite the fact that Gayner and company are professed Berkshire fans, they have a wonderful brunch they're out there the day after the Berkshire Hathaway meeting. There's a lot of similarities in the business there. It's very small comparatively speaking, but you can see there as an example in Markel's portfolio. Sure, they follow some of Buffett's leads there, but they also do their own thinking and come to their own conclusions. We encourage investors out there to do the same.  Greer: Guys, let's talk Shopify. Shares of the e-commerce platform up big on Wednesday after the company reported better than expected earnings. David, I think for a lot of investors, Shopify is not exactly a household name. The stock has really been on a tear, though.  Kretzmann: Yeah, Shopify is a company that's in the background, but you've probably interacted with its platform in some shape or form. The company serves almost 400,000 merchants, mainly small and mid-size businesses. So, if you're a small business looking to get online and have an online shopping cart, Shopify is one of the platforms to go to if you're looking to set up a shopping cart, set up that online platform to offer goods and services online. A lot of smaller businesses are among Shopify's customer base. This was a great quarter. The company is having no problem growing quickly right now. Sales were up 86%, they added 50,000 merchants, bringing that total to 375,000 merchants under their umbrella. That's up more than 50% from where they were at the end of 2015. So, a lot of growth here. And the market opportunity here is still pretty big, and I think that's why, even though the stock is trading at a premium valuation, this level of growth theoretically could continue for a while. If you look at the key geographies where Shopify operates today, there are about 10 million merchants with less than 500 employees in those markets. That's really the key demographic that Shopify is going after. And every time, the average revenue per merchant on Shopify's platform is above $1,200 now. That would suggest a market size of about $10 billion. So, still a lot of room to run here, but the stock is still pricey.  Moser: Yeah. We've looked at Shopify for MDP, it's obviously a recommendation in a number of our services here. A very fascinating business from a number of different perspectives. There are a couple of things, questions I still need answers to here. No. 1 is just from the profitability perspective. They are growing, still not profitable, not cash flow positive. I wonder when is all of that going to change? Because I think if it does change, when it does change, it could be a tremendous catalyst, but I also wonder how much the market is pricing into there today. But the other question I have is just in regard to third-party relationships. With everything that Shopify does well, there is a provider that's helping them along the way. And I'll use payments as an example. They contract with Stripe, I believe, as a provider on the payment side. At some point, Stripe is going to look to become profitable, and they're going to try to exercise a little pricing power, which, in turn, is going to flow through Shopify's financials, unless they figure out a way to diversify from that provider as well. So, I just wonder, from the perspective of those third-party providers, how that plays out on this business down the road, and its profitability.  Greer: And along those lines, they've also got one of those frenemy dynamics with Amazon. They compete with Amazon, but they're obviously a partner of Amazon's. So, David, when you think about that frenemy dynamic, as a potential investor in Shopify, how much should that concern you?  Kretzmann: I think it's something to be aware of. I think some people gave Shopify a little bit more credit than it deserves for the transition Amazon made from its web store business. In 2010, Amazon launched a similar business to what Shopify has done. It was a few years after Shopify had started, and Amazon essentially said, ""We have a lot of third-party sellers on Amazon and we want to build a web store for those sellers to have their own independent website,"" which is essentially what Shopify did. Amazon shut that down in 2016 and basically made it easy for those Amazon webstore sellers to transition or migrate to Shopify's platform. So, Shopify called itself the preferred migration partner. But what a lot of people don't say is that there were only about 1,000 merchants on Amazon's platform last year. So, it's a win for Shopify, but it's not a huge catalyst, I don't think. You want to be aware of all those dynamics. To a similar point, it's not just with Amazon, it's also with those third-party merchants, the payments providers, the shipping solutions, because you have a lot of different companies providing those services. You have other online marketplaces like Etsy, which are branching more and more into Shopify's territory. So, I can see why people are excited about the business, because on the surface, this is a potentially very attractive business, because it's recurring revenue, it's a subscription fee, Shopify is bringing in monthly subscription revenue. If they can retain those enterprises over time, that could be very profitable. But up to this point, the company's losses are expanding, still burning cash. It's a riskier stock, still.  Greer: OK, guys, shares of Fossil down big on Wednesday. When I think Fossil ... OK, I don't really think Fossil. But if I were to think Fossil, I think watches.  Moser: You didn't get your wife something from Fossil for Valentine's Day, Mac?  Greer: What's the story here with Fossil, Jason?  Moser: Listen, leather accessories and watches and tchotchke, if that doesn't scream huge market opportunity, Mac, I don't know what does. This is a business that has been in a lot of trouble here for a while. This is nothing new. I was looking at this back in May of 2016 because of some revised guidance to the downside that really took its toll on the stock. I think we're seeing more of the same here. The bottom line is, retail is tough, but when you're in fashion retail and tchotchke fashion retail, I think it's even more difficult. There's certainly no real pricing power in that market. And Fossil is not known for that aspirational brand that people will pay up for. So, I respect the fact that management is attempting to diversify the revenue streams somewhat. They made an acquisition a little while back to get some exposure to the connected fitness realm. I don't know that I necessarily look at that as the biggest opportunity, either. I mean, it was Misfit, I believe, is the name of the company they acquired. If you look in the release they just put out this morning, they say, ""We'll double our efforts and wearables by launching over 300 SKUs, introducing new brands to the platform and enhancing engineering to enable additional functionality and more stylish and slimmer cases.""   Greer: You sound skeptical.   Moser: Well, I think there's reason to be skeptical. We've seen what happened with Fitbit. We've seen a less than stellar response to other smartwatch products. I think it's fair to question this strategy. And I don't know that it's necessarily the solution for this company. If you look at the top line, it's going in the wrong direction. Margins, going in the wrong direction. This is not something that just happened overnight. It's been happening over the past seven years. I think investors would be very wise to avoid this one.  Greer: And you're not wearing a watch. David ...  Moser: I am wearing a watch. Not a smartwatch, though.  Greer: Oh, you are wearing a watch, sorry.  Moser: This is a gift from my lovely wife when I turned 40.  Greer: You're old school, though. People aren't wearing watches as much, right?  Moser: Maybe not, yeah. I think that's the challenge. You either have your watch aficionados, people who like watches, who probably aren't really going to want to wear something like that, and you have people who don't wear watches at all and you have to convince them to put something on their wrist and they're probably not going to, a la Mac Greer. Or, you have people who are looking for, maybe, a dedicated fitness device, and I think there are more compelling options out there. So, these guys are fighting an uphill battle.  Kretzmann: Apple Watch can get a bad rap, but since it came onto the scene a couple years ago, it still captures over 50% market share in the smartwatch category. And I think the Apple Watch Series 2 is really the crown jewel as far as smartwatches go. Anecdotally, it's interesting seeing Fitbit, Under Armour, and Fossil all getting crushed this quarter. Obviously, they're all in connected fitness in a different way. But, yeah, I was out at CES early January and Fossil was one of the many connected fitness wearable device companies out there. And that's just a category that's getting very crowded, and it's hard to distinguish what's different between what Fitbit, Under Armour, or Fossil are doing.  Moser: And I'll tell you, just from my experience in the golf business years ago, because part of what I did as a golf professional was run the golf shops, that's a retail business and you have to basically stock it with the stuff that people want. And there was a dynamic to it for this type of stuff. It was Brighton, most of the demand there on the club side was for Brighton keychains, watches, purses, things like that. There just is no pricing in this. I mean, inevitably, it all stayed on the shelves until Christmas time when we put everything on sale. So, it's just a really difficult market, and it's not terribly shocking to see Fossil having a tough time.  Kretzmann: I wouldn't rush to see it as a buying opportunity, either. The company is still producing a good amount of free cash flow. So, on the surface, you might be inclined to see this. Maybe it'll bounce back at some point. But revenue has dropped each year since 2014, and expenses have continued to go up, so you've seen margins get crushed. What really highlights it is, the earnings per share was $7.10 in 2014, and for 2017, management is guiding for earnings per share of ($0.50) to $0.20.   Greer: [whistles] That's quite a range.  Kretzmann: Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better, if ever.  Greer: Guys, let's conclude here with SodaStream. This is a stock that has been incredibly volatile over the last couple years. And we have some good news, and the stock up big on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Jason, forget soda, it seems like the story here is sparkling water.  Moser: Well, I liked our conversation earlier this morning: maybe this company, really, it all just boils down to the wrong name, right?  Greer: Terrible name.  Moser: We're sitting here ragging on soda, it seems like, quarter in and quarter out. Maybe it needs to be something like SeltzerStream or whatever. But, I think the real beauty to this business, in the beginning, it's one that we've covered here in the Foolish universe for a while ...  Greer: And what do they do, for people who don't know the company?  Moser: SodaStream basically sells you these machines so that you can make seltzer or soda at home. You can carbonate your own water and make your own sodas at home. And on the surface, it sounds like a pretty neat idea, you don't have to go lugging around 12 packs of Diet Coke anymore, you can just do it all right there at home.  Greer: I hate that idea. I'm sorry, I don't find that appealing at all on the surface.  Moser: [laughs] What, having the machine there?  Greer: Yeah! I don't drink soda, but I wouldn't want to make my own soda if I drank soda. That's like making your own toothpaste. Why? Why?  Moser: I don't disagree.  Greer: So, no, not on the surface, take it back. [laughs]   Moser: Being a Diet Coke guy, SodaStream, as a product, never attracted me from the beginning. Now, I will also say I made a big shift in trying to drink more seltzer. But even as that has occurred, I still have zero interest in having one of these SodaStreams on my counter at home because of the fact that you have to keep on replacing that CO2 cartridge. It's just constant maintenance. And that's the crux of the question here. The beauty of the model has always been the razorblade nature -- the razor being the machine and the blades being the consumables that you use for the machine, the CO2 cartridges, the flavors that you use for whatever you're wanting to drink. And for a long time, it seemed like maybe this had promise. Certainly has gained a lot of traction overseas. U.S., I think, the U.S. market was viewed as a potential opportunity and that never really played out so much, and the stock got pummeled over the past few years because of that. Interesting to see, they're making a little bit of a comeback here. If you look at the numbers, there was about 22.4% unit growth for the quarter, which translated into 37% growth in revenue for those machines. So, they're actually selling machines, and they're getting some decent pricing on them. The growth in the consumables, which is the higher-margin, was less impressive, up 5%. This kind of gets back to the initial question that we always had with these things -- it's one thing to give this thing as a gift to someone, where it's like, ""Oh, that's a neat machine,"" or whatever. But ultimately, at some point, does it not just end up collecting dust on your kitchen counter? And I think that's the hurdle that they still have to clear. This was a decent quarter, I'm not sure it necessarily indicates that they have cleared this hurdle and everything is better again.  Greer: David, looking at the stock chart for the last few years, it's gone from $40 up to around $70 all the way down to $13, and now it's back around $50.  Kretzmann: Yeah, across $50s. I think SodaStream, it's a great time to take a step back and see a lesson there, that you don't want to cut the future winner too early. SodaStream, I think the verdict is still out whether or not it is a winner, but I would much rather hold a loser too long than sell a winner too early. In Rule Breakers, we sold SodaStream right around $13 a year or two ago. Since then, the stock has come roaring back almost four times over the past year. So, I think there is something to be said for the strategy of just buying and forgetting. Even if you have a loser, if it's a small percentage of your portfolio, there is something to be said for just letting that ride. ","

                                   unveiled the terms of their expected new deal, the result of some lengthy negotiations after the discovery of two massive security breaches at Yahoo that affected more than a billion users. The revised terms slashed $350 million from the $4.8 billion purchase price Verizon agreed to pay, and included a clause about legal bills that will push some of the burden of shareholder litigation and a regulatory inquiry onto Yahoo. Specifically, Verizon and Yahoo agreed to share equally each any liabilities resulting from non-SEC related investigations and other third-party litigation associated with the data breach. There are currently 23 consumer class-action lawsuits filed against Yahoo for the breach, according to an SEC filing. But Yahoo will bear the sole responsibility of liabilities associated with the continuing SEC investigation and any shareholder lawsuits. The SEC is investigating whether the two huge data breaches should have been reported sooner to investors. At least one shareholder lawsuit was filed against Yahoo soon after the SEC investigation was announced and is seeking class action status in federal court. That suit alleges that Yahoo and its top executives, Chief Executive Officesr Marissa Mayer and CFO Ken Goldman, made public misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts to investors about the data breaches at the company. See also: Have a Yahoo email account? Here are three things to do after hacks Yahoo, though, may not exist in its current form when the results of all these legal actions are known. Verizon and Yahoo still say that they expect the deal to close in the second quarter; once it does, “Yahoo” will become part of Verizon while everything else that is part of Yahoo Inc. becomes part of a new holding company called Altaba. That means Altaba could be left holding the bag for some legal expenses stemming from the Yahoo hacks, possibly taking a chunk out of the $7 billion in cash and securities that Yahoo held at the end of 2016. For investors who have spent years waiting for Yahoo to figure out a way to spin out its cash and stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

But despite the rally, many investors are nervous. After all, markets front-loaded gains for 2017 in November and December, and it’s now up to President Trump and a Republican Congress to follow through on a business-friendly agenda that investors have already priced in to shares. Furthermore, while markets hung tough during Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s latest visit to Capitol Hill, we saw a tremendous spike of about 20% in the CBOE Volatility Index

                                   over just a few days. That’s a clear sign many traders are feeling uncertain about what the future holds in regards to interest rates and how that may impact the stock market. And let’s not forget that all this optimism in recent weeks may not materialize in the form of real economic growth. Recently, the World Bank warned that economic expansion in the developed world is painfully small, with just a 1.8% a growth rate expected this year. If you’re feeling a bit worried about the state of the stock-market rally, you have good reason. But as the last few years have shown, those who hide out in cash can miss out big by misinterpreting the signs. So what’s an investor to do if he or she wants to limit risk in this uncertain environment, but not bail out on the markets altogether? Simple: hide out in low-risk dividend stocks that offer stability and a steady stream of income that can offset any volatility and provide gains even if the stock market runs out of gas. Here are three such low-risk dividend payers I like right now: Realty Income With dividends paid since 1969, Realty Income Corp.

                                   should be on every income investor’s radar. But equally compelling is the fact that dividends are paid on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis — providing much more regular paydays than your typical dividend payer. And with a yield of about 4.2% currently, it’s not chump change. The reason Realty Income can offer such nice payouts is because it generates reliable cash flow from 4,600 properties. These sites are occupied by a wide number of industries that include bulletproof tenants such as Walgreens drugstores, AMC movie theaters and FedEx shipping facilities, just to name a few. With stable long-term leases and high-quality clients, those monthly payout will keep rolling in. And with an amazing track record that spans 76 consecutive quarters of ever-higher payouts, you can be expect this dividend growth name to increase its cash dividend across 2017 as well. If you’re worried about the possibility of a strong dollar dragging down multinationals in 2017, the domestic focus of Realty Income is a great hedge. Furthermore, the long-term leases of Realty Income will provide insulation from short-term market volatility. And heck, if it just so happens that we see a big stimulus that kick-starts retailers, you can indirectly participate in the upside. AT&T Yes, even boring old AT&T Inc.

                                   the important thing to remember is that this stock is an income powerhouse that won’t quit regardless of what happens with its content plans. Sure, AT&T would love to bolster streaming content offerings and have a stake in properties like CNN and HBO that are owned by Time Warner. But look elsewhere and you’ll see this isn’t the only bet AT&T is making, as it has forged ahead with a faster 5G network that supports the public’s reliance on mobile browsing.

recently issued weak guidance amid anemic wireless growth in January, AT&T earnings showed improved its “churn” rate and is making headway. And let’s not forget that it continues to evolve and integrate its DirecTV business, purchased back in 2014. Even without a content arm like Time Warner, it still has a stranglehold on distribution. Bears will note that AT&T didn’t exactly blow the doors off its fourth-quarter earnings report, with revenue down by a tiny amount year-over-year. But this is not a growth stock where double-digit revenue expansion is necessary. Instead, investors should focus on operating cash flow and free cash flow where the dividend payments come from — and both were very strong. Specifically, cash from operations was $10.1 billion, and free cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 19.2%. AT&T yields an impressive 4.8% as of this writing and pays out just 65% of earnings per share. That all but ensures a reliable dividend — and, more than likely, future increases in that payout. At a forward P/E of less than 14, this entrenched telecom is a very safe bet here. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners In any economic environment, dividend investors should be looking for stable investments with reliable cash flow. And if you really want a bit more security, you should also look for “wide moat” companies that have deep pockets to sustain themselves as well as major barriers to entry in their particular market.

The risks aren’t zero for this stock, to be honest, since it is so globally connected and there are a lot of local issues that can affect operations — everything from damage caused by a hurricane to local trade disputes. However, the diversification across sectors and around the globe helps mitigate those risks. There are many pieces in the global economic puzzle, but key infrastructure like roads and rails and power grids are some of the most important parts — in both good times and in bad. That means Brookfield Infrastructure is one of the safest bets out there for 2017. With the potential for a sentiment bounce if and when we ever see an infrastructure bill passed by Congress, Brookfield Infrastucture looks very secure for the rest of 2017.

The company said some of the latest intrusions can be connected to the “same state-sponsored actor believed to be responsible for the 2014 breach”, in which at least 500 million accounts were affected. “Based on the investigation, we believe an unauthorized third party accessed the company’s proprietary code to learn how to forge certain cookies,” Yahoo said in its latest annual filing. These cookies have been invalidated so they cannot be used to access user accounts, the company said. Forged cookies allow an intruder to access a user’s account without a password. Yahoo also said in December that data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest breach in history. The company said on Wednesday that it would not award Chief Executive Marissa Mayer a cash bonus for 2016, following the independent committee’s findings related to the 2014 security incident. Mayer has also offered to forgo any 2017 annual equity award as the breaches occurred during her tenure, Yahoo said. ","

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman appointed by President Donald Trump, believes all companies in the “online space should be subject to the same rules, and the federal government should not favor one set of companies over another,” said FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield. Pai plans by March 2 to delay the implementation the data security rules, Wigfield said. Some other aspects of the rules are under review by the White House Office of Management and Budget. A temporary stay is a first step toward permanently blocking the rules, analysts said Friday. The rules would subject broadband internet service providers to more stringent requirements than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google. Providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information and Web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. For less sensitive information such as email addresses or service tiers, consumers would be able to opt out. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn said in a statement Friday that “Chairman Pai is determined to take action that leaves consumers without a cop on the beat protecting their personal information from misuse by their broadband service provider.” Several Democrats in the U.S. Congress also criticized the move. Republican commissioners including Pai, said in October the rules unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising. Pai said in October the FCC “adopted one-sided rules that will cement edge providers’ dominance in the online advertising market.” Google and Facebook account for about two-thirds of all digital ad revenue. Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who authored the privacy rules, said on Friday that they are necessary because consumers have few options when it comes to broadband providers. “The fact of the matter is it’s the consumer’s information,” he said. “It’s not the network’s information.” Berin Szóka, president of TechFreedom, said Pai’s decision was a good move because “because the real question isn’t a policy question but a legal one: does the FCC even have authority to regulate broadband privacy?” ","

Don't show this again Ask Maggie: CNET's Marguerite Reardon offers advice to an AT&T subscriber considering replacing his long-held unlimited data plan with a new one. Unlimited data is back, and customers who held onto their old grandfathered unlimited plans finally have more choices. It couldn't be a better time to be in the market for an unlimited data plan for your mobile phone. Thanks to T-Mobile, which has been siphoning off customers from AT&T and Verizon, the big carriers have finally succumbed to the pressure. AT&T had been offering an unlimited data plan to customers signing up with DirecTV. But after Verizon launched its unlimited plan and T-Mobile countered by adding perks to its own unlimited options, AT&T came back with an even more compelling offer. Earlier this week it unveiled two new unlimited data plans. The first is a budget-friendly, stripped-down plan with limited speeds and standard-definition video, while its higher-end plan offers full high-definition video streaming and up to 10GB of Wi-Fi hotspot data. The constant back and forth between the carriers is good news for consumers who get to enjoy better prices and more options. In this edition of Ask Maggie, I help a longtime AT&T subscriber decide whether to ditch his old unlimited data plan for the new plan. Dear AT&T-lifer, The short answer is yes, you should definitely switch. AT&T's new pricing makes a compelling case for ditching your old plan. But you may want to shop around. AT&T is just one of the major carriers offering unlimited data plan specials. Even the premium unlimited offer, called Unlimited Plus, which is priced at $145 a month for two lines, will save you $20 a month. And you will get a lot more for your money. Not only will you get unlimited talk time, but you'll also be able to use your phones as mobile hotspots and get up to 10GB of data each month at 4G LTE speeds. That option isn't available under your current unlimited data plan. There are other perks, too. If you subscribe to the Unlimited Plus plan, AT&T will take $25 off the price of a subscription to its DirecTV, U-Verse TV or DirecTV Now service each month. AT&T says that this is a limited-time promotion and that it will start to apply the $25 credit after two to three billing periods. A couple of things to keep in mind. This pricing requires you to sign up for automatic bill paying. Video is set by default to stream at lower quality (480p resolution). But with the Unlimited Plus plan, you can manually turn that feature off to get high-definition streams. And like all the other major wireless carriers, AT&T might slow your data connection if you use more than 22GB of data in a month. If you're looking to save even more money and you don't mind surfing the net at slower speeds, you could consider the Unlimited Choice plan, which costs $115 for two lines. But keep in mind there are big caveats to this plan. Video streaming is only done at a lower-quality resolution. There's no hotspot feature. And all internet speeds are limited to 3 Mbps. And if you use more than 22GB of data in a given month, AT&T will slow you down even more. The good news for you is that the unlimited-data-plan-wars mean you don't have to be held hostage to AT&T's old unlimited data offer. Now you have the freedom to try another carrier without the fear of losing that unlimited data if it doesn't work out. And truth be told, you'll actually get a better deal from any of the other three major wireless carriers if you switch. With Sprint you can get two lines of unlimited data for $90 a month. T-Mobile will give you two lines of unlimited data for $100 a month. And Verizon charges $140 a month for two lines. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.

473, ,3022017,Reuters,2232017,"WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - Moody’s credit rating agency lowered its outlook for the U.S. telecommunications industry to negative from stable on Thursday  amid growing price competition for wireless services. Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer Mark Stodden forecast in a report that U.S. aggregate wireless industry cash flows would fall by 2 percent in 2017. Analysts have said that the industry’s push to compete on unlimited data plans could hurt profit margins, putting more pressure on carriers to control costs. In a shift in the price wars among the four biggest U.S. wireless carriers, Verizon Communications Inc last month said it would once again offer an unlimited pricing plan. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would be making the offer for the first time in more than five years. AT&T Inc , T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp all responded by sweetening their existing unlimited data plans. The Moody’s Corp report said T-Mobile’s strategy has “pushed its bigger peers to an unhealthy level of competition” and said the expansion of unlimited data plans would reduce the industry’s long-term revenue growth potential. At the same time, the new data plans will prompt more data usage and require more capital spending by carriers, Moody’s said, predicting a 7 percent growth in capital investment to fund network traffic volumes this year. The report predicts flat aggregate industry cash flow in 2018 after strong cash flows in 2015 and 2016. The shift is “in response to competitive pressures, with Verizon and AT&T now responding more deliberately, particularly to T-Mobile’s relentless marketing and expanding market share.” Stodden also said cable firms could pose an additional threat. Cable operators Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc have said they will launch wireless services on Verizon’s airwaves in 2017 and 2018, respectively. A tie-up of Sprint and T-Mobile “would reduce price pressure and provide a path back to aggregate industry cash growth,” the report said. Moody’s puts the odds of Trump administration regulators approving a tie-up at around one in three. Reuters reported on Feb. 17 that SoftBank Group Corp  is prepared to cede control of Sprint Corp to Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile to clinch a merger of the two U.S. carriers, citing people familiar with the matter. SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because U.S. regulators imposed strict anti-collusion rules during an airwaves auction. After the auction ends in April, the parties are expected to begin negotiations. In 2014, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. regulators.

474, ,3022017,Reuters,2232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new Republican head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission promised “light-touch” regulation of areas such as the internet, a dramatic shift away from the Obama administration’s approach to telecommunications oversight. Ajit Pai, whom President Donald Trump named in January to chair the FCC, said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that the agency made a “mistake” in 2015 when it adopted landmark “net neutrality rules” reclassifying internet service like a public utility. “The FCC decided to apply last-century, utility-style regulation to today’s broadband networks,” Pai said in prepared remarks released by his office. “Our new approach injected tremendous uncertainty into the broadband market,” he added.  “And uncertainty is the enemy of growth.” The Obama administration’s net neutrality rules, which a federal appeals court upheld, bar internet access providers from slowing consumers’ access to web content. Pai has not disclosed his plans to reverse the rules, but he has emphasized he is committed to ensuring an open internet. “We are confident in the decades-long, cross-party consensus on light-touch Internet regulation — one that helped America’s digital economy thrive,” Pai said. “Our approach will be not zero regulation, but light-touch regulation — rules backed by long-standing principles of competition law.” Pai said on Monday that he would not review AT&T Inc’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. In December he vowed to take a “weed whacker” to unneeded rules and said net neutrality’s “days are numbered.” Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder for them to manage traffic and discourage investing in additional capacity, while websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. Pai cannot simply issue an order doing away with the net neutrality rules but must go through an administrative process. He has not disclosed his plans, saying he will mount a “careful look at the regulatory framework.” Last month Tom Wheeler, then the FCC’s chairman, said reversing the net neutrality rules “is not a slam dunk.” Earlier this month, Pai sent letters to Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T to notify them that the FCC was closing investigations into “sponsored data” or “zero rating” programs in which mobile phone companies give customers free data for using certain video services. The FCC had previously raised concerns about those policies. Pai also is moving to block some stricter privacy rules on internet providers that are set to take effect Thursday. ","

475,Charles Bovaird,3022017,Investopedia,2232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs President Donald Trump's proposal to cut the top federal tax rate on business income to 15% would provide windfalls for certain companies such as financial services institution Visa Inc. (V) and retailer Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY), which generally pay close to the top rate of 35%, according to CNBC. Many investors will likely focus on Trump's joint address to Congress on February 28, during which he is expected to discuss his plans for tax reform, The Washington Post reported. However, many firms will likely derive little benefit from such tax reform, as they already have an effective tax rate below 15%. (For more, see also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.) While there are many companies that have paid a low effective rate in recent years, a perfect example is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The online retailer has enjoyed an effective tax rate of 11% on its domestic income over the last eight years, according to CNBC. Amazon harnessed several special deductions, including ones involving accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, and research and development credits, according to the company's annual report. Amazon is not alone in benefiting from this special treatment, as companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) are ""routinely able to reduce their tax bill,"" Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at tax policy think tank Citizens for Tax Justice (CTH) told CNBC. Amid this situation, Exxon Mobil and AT&T Inc. (T) paid effective tax rates of 14% and 7% between 2008 and 2012, CTJ data reveals. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and General Electric Company (GE) both had negative rates during that time, paying 2% and 11%,respectively. However, the special deductions that these companies have been leveraging are likely to disappear under Trump's plan, Stephan Unger, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Investopedia during an interview. The ""current special deduction possibilities are likely to get abandoned to make the system more transparent and efficient,"" he said. However, whether or not ""special tax treatments for specific companies"" will end up disappearing completely remains unclear, stated Unger. Tax expert Nate Smith offered a different point of view, stating during a separate interview with Investopedia that while ""certain industries (like oil and gas) benefit from specific deductions ... the deduction provisions that could be disappearing are not the thrust of what Trump's reform would target."" The more important matter is changing tax law so that companies will repatriate profits, said Smith. Currently, multinational corporations can keep these earnings overseas indefinitely, shielding them from the higher tax rates, he told Investopedia. Frequently, managing their international footprint is the means of minimizing tax expenses, said Smith. Originally, Trump's campaign tax proposal sought to rectify this situation, he noted. (For more, see also: Can Trump Tax Plan Bring Back Overseas Cash?) Because of policies like these, many global companies are paying very little in the way of taxes, Tenpao Lee, interim dean and professor of economics at Niagara University, stated during an Investopedia interview. Should lawmakers cut the top corporate income tax rate to 15%, it would give major companies greater motivation to move their profits back to the United States. However, the impact may not take effect immediately, said Lee, as companies would need time to adjust. For companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), the effect would be significant, whereas companies like Exxon Mobil and Amazon would see less of an impact, he told Investopedia.

There's going to be a lot at stake for investors in regional telcos next week. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) reports quarterly results shortly after Monday's market close. Windstream Holdings (NASDAQ:WIN) follows two days later, announcing its fresh financials on Wednesday morning. Things didn't go so well last time out for either company. Shares of Frontier plummeted 23% for the week when it posted poorly received third-quarter results. Windstream fared relatively better, shedding just 4% of its value the week that it posted its third-quarter results. Both reports were still problematic. A huge acquisition last year may beef up Frontier's metrics in the near term, but its organic business continues to fade. The $10.54 billion deal for Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline operations in California, Texas, and Florida was initially seen as a way for Frontier to take a big step up. The Verizon deal added 3.7 million landline accounts to Frontier's roster during last year's second quarter, and perhaps more importantly it also picked up 2.2 million high-speed data accounts, including 1.6 million FiOS internet users and 1.2 million FiOS cable television customers. Beefing up its base of accounts for its fiber-optic and copper networks is important, because folks keep cutting the cord. Frontier's residential customer count declined from 5.228 million to 5.073 million as the third quarter played itself out. Monthly churn is on the rise, and average monthly revenue per residential account is declining. It experienced a slight sequential dip in business customers, too, but at least those accounts are spending more. Windstream's report was no treat. It posted a much wider loss than analysts were expecting. However, the market generally liked the $1.1 billion deal to acquire EarthLink (NASDAQ:ELNK) that was made official at the time of its earnings. The EarthLink move prompted an analyst upgrade from Cowen. Wall Street wouldn't have been as warm to Windstream if it had to rely solely on its shrinking legacy business. Image source: Frontier Communications. Windstream shares are back to where they were just before its bumpy third quarter, but Frontier stock has yet to claw its way back from the 23% hole that it dug itself into last time out. The stocks will likely make big moves -- up or down -- based on how their quarterly reports go in the next few days. Analysts see Frontier clocking in with $2.5 billion in revenue, a 76% surge since the prior year, but that includes the needle-moving Verizon accounts it picked up during the second quarter of last year. Wall Street pros see a modest quarterly loss of $0.05 a share -- Frontier's third straight quarterly deficit. Windstream's eyeing another rough quarter. Analysts are forecasting revenue to decline 6% to $1.34 billion in Wednesday's pre-open report. They see a chunky loss of $0.63 a share for the period. Windstream recently received regulatory approval to close on its deal with EarthLink, a move that will create a top-line bounce that, like Frontier, will not be organic. The big draw to both stocks continues to be their fat dividends. Frontier and Windstream are currently yielding 12.5% and 8.3%, respectively. The sustainability of those distributions over the long haul will always be dubious until the companies secure steady organic growth, but the wild trading in both stocks is also proof that yield chasers aren't always buying into risk-averse situations. Things won't be quiet for either stock next week. ","

Kline,3022017,Fool,2232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Like a kid who seems smart but always has an excuse for not doing his homework, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) has posted another drop in customers but has a reason for it. In the first two quarters of the year, the company blamed various factors caused by its $10.54 billion purchase of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline customers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) as the reason its subscriber base moved in the wrong direction. At first, the company said falling customer counts were due to problems during the cutover, and after that CEO Dan McCarthy blamed a slowdown in marketing efforts while Frontier normalized operations in the former Verizon territories. During the Q3 earnings call, transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required), the CEO said that ""CTF subscriber trends improved sequentially in the third quarter, although it is not yet at the rate we are targeting."" He also made it clear that in Q4, the company expected improved results. ""As we ramp marketing and adjust our offers, we expect continued improvements in net subscriber performance in the fourth quarter,"" McCarthy said. ""We anticipate exiting the year at or close to normal levels of customer activity that would support a more stable revenue performance in CTF."" At no point did McCarthy mention that the company faced an issue with customers who didn't pay their bills in the territories acquired from Verizon. In the Q4 earnings release, however, Frontier again lost subscribers and placed the blame at least party on the ""resolution of non-paying acquired CTF accounts."" The company added that it has experienced an ""improved trend in broadband in both legacy and CTF markets, excluding impact of non-paying account resolution."" This may not be McCarthy saying the dog ate his homework, but it does sound like an excuse. Subscriber counts were down in Q4, and the company posted a net loss of $80 million, but there was some good news in the earnings report as well. If Frontier customers keep leaving, the company will have a serious problem. Image source: Getty Images. In Q4 Frontier saw its total residential customer base drop from 5.03 million at the end of Q3 to 4.89 million to close the year. That's a drop of 144,000 subscribers, not appreciably different from the 155,000 lost in Q3. In addition, Frontier's business customer base dropped by 16,000, and it lost 96,000 broadband customers, as well as 84,000 video subscribers. That compares with a loss of 12,000 business customers, 99,000 broadband homes, and 92,000 video subscribers in the previous quarter. On top of that, residential average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped by even more than it did from Q2 to Q3, falling from $82.34 to $80.33. In the previous quarter, ARPU fell to $82.24 from $83.20. Business ARPU, which had climbed in Q3 by a little over $10, dropped slightly, losing $3.26 to come in at $6.65.04. Revenue also dropped in Q4, from $2.52 billion in Q3 to $2.40 billion in the year's final quarter. The company blamed $45 million of that dip on ""resolution of CTF accounts that were determined to be non-paying following an intensified effort to address overdue accounts."" Frontier expects the impact of the resolution process to decline to $25 million in Q1 2017 and said the ""initiative is nearly complete"" and that the company ""expects to be processing overdue accounts in a normal manner before the end of the first quarter."" In theory, the non-paying-accounts issue should be a one-time problem, and while it's hard to put a lot of faith in the company's ability to gain or hold customers, it does do a good job managing costs. McCarthy, in his remarks in the earnings release, said the company has made significant progress in its efforts to position ""our company to deliver a better customer experience and improved financial performance, with greater financial flexibility."" He specifically cited Frontier's reorganization into separate commercial and consumer business units, and the earnings release mentioned that the company has reorganized its credit facilities. Under the new terms, all of its agreements are now combined into one, while payment terms have been extended from 2018 to 2022. In addition, as its customer base shrinks, Frontier has once again found new ways to save money. ""We now expect annualized cost synergies of $1.6 billion to be achieved by mid-year 2018, up from the $1.4 billion target outlined in the 2016 third-quarter earnings report, and a full year earlier than anticipated,"" McCarthy said. ""We expect $1.25 billion of the $1.6 billion in synergies will be achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2017, which is a quarter earlier than previously announced."" Frontier has run out of excuses for its troubling loss of subscribers. It paid Verizon $10.54 billion for 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers, and it's slowly watching them walk out the door. The company appears to be well managed, and it has done a good job maximizing cost savings, but at some point you have to wonder if maybe those savings are costing Frontier subscribers. Going forward, McCarthy needs to show the needle moving in the right direction, or at least that there's a bottom to these drops. ","

Sometimes Mr. Market gets confused and prices companies at a premium or discount to their true value. While big companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) historically trade at a discount to the overall market, they're currently trading at an even deeper discount than usual. Verizon's share price has mostly stood still while the market continued to rally over the past year. Apple, meanwhile, is trading around the same P/E ratio as it did at the beginning of last year, while the S&P 500 is trading 21% higher on a P/E basis. Let's look at the numbers and see why both these tech titans are trading at massive discounts. Wall Street might be missing something on these two. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon's P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months is a mere 15.5. On a forward basis, it's just 12.9. That compares with the S&P 500's trailing P/E of 26.9. Verizon is trading at just 0.58 times the P/E ratio of the broader index. The last time it was even below 0.65 was in 2002, when the telecom industry tanked, according to analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Historically, Verizon trades for just an 11% discount. The 42% discount it's trading at today represents a massive buying opportunity for long-term value investors -- not to mention that Verizon is also trading at a lower forward P/E compared with AT&T (NYSE:T), which trades for 14.3 times analysts' 2017 EPS estimates. At the same time, it's worth looking at why Mr. Market is placing such a hefty discount on the wireless carrier. First and foremost, the competition in the wireless industry is increasingly fierce. Pressure from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has finally gotten to Verizon, putting pressure on its pricing. Verizon recently introduced an unlimited-data plan in an effort to compete with the value offered by T-Mobile's plans. AT&T also bowed to the pressure, opening its unlimited-data plan to all customers and dropping the price. Image source: Verizon. However, the strength of Verizon's wireless network and its position on the leading edge of 5G network development give it a significant competitive advantage over the long term. Additionally, its massive retail customer base -- the largest in the U.S. wireless industry -- will continue to throw off cash for its investments in its wireless network and digital advertising and video. That should allow the stock to rise back up toward its usual valuation levels over time. In the meantime, investors can get a juicy 4.6% dividend for their patience. Shares of Apple have been on a tear over the last nine months, increasing 46%. That significantly outpaces the 14% increase the S&P 500 saw in the same period. But Apple was trading for a 35% discount on a P/E basis in 2015 and a 26% discount in 2016. The largest company in the market typically trades for a discount to the S&P 500, but not nearly as deep as Apple's. Over the past 10 years, the average discount for the largest company by market cap was 16% to the S&P 500's P/E, according to BMO Capital's Tim Long. Apple shares traded near that level in 2012, 2013, and 2014, but the market hasn't caught up with the explosion in earnings from the release of the iPhone 6 at the end of 2014. Today, Apple trades around a 25% discount to the S&P 500, below that 16% baseline. While the market is down on Apple's slow iPhone sales growth, there are a few reasons to believe Apple's earnings will continue to expand. The iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple First of all, the company continues to execute on its massive capital returns program. Share buybacks will force earnings per share to increase at a faster rate than net income. Second, Apple's services business continues to grow at a strong pace. Services revenue is higher margin than Apple's core revenue. As such, it has an outsize impact on Apple's profit growth. Investors looking for value have two great options with Verizon and Apple. While the latter is trading at an all-time high, it still has room to run. Meanwhile, Verizon is trading at historic lows while maintaining strong competitive advantages, indicating it should outpace the market from here. ","

483,Rich Duprey,3022017,Fool,2232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 20,000 for the first time last month and continues to set new records. Although investors tend to look at the index as a single entity, it is of course composed of 30 different companies, though they all don't affect the index equally. That's because the Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning pricier stocks in the index have a greater influence over its movements than do cheaper ones. Currently, Goldman Sachs, at more than $252 per share, has the greatest weight in the Dow, some 8.3%, while General Electric has the least, or 1%, as its stock trades at just over $30 a share. Image source: Getty Images. But the makeup of the Dow also changes over time, as companies are added to the index or dropped from it. The last time the components were changed was in 2015, when AT&T was removed and Apple added. Goldman Sachs, in fact, wasn't part of the Dow until 2013, when it, Nike, and Visa were put in and Alcoa, Bank of America, and Hewlett-Packard were taken out. The components have been changed 51 times since Charles Dow created the index in 1896, but the changes aren't made lightly, and you can still find 23 companies in the DJIA today that occupied that same space a decade ago. Unchanged Componentsof the Dow Jones Industrial Average,2007-2017 3M (NYSE:MMM) General Electric Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Home Depot (NYSE:HD) Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) Boeing (NYSE:BA) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) IBM (NYSE:IBM) United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Verizon (NYSE:VZ) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) DuPont (NYSE:DD) McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)(NYSE:MCD) Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Merck (NYSE:MRK) Ten years ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sat at around the 12,700 level and some might see parallels with today. Back then, the index was regularly hitting new highs and would go on to hit almost 14,000 just as the Great Recession hit, after which it would subsequently lose more than half its value. That it's nearly tripled over the past decade speaks to the strength of the components that comprise the Dow, but which one of these nearly two dozen stocks played the biggest role in its climb? Data sources: indexArb and Morningstar. Table by author. Looking at their total returns, the best performer was Home Depot, which generated 14.3% average annual returns for investors over the past 10 years, just ahead of McDonald's and Disney at around 13% each. That outsize performance certainly boosted the index's performance, but because of the Dow's price-weighting, which for the three of them averaged just above 4%, it probably would have muted their overall impact to a degree. So which stock came out on top? Industrial conglomerate 3M, which generated average annual returns of 10.6% and had the heaviest weighting of any of the 23 stocks at 6.07%. The combination of those two factors probably means it played a big role in the Dow index performance, and it should be remembered that this performance includes the 2008-2009 recession. http://www.3m.com.hk/wps/wcm/connect/db1c9bb5-2b2e-4db7-afef-1dd0b79f58fb/MovingIndustryForward_270.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-db1c9bb5-2b2e-4db7-afef-1dd0b79f58fb-kYXl7I6Image source: 3M. Shares of 3M have more than doubled over the past 10 years, and in the past 12 months alone they're up 20%, but with good reason. It generates annual sales in excess of $30 billion, produces huge amounts of free cash, and is a member of the Dividend Aristocrat club, having raised its dividend for 59 consecutive years, most recently by 6% to $1.175 per share. While its fourth-quarter earnings were hampered by a weak performance by its healthcare and consumer divisions that typically do better, its industrial end markets were much stronger, allowing it to reaffirm its growth prospects for the coming year as well as forecast profits of $8.45 to $8.80 a share. While it would have been nice to see its consumer-facing businesses perform well now that the industrial segment is firing properly, the latter represents one-third of its total revenues and will be key to the future. Image source: 3M. Although management is always looking to calve off slower growth businesses to focus on maintaining high-single-digit revenue growth over the long term, 3M plans to invest approximately $1.8 billion in research and development this year to support its organic growth initiatives. Yet even with its uneven performance this past quarter, each segment of the business generated operating margins near 20% or above. If 3M is able to continue producing the kinds of numbers it has been, the industrial and consumer giant may be able to avoid the shades of the downfall that befell the Dow Jones Industrial Average 10 years ago.

                                   first outside hire ever for the CMO role. He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about how the more than 100-year-old company is trying to appeal to the next generation of consumers. Following are edited excerpts of the conversation. WSJ: Tell me about how you arrived at Verizon. Scotti: The first time that I talked to [Verizon CEO] Lowell McAdam I said, ”I’m not a telco person, so why would you want somebody like me for this role?” His explanation was that our brand and our company are going to go through a big transformation. We really need to work on creating an emotional connection with our customers—current and future ones. Because as our industry gets more commoditized, if we don’t take that step, we won’t be as successful. And in order to do that he wanted to bring in somebody who has other experiences, not only the telco industry. Tell me about some of the company’s recent changes. Part of Lowell’s vision was that as we start thinking about the next-generation customers—that being millennials or Gen Z and whatever is coming next—we need to ensure that we are very relevant. And in order to do that, [being simple, personalizable and reliable] becomes really important. So when we heard that our service plans were not simple, we got rid of all our plans, and decided to do small, medium, large and extra large. The same way you buy your T-shirts, now you can get your plan. That’s something that people understand. A lot of people say that I did that because I came from J. Crew and all I do is think about T-shirts. That’s a little simplistic, but whatever, it works. The new My Verizon app was a tremendous innovation for us. Because we said we’re going to take the current app that we have, and we’re going to, like, burn it. And we’re going to start from scratch. If you’re going to create the remote control for your plan, what would it be? For these younger consumers who are dealing with brands like Uber—you can’t separate the app and the Uber service. The service and the app are the same thing. What do millennials look for in a cellphone carrier, and how does Verizon figure that out? There is this misconception that millennials are this very homogeneous group. That they all look, feel and act the same way. I think you can’t make that assertion about any group. We know this based on analytics and customer data: that there are plenty of young people out there who want quality. For these folks, the phone has become an intrinsic part of their lives. They put their phone in the context of, “My phone is everything to me. My phone is the remote control for my life. The phone is my life.” And because they are always on, they want to make sure that they have the best. These folks say “I want the best. I want the fastest speed, I want the best video quality and I also want solid customer service.” And I don’t mean customer service in the sense of calling and talking to somebody, but, “I want the support that I need when I need it.” When you start talking about young consumers, or millennials, there seems to be this understanding that there’s only one way of addressing the needs of millennials, and that is: Everything is free, everything is cheap, and everything is a bunch of young folks jumping around in a commercial with some type of very energetic music. And that’s a gross oversimplification. In our industry, that has caused a little bit of a race to the bottom: Let’s see how free free can be. Let’s not put emphasis on the quality or the experience, but on how free that experience is. But if somebody is looking for quality across a lot of aspects of their lives, then wireless is not different. Your go90 video app is in a totally different position in the market than Verizon. You’ve got something that’s trying to appeal to young people and doesn’t have much brand identity yet. How do you approach that? You want to create brands that have strong appeal with consumers. So we do a lot of consumer research, talking a lot to consumers, and trying to understand the essence of those brands. So not just put a name on there and then launch it. But second of all, what does it take to create a brand? I’m not just talking about putting a lot of advertising dollars to put a name out there. But especially in this day and age, it’s how it’s going to connect with consumers in their lives. So what is the pitch for go90 then, in its essence? What go90 is trying to do is to be a distribution platform for amazing mobile-first content. And that’s something that doesn’t really exist in the marketplace. We talked about the short-form, bite-size content that every millennial loves on YouTube, for example—what’s the HBO-quality equivalent of that? That doesn’t exist. So a lot of the work that we’ve been doing is to say, OK, let’s bring that quality and appeal to this new generation. It doesn’t carry the Verizon brand. No, because we thought that it was a good way to create this separate brand that would carry its appeal on its own. How does it all fit into the bigger challenge? You mentioned that one of the pressures coming on the telecommunications industry is the commoditization of it. It’s been something that telecoms have always been struggling with since the dawn of the iPhone, of not being just a dumb pipe. How does that influence the broader strategy that you’re trying to unveil with go90 and your Hum technology for drivers and the marketing? There is definitely a perspective that says that we want to be the one-stop shop for our customers across the digital world. But that doesn’t mean you can do it with one brand all the time in all cases. In this day and age it’s not like that. And the logo change was trying to be a friendlier appearance? Friendlier, and also our logo was 15 years old. It was just looking tired. We had so many different iterations of the logo that this was a way of appealing to the next generation of customers. Simplifying. The check mark was signaling this notion of reliability. Ryan Knutson is a Wall Street Journal reporter in New York. He can be reached at ryan.knutson@wsj.com.

Don't show this again Ask Maggie: CNET's Marguerite Reardon offers advice to an AT&T subscriber considering replacing his long-held unlimited data plan with a new one. Unlimited data is back, and customers who held onto their old grandfathered unlimited plans finally have more choices. It couldn't be a better time to be in the market for an unlimited data plan for your mobile phone. Thanks to T-Mobile, which has been siphoning off customers from AT&T and Verizon, the big carriers have finally succumbed to the pressure. AT&T had been offering an unlimited data plan to customers signing up with DirecTV. But after Verizon launched its unlimited plan and T-Mobile countered by adding perks to its own unlimited options, AT&T came back with an even more compelling offer. Earlier this week it unveiled two new unlimited data plans. The first is a budget-friendly, stripped-down plan with limited speeds and standard-definition video, while its higher-end plan offers full high-definition video streaming and up to 10GB of Wi-Fi hotspot data. The constant back and forth between the carriers is good news for consumers who get to enjoy better prices and more options. In this edition of Ask Maggie, I help a longtime AT&T subscriber decide whether to ditch his old unlimited data plan for the new plan. Dear AT&T-lifer, The short answer is yes, you should definitely switch. AT&T's new pricing makes a compelling case for ditching your old plan. But you may want to shop around. AT&T is just one of the major carriers offering unlimited data plan specials. Even the premium unlimited offer, called Unlimited Plus, which is priced at $145 a month for two lines, will save you $20 a month. And you will get a lot more for your money. Not only will you get unlimited talk time, but you'll also be able to use your phones as mobile hotspots and get up to 10GB of data each month at 4G LTE speeds. That option isn't available under your current unlimited data plan. There are other perks, too. If you subscribe to the Unlimited Plus plan, AT&T will take $25 off the price of a subscription to its DirecTV, U-Verse TV or DirecTV Now service each month. AT&T says that this is a limited-time promotion and that it will start to apply the $25 credit after two to three billing periods. A couple of things to keep in mind. This pricing requires you to sign up for automatic bill paying. Video is set by default to stream at lower quality (480p resolution). But with the Unlimited Plus plan, you can manually turn that feature off to get high-definition streams. And like all the other major wireless carriers, AT&T might slow your data connection if you use more than 22GB of data in a month. If you're looking to save even more money and you don't mind surfing the net at slower speeds, you could consider the Unlimited Choice plan, which costs $115 for two lines. But keep in mind there are big caveats to this plan. Video streaming is only done at a lower-quality resolution. There's no hotspot feature. And all internet speeds are limited to 3 Mbps. And if you use more than 22GB of data in a given month, AT&T will slow you down even more. The good news for you is that the unlimited-data-plan-wars mean you don't have to be held hostage to AT&T's old unlimited data offer. Now you have the freedom to try another carrier without the fear of losing that unlimited data if it doesn't work out. And truth be told, you'll actually get a better deal from any of the other three major wireless carriers if you switch. With Sprint you can get two lines of unlimited data for $90 a month. T-Mobile will give you two lines of unlimited data for $100 a month. And Verizon charges $140 a month for two lines. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy, which we encourage you to read. Discussion threads can be closed at any time at our discretion.

486, ,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - Moody’s credit rating agency lowered its outlook for the U.S. telecommunications industry to negative from stable on Thursday  amid growing price competition for wireless services. Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer Mark Stodden forecast in a report that U.S. aggregate wireless industry cash flows would fall by 2 percent in 2017. Analysts have said that the industry’s push to compete on unlimited data plans could hurt profit margins, putting more pressure on carriers to control costs. In a shift in the price wars among the four biggest U.S. wireless carriers, Verizon Communications Inc last month said it would once again offer an unlimited pricing plan. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would be making the offer for the first time in more than five years. AT&T Inc , T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp all responded by sweetening their existing unlimited data plans. The Moody’s Corp report said T-Mobile’s strategy has “pushed its bigger peers to an unhealthy level of competition” and said the expansion of unlimited data plans would reduce the industry’s long-term revenue growth potential. At the same time, the new data plans will prompt more data usage and require more capital spending by carriers, Moody’s said, predicting a 7 percent growth in capital investment to fund network traffic volumes this year. The report predicts flat aggregate industry cash flow in 2018 after strong cash flows in 2015 and 2016. The shift is “in response to competitive pressures, with Verizon and AT&T now responding more deliberately, particularly to T-Mobile’s relentless marketing and expanding market share.” Stodden also said cable firms could pose an additional threat. Cable operators Comcast Corp and Charter Communications Inc have said they will launch wireless services on Verizon’s airwaves in 2017 and 2018, respectively. A tie-up of Sprint and T-Mobile “would reduce price pressure and provide a path back to aggregate industry cash growth,” the report said. Moody’s puts the odds of Trump administration regulators approving a tie-up at around one in three. Reuters reported on Feb. 17 that SoftBank Group Corp  is prepared to cede control of Sprint Corp to Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile to clinch a merger of the two U.S. carriers, citing people familiar with the matter. SoftBank has not yet approached Deutsche Telekom to discuss any deal because U.S. regulators imposed strict anti-collusion rules during an airwaves auction. After the auction ends in April, the parties are expected to begin negotiations. In 2014, SoftBank abandoned talks to acquire T-Mobile for Sprint amid opposition from U.S. regulators.

489, ,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"(Reuters) - U.S. electronics chain RadioShack Corp filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday for the second time in a little over two years, faced with a challenging retail environment and an unsatisfying partnership with wireless provider Sprint Corp. The Chapter 11 filing comes after RadioShack, owned by General Wireless Operations Inc, tried to revitalize its business by co-branding stores with the wireless carrier in an effort to compete against their largest rivals. General Wireless, which acquired the RadioShack brand in 2015, listed assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million in the U.S. bankruptcy court for the Delaware district. RadioShack will close approximately 200 stores and will evaluate options on the remaining 1,300, the company said in a statement. Sprint will convert several hundred locations into Sprint corporate-owned stores, the wireless provider said in a separate statement. RadioShack’s bankruptcy filing and subsequent store closings are not material to Sprint’s overall sales results, Sprint added. RadioShack, a nearly 100-year-old chain that captured the heart of electronics enthusiasts for its specialty products such as “walkie talkies”, first filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after the rise of mobile phones caught it off-guard and customers abandoned its stores for big box competitors including Best Buy Co Inc and Amazon.com Inc. In an attempt to keep the doors open on 1,740 stores, RadioShack struck a partnership with Sprint during its bankruptcy, inviting the mobile carrier to co-brand with the company and set up smaller stores within its own. At the time, Sprint viewed RadioShack’s retail footprint as a way to quickly scale up its own business and RadioShack hoped to benefit from increased liquidity in the form of rent and commission payments from Sprint. But, in the years since RadioShack has emerged from bankruptcy, both Sprint and RadioShack have been challenged. Sprint, whose network is viewed by analysts as inferior to the country’s largest carriers, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, has been forced to offer heavy discounts to grow its business. Sprint’s challenges, which led to sales dropping “precipitously” toward the end of last year, meant RadioShack received less than expected in commission, RadioShack said in papers filed on Wednesday. “The Sprint relationship did not yield the benefits” RadioShack was anticipating, it said. RadioShack, meanwhile, has struggled to compete against internet behemoth Amazon.com and for the attention of shoppers who increasingly wait for deep discounts before making a purchase. The influx of cheaper copycat consumer products manufactured abroad has also hurt the business. Still, in the years since its first bankruptcy, RadioShack has focused on expanding its private label offerings, which include drones, radios and adapters, and now makes up the majority of its business. The shift away from selling other retailers’ products to its own has helped it reduce operating expenses and increase gross profit. ","

Kline,3092017,Fool,3022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Picking Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) over Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) would require believing that both companies would have a major change in direction ahead. Frontier has been sputtering since its $10.54 billion purchase of what were once Verizon's wireline customers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). Since closing that deal on April 1, Frontier has disappointed. The company has lost subscribers in all three quarters since it purchased the CTF properties, and while it has achieved significant cost savings from roughly doubling in size, there are legitimate concerns it may not be able to reverse its subscriber loss. Verizon, for its part, has not been perfect. The company has been adding customers, but total revenue declined 4.3% in 2016. Still, while Frontier lost $373 million in 2016, almost double its $196 million loss in 2015, Verizon remains decidedly profitable. The company saw its earnings per share dip from $4.38 in 2015 to $3.22 in 2016, a number it expects to be ""fairly consistent with 2016,"" according to its Q4 earnings release. Both of these companies are struggling with at least some of the same problems. Consumers have more choices, and that creates pricing as well as service pressure. Verizon isn't flying as high as it once was, but Frontier has yet to show that it can actually make money. FTR data by YCharts When you're thinking about buying a stock, it's sometimes worth considering where you'll be buying in. Frontier, for example, has been heading steadily in the wrong direction. That slide has been well earned, because so far, through three quarters of owning the CTF properties, very little has gone right. In Q4, Frontier saw its total residential customer base drop from 5.03 million at the end of Q3 to 4.89 million to close the year. That's a drop of 144,000 subscribers, not appreciably different from the 155,000 lost in Q3. In addition, Frontier's business-customer base dropped by 16,000, and it lost 96,000 broadband customers as well as 84,000 video subscribers. That compares with a loss of 12,000 business customers, 99,000 broadband homes, and 92,000 video subscribers in the previous quarter. Average revenue per residential user, which climbed in Q2 after the Verizon deal was completed, has dropped in Q3 and Q4. In addition, overall revenue has fallen steadily, which makes sense, given fewer subscribers and falling revenue per remaining subscriber equation. Where the company has succeeded is in delivering cost-saving efficiencies from the acquisition. It has steadily increased its annualized cost synergy target since taking over the CTF properties. Currently, that number stands at ""$1.6 billion, with $1.25 billion to be realized by end of Q1 2017, and $1.6 billion by end of Q2 2018,"" according to the Q4 earnings release. It's in that operating efficiency where you can make a case for Frontier. Its CEO, Dan McCarthy, has shown a strong ability to manage the company well, and if he can deliver the subscriber turnaround he has promised (and failed to deliver on) for the past two quarters, then the upside here could be high. Verizon stock has much less risk. Image source: Verizon. Verizon may struggle in a changing climate that pushes its margin and profit down. It's unlikely, however, that the company will see a major collapse in its revenue, and it's possible that after a transition it will return to revenue growth. Frontier, on the other hand, is a boom-or-bust proposition. The company may not have hit bottom, but it can certainly see it, and it's either going to make a roaring comeback or sell its currently dwindling-value assets at a less-than-premium price. The company has recently revised its revolving credit line to buy it more time to create its turnaround. It won't take much more than the next year to see if McCarthy can deliver subscriber growth (which would allow it to stay on its own) or at least stabilize things (which would at least allow for a sale at a premium price). Going forward, however, while Verizon has a much pricier stock, it's also the better value. The company has much less downside risk and a better chance of getting things moving in the right direction. Verizon's not going to go bankrupt or be sold under distress. There's a stronger chance that happens with Frontier than with the company actually managed to reverse its negative trends. ","

495,Adam Levy,3092017,Fool,3022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the last of the four major U.S. wireless carriers to succumb to the pressure and offer an unlimited data plan. For the longest time, Verizon resisted pressure from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) to offer an unlimited plan. As recently as the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, CFO Matt Ellis said, ""That's not something we feel we need to do,"" when asked about unlimited data plans. But Verizon finally made the move, and it has both positives and negatives for investors. What should investors expect, and will the new unlimited plan from Verizon produce positive returns? Image source: Verizon It's only been a few weeks since Verizon launched its unlimited plan, but a lot of people have been signing up. ""We've seen a pretty huge rush to unlimited,"" President of Operations John Stratton said at a Deutsche Bank conference earlier this month. Early demand may be strong enough to break Verizon's two-year streak of postpaid phone subscriber losses in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, Verizon lost 138,000 postpaid phone subscribers, and it lost 8,000 in 2016 during the first quarter. Combined with a promotion for a free iPhone 7, Verizon should be able to post a positive number in the first quarter this year. Stratton also said, ""The first guys that you see come across are typically the ones who benefit greatest sort of on their bottom of the bill."" In other words, customers who were paying more for a limited data bucket are the first to switch to the unlimited data plan. Therefore, Verizon could see a dip in its average revenue per user (ARPU), which has already come under pressure as customers switch to device installment plans and hold onto their phones longer. Verizon's plan pricing is also feeling pressure from lower-priced competitors like T-Mobile and Sprint. In the long run, however, Stratton says: ""This is not a dilutive thing from an ARPU perspective. We think it's at least an even play because of where we priced it and how we laid it in."" Verizon maintains it will return to service revenue growth by next year. With every major U.S. wireless provider offering unlimited data now, the conversation is no longer about how much data you get, but about network quality. This is an area where Verizon shines. It's ranked at the top of RootMetrics' surveys for three years straight. Its pricing, while not as low as T-Mobile's or Sprint's, is still competitive, and with its brand and network strength, it should be able to maintain its premium price point. By focusing the conversation on network quality, Verizon is setting itself up to win more customers. People want the best, even if the best is only the best by a little bit. Verizon holds the least amount of spectrum airwaves of the four major U.S. wireless providers. That's unlikely to change even after the recent incentive spectrum auction. In order to maintain its network advantage, Verizon plans to spend a lot of money densifying its network to improve performance in high-population areas. Analyst Craig Moffett expects Verizon to spend $11.3 billion of its $22 billion capital spending budget on its wireless operations. By comparison, he expects T-Mobile and Sprint to spend just $5.1 billion and $3 billion, respectively. But while Verizon may be seemingly outspending its smaller competitors, on a per-subscriber basis, Verizon is spending about the same amount as T-Mobile, although it's still spending significantly more than Sprint. It will be very difficult for Verizon to maintain its network lead without spending even more. There are a lot of puts and takes with Verizon's new unlimited plan. The potential costs in both capital spending and lost service revenue are significant. Still, investors should consider what Verizon's performance would look like without the unlimited plan at all. With the growing demand for more mobile video and social media, Verizon can't afford not to offer unlimited data. It's more important for it to hold onto customers and attract new ones at a slightly lower price than to stand still and watch service revenue decline year after year. ","

Rough times continue for Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) shareholders. The regional telco's stock took a 14.8% hit following a rough close to 2016. Frontier Communications saw revenue clock in at $2.41 billion, a 71% year-over-year pop but short of the 76% advance that analysts were targeting. We need to frame Frontier's growth appropriately for a fair comparison. The $10.54 billion deal  for Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline operations in California, Texas, and Florida added millions of revenue-padding accounts is inflating Frontier's financial performance. The deal closed during the second quarter, so pitting Frontier's fourth quarter to its third quarter is the best gauge, and the sequential comparison is pretty problematic. Revenue slipped from $2.52 million during the third quarter. A chunk of that shortfall came from the resolution of the Verizon-acquired accounts that were determined to deadbeat customers, but there were still sequential declines in both Verizon and its legacy residential accounts. Frontier Communications went from servicing an 5.04 million residential customers at the end of September to 4.89 million three months later. It had 5.23 million residential accounts at the end of the second quarter. Making matters worse, those who did stick around are paying less for service. Average monthly residential revenue per customer has declined from $82.34 to $80.33 between the third and fourth quarters. There was also a sequential dip in its corporate accounts and the average spent by those clients. Image source: Frontier Communications. The news didn't get any better on the bottom line, where Frontier's net loss widened to $0.12 a share. Income investors flocking to Frontier for its juicy dividend -- yielding 14.6% after last week's slide -- should be rightfully worried about the telco's ability to sustain its lofty distributions as organic revenue shrinks and deficits keep mounting. Frontier is tackling its overhead. Frontier expects annualized cost synergies to come to $1.6 billion by the middle of next year, up from its earlier target of $1.4 billion in savings by mid-2019. Volatility has become an old friend for Frontier shareholders. If last week's nearly 15% slide seems fierce, investors suffered a 23% hit for the week when it posted rough third-quarter results three months ago. Frontier stock also hasn't been kind outside of earnings announcements. The shares hit their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick downgraded the stock following the rough quarter, taking his rating from overweight to neutral. Frontier's guidance for free cash flow in the year ahead -- eyeing between $800 million and $1 billion adjusted free cash flow for all of 2017 -- is disappointing, and Cusick wonders about the sustainability of its beefy payouts. He is suspending his price target on the stock. Frontier isn't toast. However, there are some real challenges as it tries to upgrade its offerings and its support while still shaving costs. Investors tempted by the fat dividend will want to make sure that the stock doesn't suffer yet another double-digit percentage hit when it reports first-quarter results in a few months. A big dividend isn't a deal if the stock is falling by a lot more than the distributions. ","
      
    Can Frontier Stock Bounce Back After Last Week's 15% Drop? -- The Motley Fool

497,Adam Levy,3092017,Fool,3022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Sometimes Mr. Market gets confused and prices companies at a premium or discount to their true value. While big companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) historically trade at a discount to the overall market, they're currently trading at an even deeper discount than usual. Verizon's share price has mostly stood still while the market continued to rally over the past year. Apple, meanwhile, is trading around the same P/E ratio as it did at the beginning of last year, while the S&P 500 is trading 21% higher on a P/E basis. Let's look at the numbers and see why both these tech titans are trading at massive discounts. Wall Street might be missing something on these two. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon's P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months is a mere 15.5. On a forward basis, it's just 12.9. That compares with the S&P 500's trailing P/E of 26.9. Verizon is trading at just 0.58 times the P/E ratio of the broader index. The last time it was even below 0.65 was in 2002, when the telecom industry tanked, according to analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Historically, Verizon trades for just an 11% discount. The 42% discount it's trading at today represents a massive buying opportunity for long-term value investors -- not to mention that Verizon is also trading at a lower forward P/E compared with AT&T (NYSE:T), which trades for 14.3 times analysts' 2017 EPS estimates. At the same time, it's worth looking at why Mr. Market is placing such a hefty discount on the wireless carrier. First and foremost, the competition in the wireless industry is increasingly fierce. Pressure from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has finally gotten to Verizon, putting pressure on its pricing. Verizon recently introduced an unlimited-data plan in an effort to compete with the value offered by T-Mobile's plans. AT&T also bowed to the pressure, opening its unlimited-data plan to all customers and dropping the price. Image source: Verizon. However, the strength of Verizon's wireless network and its position on the leading edge of 5G network development give it a significant competitive advantage over the long term. Additionally, its massive retail customer base -- the largest in the U.S. wireless industry -- will continue to throw off cash for its investments in its wireless network and digital advertising and video. That should allow the stock to rise back up toward its usual valuation levels over time. In the meantime, investors can get a juicy 4.6% dividend for their patience. Shares of Apple have been on a tear over the last nine months, increasing 46%. That significantly outpaces the 14% increase the S&P 500 saw in the same period. But Apple was trading for a 35% discount on a P/E basis in 2015 and a 26% discount in 2016. The largest company in the market typically trades for a discount to the S&P 500, but not nearly as deep as Apple's. Over the past 10 years, the average discount for the largest company by market cap was 16% to the S&P 500's P/E, according to BMO Capital's Tim Long. Apple shares traded near that level in 2012, 2013, and 2014, but the market hasn't caught up with the explosion in earnings from the release of the iPhone 6 at the end of 2014. Today, Apple trades around a 25% discount to the S&P 500, below that 16% baseline. While the market is down on Apple's slow iPhone sales growth, there are a few reasons to believe Apple's earnings will continue to expand. The iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple First of all, the company continues to execute on its massive capital returns program. Share buybacks will force earnings per share to increase at a faster rate than net income. Second, Apple's services business continues to grow at a strong pace. Services revenue is higher margin than Apple's core revenue. As such, it has an outsize impact on Apple's profit growth. Investors looking for value have two great options with Verizon and Apple. While the latter is trading at an all-time high, it still has room to run. Meanwhile, Verizon is trading at historic lows while maintaining strong competitive advantages, indicating it should outpace the market from here. ","

Dividend-paying stocks as a group tend to hold up better during recessions and market crashes than their non-dividend counterparts, and tend to perform better over long periods of time. Since choosing individual stocks isn't right for everyone, there are some solid exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, investors can use to get dividend stock exposure in their portfolios. Two high-paying options are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund (NYSEMKT:DHS), so here's a look at the similarities and differences between them. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which currently includes 412 stocks with above-average dividend yields, and specifically excludes real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of this writing, the fund pays a 2.8% dividend yield. Image Source: Getty Images. As I mentioned, the fund has more than 400 stocks in its portfolio, but it is somewhat ""top heavy"", meaning that the fund's largest holdings make up a large portion of its assets. In fact, the 10 largest stock holdings account for nearly one-third of the Vanguard fund's assets. Here's a breakdown of the fund's 10 largest positions, and how much each one accounts for: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets Microsoft 2.43% 5.4% ExxonMobil 3.62% 3.8% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.4% JPMorgan Chase 2.09% 3.4% Wells Fargo 2.59% 3.1% General Electric 3.20% 2.9% AT&T 4.67% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.6% Chevron 3.82% 2.3% Verizon Communications 4.62% 2.2% Source: Vanguard. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. The Vanguard High Dividend ETF has $25 billion in assets under management, and has a rock-bottom 0.08% expense ratio. This means that on a $10,000 investment, the annual fees and fund expenses you'll pay are just $8. The WisdomTree High Dividend Fund has a similar objective as the Vanguard product. It aims to track the performance of the WisdomTree High Dividend Index, a proprietary index of high-dividend U.S. companies that contains 439 stocks as I write this, just slightly more than the Vanguard fund's underlying index. The WisdomTree fund is significantly smaller, with just $1.3 billion in assets under management and a 0.38% expense ratio. Currently, the fund's dividend yield is about 3.2%. And just like the Vanguard fund, the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund's 10 largest holdings account for about one-third of the fund's assets, although the composition is different: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets AT&T 4.67% 4.6% ExxonMobil 3.62% 4.2% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.5% Verizon Communications 4.62% 3.3% Chevron 3.82% 2.9% Pfizer 3.73% 2.9% Philip Morris 3.79% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.9% Wells Fargo 2.59% 2.8% General Electric 3.20% 2.8% Source: WisdomTree. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. As you can see, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two. There are eight stocks that are on both top-10 lists. While these funds are similar in many ways, there are a couple of key differences worth mentioning. The Vanguard fund has a significantly lower expense ratio (0.08% vs. 0.38%). Although I wouldn't call either fund's expense ratio excessive, Vanguard's is clearly the lower-cost option. This may seem like a small difference, but it can really add up over a period of several decades. On the other hand, the Vanguard fund specifically excludes REITs, while they are a big part of the WisdomTree Fund's underlying index. I've written many times about the long-term growth power of REITs, so for an investor like me, this can be a big plus. As of this writing, about 12% of the WisdomTree fund's assets are invested in the real estate sector, which could account for its slightly higher dividend yield. In terms of strategy and diversification, these funds are quite similar, even down to the number of stocks each one invests in and the respective dividend yields of each. However, the Vanguard fund is cheaper and the WisdomTree fund includes the real estate sector. While it's difficult to call one of these a better fund product than the other, the cost advantage of the Vanguard High Dividend ETF is the deciding factor for me. However, I have ample REIT exposure elsewhere in my portfolio -- if I didn't, I may be more willing to pay the WisdomTree fund's higher expense ratio. ","

502, ,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"(Reuters) - Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture formerly known as LightSquared Inc that emerged from bankruptcy in 2015, is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, according to people familiar with the matter. Another possibility under consideration is finding a new equity investor through a private placement, the people added, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. Representatives for Ligado, Goldman Sachs and PJT declined to comment. Ligado’s move to explore options comes as the company awaits approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use a portion of wireless airwaves in the so-called mid-band, which are spectrum frequencies that the company has said will help the telecom industry adopt 5G networks. 5G technology promises to be ten times to 100 times faster than current speeds. Ligado’s efforts to attract a new investment may be stymied by its large debt load, and uncertainty over the FCC’s approval for some of its wireless airwaves, according to the sources. Ligado exited bankruptcy in December 2015 with $1.5 billion in senior debt and $2.9 billion in junior debt, according to bankruptcy court documents. The company’s junior debt has recently been trading well below face value, at about 79 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns about full repayment. Backed by hedge fund manager Philip Falcone, LightSquared originally planned to build a nationwide wireless network when the FCC proposed to suspend its plans in 2012, saying that the network it was building interfered with global positioning systems (GPS), included ones used by the military. This pushed it into bankruptcy in May 2012. It has since reached agreements with some of the GPS makers. Financial advisers for Ligado pegged the company’s spectrum as worth between $4.5 billion and $6.8 billion during the bankruptcy, based on a certain method of valuing that type of asset, according to bankruptcy court papers.

504, ,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber offences. The charges came amid a swirl of controversies relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of U.S. President Donald Trump. This has given rise to uncertainty about whether Trump is willing to respond forcefully to any action by Moscow in cyberspace and elsewhere. The 47-count Justice Department indictment included charges of conspiracy, computer fraud and abuse, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. It painted a picture of the Russian security services working hand-in-hand with cyber criminals, who helped spies further their intelligence goals in exchange for using the same exploits to make money. “The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI’s point of contact in Moscow on cyber crime matters, is beyond the pale,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord said at a press conference announcing the charges. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) is the successor to the KGB. The Kremlin, which denies Russia tried to influence the U.S. election in any way, said on Thursday Moscow had received no official notification of the indictment, but hoped it would. However, Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, dismissed out of hand the idea that FSB employees could have been involved in the Yahoo hack. “We have said repeatedly that there can be no discussion of any official involvement of any Russian agency, including the FSB...in any unlawful cyber activities,” said Peskov, who has cast U.S. allegations against Russia as part of a political campaign to kill off a U.S.-Russia rapprochement. Yahoo said when it announced the then-unprecedented breach last September that it believed the attack was state-sponsored, and on Wednesday the company said the indictment “unequivocally shows” that to be the case. The charges announced Wednesday are not related to the hacking of Democratic Party emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have said they were carried out by Russian spy services, including the FSB, to help the campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump. The indictment named the FSB officers involved as Dmitry Dokuchaev and his superior, Igor Sushchin, who are both in Russia. Dokuchaev was arrested for treason in December, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. Reuters sent a request for comment to the FSB in Moscow on Wednesday evening but there was no response. The alleged criminals involved in the scheme include Alexsey Belan, who is among the FBI’s most-wanted cyber criminals and was arrested in Europe in June 2013 but escaped to Russia before he could be extradited to the United States, according to the Justice Department. Karim Baratov, who was born in Kazakhstan but has Canadian citizenship, was also named in the indictment. The Justice Department said Baratov was arrested in Canada on Tuesday. Mark Pugash of Toronto police later confirmed the Tuesday arrest. McCord said the hacking campaign was waged by the FSB to collect intelligence but that the two hackers used the collected information as an opportunity to “line their pockets.” The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, but McCord said she was hopeful Russian authorities would cooperate in bringing criminals to justice. The United States often charges cyber criminals with the intent of deterring future state-sponsored activity. The administration of former President Barack Obama brought similar charges against Chinese and Iranian hackers who have not been extradited. In a statement, White House spokesman Michael Anton said the charges “are part of a broad effort across the government to defend the United States against cyber attacks and cyber-related crimes.” Yahoo in December announced another breach that occurred in 2013 affecting one billion accounts. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI’s San Francisco Division said the 2013 breach is unrelated and that an investigation of that incident is ongoing. At least 30 million of the Yahoo accounts in the 2014 breach were the most seriously affected, with Belan able to burrow deep into their accounts and take user contact lists that were later used for a financially motivated spam campaign, according to the indictment. Belan also stole financial information such as credit card numbers and gift cards, it said. Yahoo had previously said about 32 million accounts had fallen victim to the deeper attack, which it said leveraged forged browser cookies to access accounts without the need for a password. According to the indictment, FSB officers Sushchin and Dokuchaev also directed Baratov to use the information gained in the Yahoo breach to hack specific targets who possessed email accounts with other service providers, including Google. When Baratov was successful, Dokuchaev would reward him with a bounty, the indictment charged. Examples where Google accounts were targeted include an assistant to the deputy chairman of the Russian Federation, an officer of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and a physical training expert employed by the Russian government. Details in the indictment reflect the often murky relationship in Russia between criminal hackers and government intelligence officers. Interpol issued a “red notice” on Belan in relation to an earlier hacking campaign, according to the indictment. Instead of arresting Belan, however, the FSB recruited him to help with cyber espionage and provided tools to evade detection from other authorities. Belan later gained unauthorized access to Yahoo’s network that he shared with FSB, the indictment said. ","

(VZ) is complete in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, naming the new CEO and disclosing the value of outgoing CEO Marissa Mayer’s golden parachute. As previously announced, the new company will be named Altaba, which is a play on the word alternate combined with the name Alibaba, as the remaining venture will encompass Yahoo's foreign assets, which includes a stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Holding Group Inc. (BABA) and Yahoo Japan. Altaba will be left with a 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan and a 15% stake in Alibaba, as well as a portfolio of patents under the Excalibur name. Leading the new company, which in essence becomes a holding company for the investments, is Yahoo board member Thomas McInerney. McInerney, formerly the chief financial officer for IAC/InterActiveCorp., has been a board member since 2012 and sat on the independent board committee charged with selling Yahoo’s core internet assets. McInerney will get base salary of $2 million annually and incentive pay based on performance goals. Yahoo also disclosed in the filing that outgoing CEO Mayer will get $23 million once the deal is closed and will not play a role in the new standalone company. It's not clear if she will have a role at Verizon once the deal is complete. Her golden parachute includes close to $3.02 million in cash and roughly $20 million from restricted stock units. Yahoo said in the filing the $23 million doesn’t include close to 2.9 million vested stock options worth $56.8 million. In the same filing, Yahoo, which had been renegotiating its deal with Verizon ever since it disclosed two massive data hacks that may have impacted more than 1 billion user accounts, said Verizon had wanted a $925 million reduction in the price tag and that the deal will close during the second quarter of 2017. In late February, the two sides agreed to reduce the sale price by $350 million and to share in any legal liabilities that come from Yahoo’s data breaches. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) In September, Yahoo disclosed the first of two massive breaches, revealing that a ""state-sponsored acto""r stole information from as many as 500 million user accounts. Yahoo said the stolen information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and hashed passwords. That breach happened in 2014. In December, Yahoo disclosed another larger breach of potentially 1 billion user accounts. In that case, the breach occurred in 2013.

The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the agreement following the attacks. In early February, Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam told Yahoo director Tom McInerney a price reduction as high as $925 million could be appropriate, according to the filing. McInerney later told McAdam at a meeting in Verizon's New York offices that Yahoo's board was unwilling to agree to such a big discount. Verizon said in late February it had agreed to a purchase price of $4.48 billion, lowering its original offer by $350 million.

T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) new unlimited data plan, T-Mobile One, has caused a lot of changes in the wireless industry. Every major U.S. carrier has responded to the new plan's introduction last autumn. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) was the biggest holdout, but it finally started offering an unlimited data plan last month. The new plan from Verizon is priced slightly higher than T-Mobile's, but Verizon is promoting the strength of its network in order to justify the higher pricing. As T-Mobile's marketing campaigns had been targeting Verizon for charging overages, it's now forced to battle the big carriers on the basis of its network quality and pricing. That's one less area of attack for T-Mobile. Recently, T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter spoke at a Deutsche Bank conference and talked about how Verizon's new plan impacted the Un-Carrier. Image source: Verizon T-Mobile has consistently seen a net add in subscribers against all three of its major competitors for the last several years. The company regularly reports its porting ratios -- the number of customers that switch to T-Mobile vs those switching from it -- with each of the wireless carriers every quarter. Prior to the introduction of Verizon's unlimited plan, T-Mobile's porting ratio with Verizon was the highest ever in the first quarter -- around 3 to 1, according to Carter. After Verizon launched its unlimited offering, ""For four days we went slightly negative. You know, in the 0.9. I think one day it was in the 0.8's,"" Carter said. ""On the fifth day, it started getting back up into positive territory."" Porting ratios have improved every week since. In the first week of March, Carter reported porting ratios around 1.5. Last week, that climbed into the 2-to-1 range. In the first quarter last year, T-Mobile posted a 1.34 porting ratio with Verizon. Even with a few tough weeks, T-Mobile may still be able to post significantly higher porting ratios with Verizon, despite the competitor's best efforts. One of the biggest factors in T-Mobile's ability to add net subscribers every quarter is its ability to reduce churn -- the percentage of subscribers canceling every month. From 2013 to 2016, churn fell from 1.69% to 1.30%. Last year, T-Mobile climbed to the top of Nielsen Mobile Inisghts' customer satisfaction survey. So, when Verizon launched its unlimited plan, fewer T-Mobile subscribers were actually looking to switch. The biggest factor increasing customer loyalty is T-Mobile's various Un-carrier initiatives. Its latest move centered around pricing. Not only did T-Mobile start including taxes and fees in its advertised pricing, it's giving customers the option to keep their pricing the same for the life of their relationship with the wireless carrier. Some customers don't want to risk trying Verizon and then being unable to return to their current T-Mobile plan at their current pricing. Meanwhile, T-Mobile is giving potential customers every reason to switch and lock in its best pricing. T-Mobile is running a promotional offer for two unlimited lines for $100 per month following the introduction of Verizon's unlimited plan. Earlier this month, customers could have gotten a third line free. Again, the prices are good as long as customers keep the same plan. T-Mobile is making sure it offers the best value in wireless, so its customers have no reason to look elsewhere. From the downward trend in customer churn, it looks like it's working, even as the competition starts fighting back. ","
      
    How Has Verizon Unlimited Affected T-Mobile? -- The Motley Fool

Kline,3162017,Fool,3092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past three quarters, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) has produced disappointing results. In fact, since the company purchased Verizon's wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF), customer counts have steadily dropped for the internet and cable company. That $10.54 billion deal more or less doubled the size of the company, giving it not only, 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband subscribers, and 1.2 million FiOS video customers, but also the size needed to operate more efficiently. Parts of the deal have worked out, but Frontier has been bleeding subscribers for all three quarters since the purchase closed, losing 144,000 residential customers and 14,000 business subscribers in Q4 alone. The company's stated reason for that continued decline keeps changing. In Q2 and Q3, CEO Daniel McCarthy blamed suspended marketing efforts, due to the company's desire to solve problems for its existing customers before attracting new ones. In Q4, he said that getting rid of subscribers who had not been paying caused the drops. In the Q3 earnings release, McCarthy said he expected a return to normal, and the company wrote that it ""anticipates improved customer additions in the fourth quarter."" In the Q4 release, McCarthy talked about dropping non-paying customers, something that had not been mentioned in previous releases or earnings calls. ""Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by our intensified efforts to resolve acquired accounts in California, Texas and Florida that we have determined to be non-paying,"" he said, promising that improvements would come. ""This process is almost complete, and we expect to return to a normalized trend by the start of the second quarter."" Aside from losing subscribers though, McCarthy and Frontier are doing many things right. But this doesn't mean investors should ignore this glaring problem. Frontier has lost cable, along with broadband customers. Image source: Frontier. The company knows how to be efficient. One of the goals of the Verizon purchase was to allow the company to spread its expenses out over more customers, and lower its overall operating costs. That part of the deal has worked out perfectly. ""We now expect annualized cost synergies of $1.6 billion to be achieved by mid-year 2018, up from the $1.4 billion target outlined in the 2016 third quarter earnings report, and a full year earlier than anticipated,"" McCarthy said in the Q4 earnings release. ""We expect $1.25 billion of the $1.6 billion in synergies will be achieved by the end of the first quarter of 2017, which is a quarter earlier than previously announced."" The second thing Frontier does well is manage its financial obligations. Despite the large debt the company incurred buying the CTF properties, its lenders clearly believe it will eventually get things back on track. In Q4, the company announced that it had amended its revolving credit agreements, including a term loan due in 2021, merging them into a single agreement. That new deal not only simplified things, it also pushed the 2021 obligation back to 2022 and extended the term of its revolving credit line from 2018 to 2022. ""These amendments significantly improve and solidify Frontier's finance picture, and provide us with additional flexibility as we transition to normalized operations in the acquired CTF properties over the coming quarters,"" said CFO Perley McBride in the Q4 earnings release. Being well-managed only will get Frontier so far. Cutting expenses and convincing creditors to give you longer terms only works if, at some point, the company stops losing subscribers, and turns its loss into profit. Frontier lost $587 million in 2016, almost twice the $316 million it lost the previous year. That loss comes despite all the savings the company has managed to deliver in operating expenses because of the expanded size it gained in the Verizon CTF deal. If the company has any hopes of a future, its CEO needs to stop finding excuses for losing customers, and show that Frontier can stabilize, and eventually return to growth. ","

Both Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Sprint (NYSE:S) have dealt with their fair share of problems in the past few quarters. Frontier has been steadily shedding the customers it paid Verizon (NYSE:VZ) $10.54 billion to acquire in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). Since completing that purchase, the cable and internet company has had three quarters where it reported losses not just in cable customers (which would match industry trends) but also in broadband (where its rivals have been gaining). Sprint has not had the same steadily downward trajectory -- it gained customers in its most-recently reported quarter -- but it has fallen into fourth place among the four major wireless carriers. The company has struggled to find an identity or a marketing strategy, and it has been greatly overshadowed by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which has positioned itself as the consumer-friendly wireless company. These are, as you can see on the chart below, two stocks going in opposite directions. Shareholders clearly like some of what Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure has done, while investors have not liked Frontier CEO Daniel McCarthy's quarterly promises that the customer base will stabilize only for it to keep dropping. Sprint has the needle pointing up, while Frontier does not, but both companies have growth potential. Frontier, in fact, may even have a very simple path to a stock price turnaround. Image source: YCharts. Frontier has seen subscriber drops in each of the last three quarters. In Q4, the company lost 144,000 residential customers. It also saw 14,000 business customers leave, and average revenue per user (ARPU) fell in both categories. McCarthy has attempted to explain that away, saying in Q2 and Q3 that the declines were due to problems related to the cutover, then saying in Q4 that the drops were due to a one-time problem with non-paying customers. The CEO has also been relentless in explaining why, aside from the subscribe loss issue, Frontier has been meeting its goals. ""During the quarter we made significant progress in positioning our company to deliver a better customer experience and improved financial performance, with greater financial flexibility,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release. ""We now expect annualized cost synergies of $1.6 billion to be achieved by mid-year 2018, up from the $1.4 billion target outlined in the 2016 third quarter earnings report, and a full year earlier than anticipated."" Frontier has largely achieved the synergies it said it would from buying the CTF properties. If it can stabilize and eventually grow its subscriber base, not only will its share price grow, but its attractiveness as an acquisition target will improve. Sprint has been using Verizon's former ""Can You Hear Me Now"" guy in its ads. Image source: Sprint. While the company has faltered in recent years, it seems to be moving in the right direction now. Sprint added 368,000 net postpaid subscribers in Q4, its highest total in four years, according to the company. The wireless carrier also has nine straight quarters of growth in that metric, and it has grown revenue for two straight quarters. The negative, and it's a big one, is that the company had a net loss of $479 million in Q3. However, the company has cut annual expenses by $1.6 billion year to date, and it has also seen its scores rise on the well-regarded RootMetrics wireless network quality report for the second half of 2016. ""Sprint is turning the corner,"" said Claure in the earnings release, continuing: Even with all the aggressive promotional offers from our competitors, we were still able to add more postpaid phone customers than both Verizon and AT&T while continuing to grow revenues, take costs out of the business, and improve the network. Sprint has performed admirably, but some of that success has been priced into its stock price. Conversely, Frontier has underperformed, and its shares have tanked accordingly. Going forward, Sprint faces a tougher path. It's not the innovator in its space -- that's T-Mobile -- nor is it the company with the best network (that's Verizon, according to RootMetrics, with T-Mobile tying for first in another leading study). In some cases, Sprint is the cheapest, and that has helped its growth, but there are obvious drawbacks to the strategy of lowering prices to get customers when after the low-cost deal expires, it's relatively easy for them to leave. Both of these companies face tough roads in competitive markets. However, Sprint has already begun its recovery, and it's more likely to hit roadblocks than it is to go steadily upward. Frontier is currently a bargain as long as you believe McCarthy when he says the company will reverse its subscriber losses. If the company can do that when it reports on Q1 in roughly three months, it should see a decent uptick, making it the better buy. ","

With interest rates still at historically low levels in most developed economies, the hunt for yield can be a challenging endeavor for investors. Fortunately, there are some high-quality businesses that currently offer dividend yields of more than 3% -- a sizable bounty in a world where interest rates paid by bank deposit accounts and short-term government bonds are often measured in basis points. In this regard, here are two excellent high-yield stocks worthy of your consideration. Image source: Anheuser-Busch InBev. In the world of beer, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) is as dominant as they come. After its recent $100 billion acquisition of its former No. 1 competitor, SABMiller, AB InBev now commands nearly 30% of the global beer market. The combined company has a portfolio of more than 500 beers, including seven of the top 10 global beer brands and 18 brands that generate more than $1 billion in retail sales. AB InBev is now the world's first truly global brewer with operations in virtually every major beer market. And while growth in beer consumption has recently been sluggish in developed markets such as the U.S., the merger with SABMiller gives AB InBev a stronger position in high-growth developing regions, particularly in Africa. AB In Bev has also been snatching up craft beer brands to expand its presence in this fast-growing segment of the massive U.S. market. Although this is still a small portion of its business, it makes the craft beer craze less of a threat than the bears would have you believe. In fact, higher-priced craft beer has made it easier for AB InBev to raise prices for its popular macrobrews, which has helped the company's revenue growth outstrip volume growth in recent years. But where the beer king really excels is in wringing profits out of each beer it sells. 3G Capital -- the Brazilian group that runs AB InBev -- has a strong track record of helping acquired businesses slash costs and boost profits, and investors should expect more of the same in the coming years. In fact, in its fourth-quarter earnings release, management increased its guidance for synergies and cost savings related to the SABMiller merger to $2.8 billion, up from previous estimates of $2.45 billion. The company has already delivered on more than $800 million of that goal, and it expects to realize the remaining $2 billion over the next three to four years. During that time, management will be (wisely) prioritizing debt repayment, so AB InBev's dividend increases may be modest for the next few years. But its current yield is already sizable, at 3.6%, and the dividend should be well secured by the more than $20 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) the company expects to achieve once SABMiller is fully integrated. Even better, with its shares down about 20% from their 52-week highs due largely to some macroeconomic related -- and likely short-term -- struggles in Brazil, AB InBev's stock is currently trading at about 24 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2017 and 21 times 2018's estimates. That's quite a bargain for such a dominant company that's expected to grow earnings by more than 24% over the next half decade. As such, investors may wish to consider taking a sip of AB In-Bev stock today. Like AB InBev, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offers investors the potential for solid income generation and capital appreciation. The telecom giant's subscription-based, utility-like business generates strong and stable cash flow that it's then able to pass on to shareholders in the form of a steadily rising -- and currently 4.7% -- cash dividend stream. VZ data by YCharts. Verizon's wireless network consistently ranks as the best in the industry, even as rivals such as T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) claim that they're chipping away at Verizon's lead. That ha helped Verizon continue to add postpaid wireless subscribers -- who are generally the most profitable and sought-after customers -- despite heavy promotions from T-Mobile, Sprint, and other competitors. Moreover, after largely ignoring the competition's heavy promotions and competing almost solely on the reputation of its best-in-class wireless network, Verizon has recently moved to meet its challengers head on. The company announced an unlimited data plan that's likely to prove popular with consumers and that could win some customers away from its rivals. At the very least, it should help to preserve Verizon's high customer retention. Verizon is also making moves to diversify its revenue streams. One exciting area of focus is the Internet of Things space, where Verizon is acquiring assets to strengthen its technology and service offerings. The company's IoT ambitions appear promising, with revenue growth from Verizon's IoT services rising 21% year over year on a comparable basis -- and 60% when including acquisitions -- to $243 million in the fourth quarter. Although the business is currently small (by Verizon's standards), the massive potential of the Internet of Things could help this segment grow to become a significant portion of Verizon's revenue and profits in the years ahead. Verizon is also rumored to be considering beefing up its pay-TV assets. Cable giant Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is one company that's rumored to be a potential acquisition target, but I'd rather see Verizon snatch up Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH). With a market cap of less than $30 billion (compared to nearly $87 billion for Charter), Dish would be much less expensive and likely easier to integrate. Dish's popular Sling TV product is a gem that could help Verizon advance its beachhead in the rapidly growing Internet TV market and expand its popular ""skinny bundle"" offerings. Moreover, obtaining Dish Network's valuable spectrum as part of the deal would be an added sweetener for Verizon. Regardless of whether any of these rumored acquisitions come to fruition, Verizon's core wireless business -- and more than $40 billion in annual EBITDA -- should allow the telecom titan to continue to do what it has done consistently over the past decade: reward its shareholders with steadily growing dividend income. And with its stock trading at only about 12 times forward earnings -- a significant discount to the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18 -- investors can buy this dividend dynamo at a fantastic price today.

    2 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 3% -- The Motley Fool

518,Leo Sun,3162017,Fool,3092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of AT&T (NYSE:T) recently hit a 16-year high, but that rally has raised concerns that the market is too optimistic about this slow growth stock. The bears note that AT&T's sluggish growth in postpaid wireless customers, the return of unlimited data plans, its elevated debt levels, and uncertainties regarding its proposed buyout of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) could all make the stock a risky bet. While investors should certainly take note of those headwinds, I believe that AT&T remains a solid long-term play for most investors for four simple reasons. AT&T's flagship store in San Francisco. Image source: AT&T. Many investors, including myself, own AT&T for its dividend. The company has raised its dividend annually for over three decades, making it an elite ""dividend aristocrat"" which has hiked its payout annually for over 25 years. AT&T's 4.6% dividend makes it the highest paying income stock in that elite group. Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) 4.7% yield is slightly higher, but it's only raised its dividend annually for ten straight years. AT&T has a payout ratio of 92%, meaning that it spent that percentage of its earnings on dividends over the past 12 months. AT&T's dividend will remain rock solid as long as that percentage remains below 100%. Even if that ratio briefly rises about 100%, AT&T will likely fund the dividends out of it own pockets to retain its ""aristocrat"" title. Over the past few years, many blue chip dividend stocks climbed to historical highs as their valuations rose, meaning their yields dropped to historical lows. Some analysts attributed that shift to low interest rates making bonds look less attractive than dividend stocks. As interest rates rise, those investors may sell their overvalued dividend stocks in exchange for the fixed income security of bonds. I might be worried if AT&T traded at historically high multiples, but that's not the case. Its P/E of 20 remains much lower than its industry average of 25, as well as the mid-30s it reached in late 2015. Analysts expect AT&T to grow its annual earnings at an average rate of 8% over the next five years, giving it a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.8. That isn't below a ratio of 1 -- which would be considered ""cheap"" -- but it's much lower than Verizon's PEG ratio of 6.6, which is calculated from its estimated 5-year annual growth rate of just 2%. Some investors assume that AT&T's ""wireless"" business only refers to the smartphone market, which is slowing down due to competition and the saturation of the North American market. But that business is still growing -- AT&T added 9.5 million wireless customers (6.2 million in the U.S. and 3.3 million in Mexico) in fiscal 2016, which boosted its North American mobile customer base to 147 million. To reduce its dependence on smartphones, AT&T has expanded its wireless ecosystem to include connected wearables, drones, Internet of Things gadgets, and connected cars. The connected car market remains a major growth market for AT&T. Last January, it announced that it would connect up to 10 million Ford vehicles in North America by 2020. A month later, it tested the world's first LTE-connected drones with Intel. AT&T is adding these devices to its multi-device plans, which could increase its revenue per customer while widening its competitive moat. Intel and AT&T's test drone for LTE networks. Image source: Intel. Lastly, AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner will likely be approved, because the FCC -- which the Trump Administration reportedly pushed to block the deal -- isn't overseeing the regulatory review. That's because AT&T and Time Warner structured the deal in a way which avoids the transfer of any FCC licenses. Meanwhile, the Republican-led FTC recently ruled that AT&T and Verizon's ""zero-rated"" sponsored videos (which don't count toward data caps) didn't violate net neutrality -- indicating that regulators could retain a soft stance toward the megamerger. AT&T may need to make some concessions to clear the regulatory hurdles, but the acquisition could enable AT&T to build a zero-rated video ecosystem -- greatly strengthened by Time Warner's media portfolio -- on top of its own wireless networks. When AT&T links that ecosystem to DirecTV, it will control both the content and the pipes in a way that could be tough for rivals like Netflix and Verizon to counter. AT&T is currently my biggest stock holding and accounts for nearly 7% of my portfolio, so I'm confident in the telco's long-term prospects. The company certainly faces near-term headwinds, but I believe that its dividend, valuations, and the expansion of its ecosystem still make it a solid play for conservative income investors.

    Why AT&T, Inc. Shareholders Have Nothing to Worry About -- The Motley Fool

519,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",3162017,Fool,3092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend-paying stocks as a group tend to hold up better during recessions and market crashes than their non-dividend counterparts, and tend to perform better over long periods of time. Since choosing individual stocks isn't right for everyone, there are some solid exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, investors can use to get dividend stock exposure in their portfolios. Two high-paying options are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund (NYSEMKT:DHS), so here's a look at the similarities and differences between them. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which currently includes 412 stocks with above-average dividend yields, and specifically excludes real estate investment trusts (REITs). As of this writing, the fund pays a 2.8% dividend yield. Image Source: Getty Images. As I mentioned, the fund has more than 400 stocks in its portfolio, but it is somewhat ""top heavy"", meaning that the fund's largest holdings make up a large portion of its assets. In fact, the 10 largest stock holdings account for nearly one-third of the Vanguard fund's assets. Here's a breakdown of the fund's 10 largest positions, and how much each one accounts for: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets Microsoft 2.43% 5.4% ExxonMobil 3.62% 3.8% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.4% JPMorgan Chase 2.09% 3.4% Wells Fargo 2.59% 3.1% General Electric 3.20% 2.9% AT&T 4.67% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.6% Chevron 3.82% 2.3% Verizon Communications 4.62% 2.2% Source: Vanguard. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. The Vanguard High Dividend ETF has $25 billion in assets under management, and has a rock-bottom 0.08% expense ratio. This means that on a $10,000 investment, the annual fees and fund expenses you'll pay are just $8. The WisdomTree High Dividend Fund has a similar objective as the Vanguard product. It aims to track the performance of the WisdomTree High Dividend Index, a proprietary index of high-dividend U.S. companies that contains 439 stocks as I write this, just slightly more than the Vanguard fund's underlying index. The WisdomTree fund is significantly smaller, with just $1.3 billion in assets under management and a 0.38% expense ratio. Currently, the fund's dividend yield is about 3.2%. And just like the Vanguard fund, the WisdomTree High Dividend Fund's 10 largest holdings account for about one-third of the fund's assets, although the composition is different: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets AT&T 4.67% 4.6% ExxonMobil 3.62% 4.2% Johnson & Johnson 2.59% 3.5% Verizon Communications 4.62% 3.3% Chevron 3.82% 2.9% Pfizer 3.73% 2.9% Philip Morris 3.79% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 2.96% 2.9% Wells Fargo 2.59% 2.8% General Electric 3.20% 2.8% Source: WisdomTree. Dividend yields are current as of 3/7/17. As you can see, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two. There are eight stocks that are on both top-10 lists. While these funds are similar in many ways, there are a couple of key differences worth mentioning. The Vanguard fund has a significantly lower expense ratio (0.08% vs. 0.38%). Although I wouldn't call either fund's expense ratio excessive, Vanguard's is clearly the lower-cost option. This may seem like a small difference, but it can really add up over a period of several decades. On the other hand, the Vanguard fund specifically excludes REITs, while they are a big part of the WisdomTree Fund's underlying index. I've written many times about the long-term growth power of REITs, so for an investor like me, this can be a big plus. As of this writing, about 12% of the WisdomTree fund's assets are invested in the real estate sector, which could account for its slightly higher dividend yield. In terms of strategy and diversification, these funds are quite similar, even down to the number of stocks each one invests in and the respective dividend yields of each. However, the Vanguard fund is cheaper and the WisdomTree fund includes the real estate sector. While it's difficult to call one of these a better fund product than the other, the cost advantage of the Vanguard High Dividend ETF is the deciding factor for me. However, I have ample REIT exposure elsewhere in my portfolio -- if I didn't, I may be more willing to pay the WisdomTree fund's higher expense ratio. ","

You picked an internet provider. The hard part is over, right? Well, almost. After you select your speed — and your bundle, if you go that route — you need to make one last decision: Rent a modem and router from your provider or buy your own. Running the numbers makes the decision easy. You need a modem for your internet to work. If you want Wi-Fi, you’ll need a router, too. Internet providers typically charge $10 to $15 a month to lease an all-in-one modem and router. So, over two years, you’ll pay $240 to $360 for your modem-router combo. But you can purchase your own modem and router, separately or in a combo unit, for less than the cost of renting.

                                   Cable or Cox Communications. Most tech experts suggest opting for a separate modem and router over a combo unit. The reason: You can get more out of your router — features, settings and power — if it’s a stand-alone unit. Buying your modem and router will save you money in the long run, but there are a few scenarios in which renting makes sense. You have roommates. Splitting the cost of a modem and router is easy. Figuring out how to divvy up the device should one or more roommates move out — not so much. Unless you can settle on a system that works for everyone, renting and splitting the bill will likely save headaches down the road. Your employer foots the bill. Some lucky folks don’t pay for their internet service. Instead, their company pays the monthly bill. They may not pay for equipment, though. If that’s you, don’t dig into your wallet for a new modem. You’re moving soon. If your living situation is temporary, renting might make the most sense. Especially if you don’t know where you’ll land next and what your internet options will be when you get there. That said, if you know those things, you might be able to buy equipment that will work when you settle into more permanent digs. If you’re particularly tech averse, you may also be inclined to rent, since your internet provider may offer free troubleshooting and repair services only on modems leased or purchased through it. Just keep in mind that most modems and routers are easy to set up and require little to no fiddling once they’re up and running. Routers are universal and can be used with any internet service provider. Modems are a slightly different story. First, you need to make sure the modem’s compatible with your internet provider. Most carriers have a list of approved modems on their website and many major providers allow the same devices. So you can often keep your modem if you switch providers, as long as it’s the same type of internet service (cable, DSL or fiber). Some providers, like Verizon Fios, don’t let customers use their own equipment. But Fios customers can opt to buy their modem directly from Verizon,

                                   an option that will save you roughly $90 over two years compared with renting. The next step: Make sure the modem has staying power. This rule applies even if you’re buying it directly from your provider. Internet speeds are only getting faster and older modems — those with DOCSIS 2.0 technology — top out at 38 Mbps download speeds. If you’re paying for internet speeds of 30 Mbps or higher, or think you might in the future, spring for a model with DOCSIS 3.0 technology. These support speeds up to 150 Mbps, which is plenty fast for even the most connected families. Once you’ve settled on a compatible modem, consider buying a used or refurbished model. You’ll save even more money and lose little to nothing in terms of performance. Just make sure you’re clear on the return policy should you have any issues. Buying a modem and router will increase your upfront costs, but lower your monthly internet bill. Most tech experts suggest buying separate devices, but a combo unit will get the job done if you’re trying to keep things simple. Either way, you’ll save money in the long run.

522,,3232017,Reuters,3162017,"The vote was along party lines, with 50 Republicans approving the measure and 48 Democrats rejecting it. The two remaining Republicans in the Senate were absent and did not cast a vote. According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that “makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.” But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote “creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.” The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a “critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.” Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote “is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.” ","

523,,3232017,Reuters,3162017,"(Reuters) - The decision by a handful of high-profile consumer brands to pull advertising from Google’s YouTube over offensive content could threaten the site’s long-term strategy of stealing ad dollars from television, analysts and ad industry professionals said Thursday. The immediate financial impact of the controversy is likely to be limited, in part because a big chunk of YouTube revenue comes from smaller advertisers who lack the budget for TV campaigns and do not have easy alternatives. Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube’s millennial audience, will quickly return. But with “brand safety” emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious. The timing may also favor television networks as they usually present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers starting in May, agency executives said. “Video is actually a lot more fragile of an ecosystem than the Silicon Valley, software-eats-everything crowd may want to think,” said Joel Espelien, a senior analyst at the Diffusion Group, which studies the future of television. “The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3 percent since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google’s elaborate ad-serving systems. “We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match,” Schmidt said. “We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google’s public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for media buying firm Magna Global. Privately, Google has gone into more detail about how it plans to combat the issue, including ratcheting up its algorithms to better categorize content and being more stringent about how content is labeled, Cohen said. But such additional controls would reduce the percentage of content that carries advertising and could disrupt the vibrant community of independent creators on YouTube, who drive traffic to the site and rely on revenue-sharing from advertising. “YouTube has a decade-long head start, but obviously everyone wants a piece of the pie,” he said. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

It's been more than two years since Sprint (NYSE:S) and its parent company, Softbank, ended their merger pursuit of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), after regulators indicated that they would block such a deal. Since then, rumors have continued to pop up that Sprint is still interested in T-Mobile, and the self-proclaimed un-carrier has indicated that it's open to merger talks. When asked whether T-Mobile would be interested in any type of ""convergence"" with a wireless or cable company at the Deutsche Bank investor conference earlier this month, T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter said: ""I really think it's a question of when, and not if. There are significant benefits that we'll see with convergence. Both from a wireless carrier standpoint as well as a broadband cable standpoint."" But it's becoming increasingly clear that T-Mobile would prefer merging with a cable provider, rather than entertain another proposal from a wireless rival. Image source: T-Mobile. Carter mentioned that when cable and wireless providers are integrated, then companies are able to better understand their individual customers. He said that it could ""provide amazing monetization opportunities."" Reports have surfaced that Softbank would cede control of Sprint if a merger with T-Mobile were to go through, but that might not be enough to entice the wireless carrier into another potential regulation quagmire. ""The true career people inside of these agencies don't really change,"" Carter said at the conference. ""The precedents, the tool sets, the type of analysis that they do doesn't really change."" In short, Carter believes that it may not be worth pursuing a consolidation of the U.S. wireless carriers based on its past experiences. T-Mobile's skittishness is understandable when you consider that not only did the 2014 deal fall apart because of regulators, but an earlier proposal from AT&T in 2011 was also thwarted by the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice because the agencies believed that going from four major carriers to three would reduce competition. T-Mobile's CFO indicated that he strongly believes another merger attempt between his company and a wireless provider wouldn't end well. ""While the odds certainly have potentially increased, I don't think it's the least bit probable with high likelihood that you could actually transact, given some of the precedents that are out there,"" Carter said."" Instead, T-Mobile appears to be building the case that its position in providing end-to-end mobility across the entire country would be a perfect fit for a cable provider looking to expand beyond its regional footprint. T-Mobile has expanded its wireless business at a breakneck pace over the past few years, which could make it an even more desirable merger partner. The company added 8.2 million net customer subscribers in 2016 -- marking its third year of 8 million or more net adds -- and is on track to match rival Verizon Communications' 320 million LTE points-of-presence (POPs) coverage by the end of this year. Carter said that cable companies will never be able to deliver truly ubiquitous video content because of their limitation in specific geographical markets, and a wireless merger could fix that. ""And I think that's why, eventually, we'll get to the point where convergence will become a reality,"" he said. The current merger landscape may bode well for T-Mobile, too. AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to acquire Time Warner valued the cable giant at a 35% premium on its stock price before the deal was announced. Of course, there's no guarantee that T-Mobile cold fetch as high of a premium in a merger deal. But T-Mobile's valuation has risen since Sprint first pursued the company, from about $30 billion to its current $51 billion market cap. That puts T-Mobile in a much stronger position to negotiate. And with its current customer growth and strong network presence, there's no reason why T-Mobile would have to settle for a subpar proposal from any potential merger partners. ","

533,Daniel B. Kline,3232017,Fool,3162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In the wireless space, customer loyalty matters, because retaining a customer costs essentially nothing while luring a new one in involves incentives, paying off phone installment contracts, and sometimes offering lower pricing. That's especially true in a mature wireless market. In the United States, cell-phone adoption moved over 90% in 2013, and it inched higher to 92% in 2015, according to data from the Pew Research Center. That means nearly everyone who wants a wireless phone or smartphone already has one. For carriers, that means the only source of new customers in any significant amount is other carriers. It's an industry where the competition for customers is fierce and loyal customers are especially valuable now that consumers can switch providers easily, without losing their number. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) remain the two biggest carriers, followed by T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S). When it comes to loyalty, however, the Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) shows a clear winner -- AT&T. Wireless carriers are competing against each for customers. Image source: Getty Images. In markets where consumers believe all brands are equal, then the cheapest or sometimes the most convenient one tends to win the most customers. For example, while some consumers have loyalty to gasoline brands, many don't. That means a lot of people buy gas at the most convenient station or the one with the best price, and sometimes a combination of those two things. The same could be said for a lot of products, but even when two items are similar or even identical, brand loyalty can not only get a customer to buy a certain item, but it can also have that person pay more for it. It's not always a conscious decision. Many of us buy a certain brand of eggs, milk, or cereal out of loyalty (and habit) when a store brand would in many cases be just as good, as well as cheaper. In wireless, AT&T and Verizon, which took second place on the CLEI in wireless, have built a reputation for having better networks than T-Mobile and Sprint, which came in third and fourth, respectively. Those loyalty numbers from Brand Keys also match a key industry metric. Both AT&T, the largest carrier, and Verizon have markedly lower churn rates than Sprint and T-Mobile. In Q3 2016, Verizon posted a 1.26% churn rate -- that is, customers who left the carrier -- while AT&T came in at 1.45%, T-Mobile had 2.27%, and Sprint was fourth with 2.78%. The numbers vary a little from quarter to quarter, but going back all the way to Q1 2013, AT&T and Verizon consistently have lower churn rates than their rivals. That's important, because in recent years, both T-Mobile and Sprint have not only been cheaper than AT&T and Verizon, but they have also pushed unlimited data, which consumers seem to really like. It's only in 2017 that Verizon added unlimited plans and AT&T opened up its unlimited plans to all customers, not just those who also bundled its DirecTV service. CLEI winner AT&T and runner-up Verizon have loyal customer bases, but both companies clearly realize that loyalty only goes so far. T-Mobile has changed the industry, and the top two carriers have had to make changes to respond, such as dropping contracts, offering unlimited plans, and lessening (if not quite eliminating) overages. That has kept those two companies steady, but as T-Mobile CEO John Legere gleefully explained in his company's Q4 earnings release, the Un-carrier is catching up. ""The competition just doesn't get that customers want to come first,"" Legere said. ""That's three years in a row that we've added more than 8 million customers and taken all of the postpaid phone growth in the industry."" That sounds like bragging, and it certainly is, but Legere speaks the truth. His company has been gaining on AT&T and Verizon mostly by offering lower prices and more transparency. The numbers, however, would be a lot worse if more AT&T and Verizon customers were unhappy. The Brand Keys results, coupled with the churn-rate trends, show that they're content. Happy customers who think they're getting a better product, especially in a space where reliability matters such as wireless phones, mostly won't jump carriers just to save money. That doesn't mean AT&T and Verizon can rest on their laurels. T-Mobile and Sprint are cheaper, and Sprint specifically has dedicated a lot of advertising dollars to hammering home the idea that all wireless networks are pretty much equal. For many customers, that's more or less true (and one of the two leading industry studies ranks T-Mobile as tied for Verizon for the top network). Eventually, that could push loyal customers to make a change, but for now loyalty has helped protect AT&T and Verizon against two very aggressive competitors. ","

Moreover, management pointed the way toward continued growth across its portfolio. Let's dive in to some highlights. Image source: Ciena. Ciena prides itself on having invested early in an open platform with a diverse portfolio -- allowing its networking, data center, and web customers to pick from a variety of products, and add, alter, or drop network elements as necessary, and in a seamless fashion. In the company's 2016 annual report, CEO Gary Smith wrote: Five years ago, we introduced our OPn Architecture, a focused approach to next-generation networks through scalability, programmability and network level applications. Today, OPn has evolved and expanded into our governing philosophy and broader belief system, which is rooted in enabling choice in the market through openness. This bet appears to be paying off, as the company says it now has a leading position in many applications, such as data center interconnect, and multivendor network orchestration, which requires openness and flexibility. Basically, instead of locking its customers into a particular hardware regime, Ciena has invested in a diverse suite of technologies, and opened its technologies up to developers with its Emulation Cloud and DevOps Toolkit. The results seem to be excellent -- at least relative to the industry. Ciena cited recognition as an industry leader in several segments in its annual report. On the latest conference call, the company reiterated that it was growing faster than the market, and should continue to do so. The market, it forecast, is growing in the mid-single digits, so expect high-single-digit growth for Ciena. This appears to be true, especially when you compare Ciena's results to those of competitor Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN). Infinera had a terrible year, and its most recent quarter showed year-over-year growth of negative 30%, a stark contrast from Ciena's 8.4% gain. Ciena has been using its recent strength to take care of its balance sheet. The company reduced its convertible debt by $46 million in the quarter and its term loan by $93 million, though it still has a ways to go as it has $1.25 billion in debt and convertible notes. The company is not necessarily in any danger here -- cash and short-term and long-term investments topped $1 billion, so Ciena should have plenty of cash to pay off the $185 million that comes due in June 2017. Still, the company's ratio of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to interest expense in 2016 was only roughly 3, so interest expense is taking up a good chunk of potential earnings. Telecom equipment is not the most stable business, so debt reduction could go a long way in de-risking the company. The company grew its Asia-Pacific revenues nearly 60% year over year in the most recent quarter, despite not being in China. Its main growth driver in the Asia-Pacific region is India. As Smith explained on the call, there is a very large build for 4G capability going on in India right now, and Ciena is reaping the gains of seeds it's been sowing in the region for years (transcript via Seeking Alpha): ... this is an investment that we've made dating back 12 years, both in terms of software development teams and market development teams there. It is our fastest-growing country, and we are basically with every single major carrier in India and we are very well positioned for it. So I think it's a multiyear opportunity; it's not just one quick buildout that's getting all the attention, it's across the very broad base of technologies for Ciena. And really it's a market that I think will be very, very high growth for us over multiple years. The Asia Pacific region accounted for about 14% of revenue in the most recent quarter. While Ciena has performed very well in a cyclical, competitive market, it is about to lose a key executive. Francois Locoh-Donou has been with Ciena for almost 20 years, and is currently the company's chief operating officer. However, this year he will take over the reins as CEO of F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). Smith assured investors on the call that a succession plan was underway and the company has a very deep bench. Nevertheless, someone with the skills to be a CEO will surely be missed, so investors must watch how the company executes going forward. It appears as though Ciena is performing strongly in the market for optical networking gear. Nevertheless, it is losing its COO, and remains subject to the investment cycles of large telcos. AT&T and Verizon make up more than 27% of the company's revenue, so any further slowdown with those clients could be reason for caution. The company currently trades at 39 times earnings, though only 11 times forward estimates, so continued strong growth and increasing margins are built into the current price. Still, those who believe in a renewed cycle for optical networking spend may wish to give Ciena a look. ","

China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) is the biggest telecom company in the world and one of the three most valuable companies in Asia, but its stock is often overlooked by U.S. investors. The telco doesn't offer spectacular price growth, but it's a solid income play which rebounded from some steep market downturns since its IPO in late 1997. I personally own shares of China Mobile, and I think it's a great ""forever"" stock to own for ten simple reasons. Image source: Getty Images. Being the top telco in the world's most populated country naturally gives China Mobile the biggest customer base of any telecom company -- which includes 851 million wireless customers at the end of January, a 3% gain from 829 million customers a year earlier. Within that total, 552 million customers were on 4G networks -- a 65% jump from a year ago. That growth bodes well for China Mobile, since it generates much higher revenues per 4G customer than those on 2G and 3G networks. China Mobile launched a wireline broadband business at the beginning of 2016, and its subscriber base has grown 39% from 58 million last February to 81 million this January. That move might seem unusual, since U.S. telcos like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are eagerly divesting their slower-growth wireline businesses, but it's a smart way for China Mobile to reach more rural customers across the country. It also allows the company to expand its ecosystem and boost its revenue per customer with video, internet, and wireless bundles. China has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, according to Internet Live Stats. That's very low compared to an 89% penetration rate in the U.S. and 91% penetration rate in Japan. It also indicates that China Mobile has plenty of room to continue growing its wireless and wireline customer bases. In February, China Mobile, telecom equipment vendor ZTE, and mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced that they would start interoperability testing and outdoor trials for the new 5G specs developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) group. Those trials, which will run throughout 2017, will use China Mobile's guidelines, ZTE's base station solutions, and Qualcomm's prototype chips. China Mobile plans to start deployment testing in 2018 and start commercial operations in 2020 -- which should spark fresh revenue growth as 4G customers upgrade their plans. Image source: Getty Images. China Mobile is one of three state-backed telecom companies in China, the other two of which are China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU). The Chinese government occasionally rotates the management at these three companies to prevent one company from marginalizing the other two. That intervention prevents China Mobile from ever becoming a monopoly, but the government backing also gives it a wide safety net during market downturns. The tight relationship between the three telcos enables them to collaborate quickly. In late 2015, the three companies agreed to sell their towers to China Tower for cash and stock, then lease them back to reduce operating expenses. Analysts estimate that the move generated roughly 2.4 billion yuan ($350 million) in savings for China Mobile within the first year. China Mobile has a trailing yield of 3.2%, which admittedly doesn't look as impressive as AT&T and Verizon's 4.6% yields. Its semi-annual payments, which are declared every half year based on earnings growth, are also less frequent than AT&T and Verizon's quarterly payments. But despite those disadvantages, China Mobile has continuously paid dividends for 14 straight years, and its trailing yield has remained between 3% and 5% over the past five years -- which is much higher than the S&P 500's 2% yield. China Mobile's top line growth has slowed down since 2014, but that should just be a momentary lull before it adds more customers and generates more revenues per customer with 4G plans and wireline/wireless bundles. Source: YCharts. Analysts expect China Mobile's revenue to rise 2% this year and 4% next year. That growth rate might look weak, but it compares favorably to AT&T's estimates for 1% sales growth and Verizon's estimates for a 1% sales decline. Lastly, China Mobile trades at just 14 times earnings, which is higher than China Telecom's P/E of 12 but lower than China Unicom's P/E of 51 and the industry average of 18 for foreign telecom companies. That low valuation -- combined with its solid dividend, government backing, and growth opportunities across China -- make China Mobile one of the safest ways to invest in China's long-term growth. The stock may face near-term volatility due to alarmist talk about a trade war between the U.S. and China, but those challenges will likely fade over the next few years. ","

Defining the Internet of Things (IoT) can be simplified down to the connection of everyday things -- like homes, industrial equipment, watches, etc. -- to the internet, for the purpose of collecting data, tracking usage, and automating systems. While it encompasses many technological devices, it's important to remember that the Internet of Things spans across all major sectors. The amount of connected IoT objects will reach 50 billion by 2020 and will be worth $7.1 trillion by that same year. Now that you know a little more about what the IoT is, let's take a look at how companies are using the IoT right now, and a few IoT examples you might not know about. Image source: Getty Images. If you've ever seen an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch or an internet-connected Fitbit fitness tracker, then you're familiar with the Internet of Things. These devices fall into the broader wearable technology market and they're what many people think of when they think of the IoT. Or perhaps you've heard of a Nest programmable thermostat. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns Nest, which makes internet-connected thermostats that you can control via a smartphone or tablet, and learns your heating and cooling preferences the more you use it. Both Alphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also pushing the Internet of Things into homes with their smart home hubs, like Google Home and the Amazon Echo. Both devices use virtual assistants to answer questions, order things online, or connect to door locks, lights, and home security systems. Connected homes are a major part of the consumer side of the IoT, and will bring in $14 billion in revenue this year in the U.S. Smartwatches, internet-connected fitness trackers, and smart home connections are just a few examples of how companies are investing in the IoT. While there are lots of companies betting on the Internet of Things, here's a quick list of some of the biggest players. While much of the IoT may seem like it's focused on consumer devices, most of the growth with come from the enterprise market. Research from BI Intelligence shows that enterprise devices will account for 40% of all 23.3 billion IoT devices by 2019. Agricultural-equipment maker Deere & Company uses internet-connected field equipment, along with sensors, analytics software, and cloud services to track the efficiency of seed planting. This type of agricultural technology is transforming how food is grown and how farmers manage their fields and equipment. Many other non-tech companies are also jumping into the IoT as well. General Electric, the 125-year-old conglomerate, has developed its own analytics software for industrial equipment. GE uses its software to help its customers manage their equipment more efficiently and anticipate when it needs to be fixed. Scottish and Southern Energy uses GE's Reliability Management software to track its equipment and maintain uptime, which saves the company an estimated $3.6 million dollars every year. In order for more devices, equipment, and services to be added to the IoT, new and more sophisticated wireless networks are being developed. Verizon is at the forefront of this change and said last year that its upcoming 5G network will help address the IoT's network needs. Verizon will roll out pilot tests of its 5G network in 11 cities across the U.S. in the first half of this year. While there's often a lot of hype around new technologies, it's clear that companies are already taking the IoT seriously and finding ways to use connected devices and software to offer better products and services. And if this year is any indicator, it appears that now is one of the best times for investors to consider getting on board with this technological shift. ","

538,Sean Williams,3232017,Fool,3162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks are often the foundation on which the greatest investing and retirement portfolios are built. And there's a good reason for that: They present myriad advantages over companies that don't share a percentage of their profits with shareholders. To begin with, dividend stocks are often a beacon of profitability. Companies don't ordinarily share a percentage of their earnings with investors on a recurring basis if they don't believe those profits are sustainable. Thus, a dividend payment (and especially dividend growth over time) serves as something of fishing hook to lure in income-seeking investors. Image source: Getty Images. Second, dividend stocks can help hedge against the inevitable downward movements in the stock market. The broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) has had 35 corrections totaling at least 10% since 1950, when rounded to the nearest whole number. While dividend income is unlikely to completely eliminate the often short-term pain of a stock market correction, it certainly helps to alleviate some of the sting. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, dividend stocks allow shareholders to grow their wealth through a process known as compounding. Instead of simply pocketing a dividend payout, shareholders have the opportunity of repurchasing more shares of common stock through a dividend reinvestment plan, more commonly referred to as a DRIP. DRIPs usually have no commission attached, sometimes allow for fractional share purchases, and increase your stake of ownership such that you receive a bigger payout and thus more shares of stock, in a repeating pattern. It's a trick that some of the smartest money managers use for their clients to generate wealth. Generally speaking, income investors want to buy into companies with the highest yields possible. But dividend stocks also hold an ironic and somewhat dark truth: The higher the yield, the greater the risk for disappointment. Dividend yields are ultimately just a function of a company's share price. Dividend yields don't tell us a whole lot about the quality of the dividend (i.e., if it's sustainable) or the earnings power behind the dividend. If a company has a failing or struggling business model and its share price falls considerably, it could artificially inflate the dividend yield and make it appear far more tempting than it should be. In simpler terms, the higher the yield, the more likely you could be falling into a high-yield dividend trap. Are you chasing a high-yield dividend trap? Image source: Getty Images. Admittedly, not all high-yield dividend stocks are necessarily bad news. The corporate structure of real estate investment trusts (REITs) ensures that they pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of a dividend in order to qualify for preferential tax treatment. This means REITs, limited partnerships, and other specialized tax structures can offer substantially higher-than-average dividend yields (the average yield of the S&P 500 is around 2%) and have them be remarkably sustainable. However, the data is pretty clear that high-yield dividend stocks are nowhere near as sure a thing as you'd be led to believe. According to data released last summer by Mellon Capital, the realized dividend yield of high-yield S&P 500 dividend stocks between 1996 and 2015 was often much lower than investors expected. According to Mellon Capital and FactSet Research Systems' data, S&P 500 stocks with an average yield of greater than 16% had a realized dividend yield of just over 3% when all was said and done. In other words, these payouts weren't very sustainable, and in many cases they were cut considerably. In fact, S&P 500 companies with a projected yield of 3% to 4% had realized yields that topped those with forecast yields of 16%-plus. Overall, the gap between realized dividend yields and forecast yields widened with every 1% step up in yields beginning at the 4% to 5% category. In short, if it seems too good to be true when it comes to a dividend yield, it very well might be. Image source: Getty Images. For instance, telecom company Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) is sporting a 17% dividend yield within the S&P 500. If this were somehow sustainable, investors would be able to double their money on dividend income alone in less than five years. However, this ridiculously high yield masks the underlying problems Frontier is contending with. Frontier has on a few occasions acquired wireline assets from Verizon over the past decade. Though these tend to be higher-margin assets, they also represent a decaying technology given the proliferation of wireless connectivity. As such, Frontier has been facing a quarterly exodus of customers for years. Between its high debt levels and recently disappointing earnings results, it's looking like only a matter of time before Frontier cuts its dividend. And to make matters worse, its share price is down 55% over the last 12 months, meaning its 17% yield isn't doing much to stem the share-price losses tied to the underlying issues in the company. Your best bet when looking for dividend income is to find a stable company that appears to be valued at a discount. High-yield dividend stocks can be a plus for your income portfolio, but only after they've passed a pretty rigorous sniff test that you conduct! ","

You picked an internet provider. The hard part is over, right? Well, almost. After you select your speed — and your bundle, if you go that route — you need to make one last decision: Rent a modem and router from your provider or buy your own. Running the numbers makes the decision easy. You need a modem for your internet to work. If you want Wi-Fi, you’ll need a router, too. Internet providers typically charge $10 to $15 a month to lease an all-in-one modem and router. So, over two years, you’ll pay $240 to $360 for your modem-router combo. But you can purchase your own modem and router, separately or in a combo unit, for less than the cost of renting. A Netgear high-speed cable modem-router combo sells for around $70 on Amazon

                                   Cable or Cox Communications. Most tech experts suggest opting for a separate modem and router over a combo unit. The reason: You can get more out of your router — features, settings and power — if it’s a stand-alone unit. Buying your modem and router will save you money in the long run, but there are a few scenarios in which renting makes sense. You have roommates. Splitting the cost of a modem and router is easy. Figuring out how to divvy up the device should one or more roommates move out — not so much. Unless you can settle on a system that works for everyone, renting and splitting the bill will likely save headaches down the road. Your employer foots the bill. Some lucky folks don’t pay for their internet service. Instead, their company pays the monthly bill. They may not pay for equipment, though. If that’s you, don’t dig into your wallet for a new modem. You’re moving soon. If your living situation is temporary, renting might make the most sense. Especially if you don’t know where you’ll land next and what your internet options will be when you get there. That said, if you know those things, you might be able to buy equipment that will work when you settle into more permanent digs. If you’re particularly tech averse, you may also be inclined to rent, since your internet provider may offer free troubleshooting and repair services only on modems leased or purchased through it. Just keep in mind that most modems and routers are easy to set up and require little to no fiddling once they’re up and running. Routers are universal and can be used with any internet service provider. Modems are a slightly different story. First, you need to make sure the modem’s compatible with your internet provider. Most carriers have a list of approved modems on their website and many major providers allow the same devices. So you can often keep your modem if you switch providers, as long as it’s the same type of internet service (cable, DSL or fiber). Some providers, like Verizon Fios, don’t let customers use their own equipment. But Fios customers can opt to buy their modem directly from Verizon,

                                   an option that will save you roughly $90 over two years compared with renting. The next step: Make sure the modem has staying power. This rule applies even if you’re buying it directly from your provider. Internet speeds are only getting faster and older modems — those with DOCSIS 2.0 technology — top out at 38 Mbps download speeds. If you’re paying for internet speeds of 30 Mbps or higher, or think you might in the future, spring for a model with DOCSIS 3.0 technology. These support speeds up to 150 Mbps, which is plenty fast for even the most connected families. Once you’ve settled on a compatible modem, consider buying a used or refurbished model. You’ll save even more money and lose little to nothing in terms of performance. Just make sure you’re clear on the return policy should you have any issues. Buying a modem and router will increase your upfront costs, but lower your monthly internet bill. Most tech experts suggest buying separate devices, but a combo unit will get the job done if you’re trying to keep things simple. Either way, you’ll save money in the long run. And that’s always a smart decision. More from NerdWallet: Kelsey Sheehy is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: ksheehy@nerdwallet.com. Twitter: @KelseyLSheehy.

540,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to sign a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules as a bigger fight looms over rules governing the openness of the internet, the White House said on Wednesday. Republicans in Congress on Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over Republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former President Barack Obama in 2015. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he did not know when Trump would sign the bill. The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. The reversal is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet the vote was “Terrible for American ppl, great for big biz.” Republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, in December said he believes that net neutrality’s days are numbered. The rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane” on the web’s information superhighway, to certain internet services. Critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. Pai told Reuters in February be backs “a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that” but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans. Trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality. ","

According to the rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission in October under then-President Barack Obama, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and internal marketing. The bill next goes to the U.S. House of Representatives, but it was not clear when they would take up the measure. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate was overturning a regulation that “makes the internet an uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition, innovation, and infrastructure investment.” But Democratic Senator Ed Markey said, “Republicans have just made it easier for American’s sensitive information about their health, finances and families to be used, shared, and sold to the highest bidder without their permission.” FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said consumers would have privacy protections even without the Obama administration internet provider rules. In a joint statement, Democratic members of the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission said the Senate vote “creates a massive gap in consumer protection law as broadband and cable companies now have no discernible privacy requirements.” The Internet and Television Association, a trade group, in a statement praised the vote as a “critical step towards re-establishing a balanced framework that is grounded in the long-standing and successful FTC privacy framework that applies equally to all parties operating online.” Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for advocacy group Consumers Union, said the vote “is a huge step in the wrong direction, and it completely ignores the needs and concerns of consumers.” ","

542,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"Google has come under intense scrutiny for ads appearing alongside videos on YouTube carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. The company vowed an overhaul of its practices and said on Wednesday it has started an extensive review of its advertising policies. Shares of Google parent Alphabet ended down 1.2 percent, or $10.15 per share, at $839.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Control over online ad placement has become a hot-button issue for advertisers, with social networks and news aggregators coming under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports. Advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. J&J said on Thursday it wanted to ensure that its product advertising did not appear on channels that promote ""offensive content."" (bit.ly/2nqZNJD) JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and the biggest issuer of general purpose credit cards, suspended all of its ads from YouTube on Thursday, according to spokeswoman Trish Wexler. The bank spends about $3 billion on marketing each year. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. While major brands suspending advertising on YouTube is a public relations pain for Google, the suspensions do not affect Google’s biggest ad product, search. According to eMarketer, Google’s 2017 global ad revenue is projected to be $73.75 billion, grabbing 62 percent of the $99.62-billion search market. Search accounts for 83 percent of Google’s overall ad revenue. The financial hit is also less certain because digital platforms tend to collect the bulk of their revenue from small-to-medium sized companies who cannot afford to buy on TV. “Digital dependence on the long-tail of advertising clients means that while major advertisers like P&G or agencies like Havas can publicly protest, they do not have the same impact on a Google or a Facebook as they have on a CBS or NBC,” analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote on Thursday. “In other words, if a major brand marketer or agency moves money to TV and out of digital, the TV industry will see the benefit whereas the digital industry might not truly feel it.” ","

543,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The London attack which left four people dead was a “wake up call” for technology firms to get their house in order over extremist material being circulated on the internet, the acting head of London’s police force said on Wednesday. The comments from Craig Mackey, acting Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, come after calls from politicians for tech firms, mainly based in the United States, to cooperate more with the authorities. “I think these sorts of incidents and the others we’ve seen in Europe are probably a bit of a wake-up call for the industry in terms of trying to understand what it means to put your own house in order,” Mackey told the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee. “If you are going to have ethical statement and talk about operating in an ethical way, it actually has to mean something. That is the sort of thing that obviously politicians and others will push now.” The British government and a series of well-known British brands such as Marks and Spencer Group Plc had already  suspended digital advertising with Alphabet Inc’s before the attack because ads were appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform with homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. They have since been joined by U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. The action has prompted Google to apologize and review its advertising practices. London police already have a specialist unit which aims to remove extremist material but Mackey said “the internet was never designed to be policed as such”. British officials have also demanded tech firms do more to allow police access to smartphone communications after reports that Khalid Masood had used encrypted messaging via WhatsApp before he drove a rented car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer by parliament. “We work hard with the industry to highlight the challenges of these very secure applications,” Mackey said. “It’s a challenge when you are dealing with companies that are global by their very nature because they don’t always operate under the same legal framework as us.” Regarding the police’s ongoing inquiry into last week’s attack, Mackey said detectives still believed Masood had acted alone. So far 12 people have been arrested, with two still in police custody. Mackey also said there had been a “slight uplift” in hate crimes directed at Muslims but not on the scale seen after previous similar incidents. ","

544,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"(Reuters) - The vote by the U.S. Congress to repeal rules that limit how internet service providers can use customer data has generated renewed interest in an old internet technology: virtual private networks, or VPNs. VPNs cloak a customer’s web-surfing history by making an encrypted connection to a private server, which then searches the Web on the customer’s behalf without revealing the destination addresses. VPNs are often used to connect to a secure business network, or in countries such as China and Turkey to bypass government restrictions on Web surfing. Privacy-conscious techies are now talking of using VPNs as a matter of course to guard against broadband providers collecting data about which internet sites and services they are using. “Time to start using a VPN at home,” Vijaya Gadde‏, general counsel of Twitter Inc, said in a tweet on Tuesday that was retweeted by Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Gadde was not immediately available for comment. Twitter said she was commenting in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the company. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives voted 215-205 on Tuesday to repeal rules adopted last year by the Federal Communications Commission under then-President Barack Obama to require broadband providers to obtain consumer consent before using their data for advertising or marketing. The U.S. Senate, also controlled by Republicans, voted 50-48 last week to reverse the rules. The White House said President Donald Trump supported the repeal measure. Supporters of the repeal said the FCC unfairly required internet service providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. Critics said the repeal would weaken consumers’ privacy protections. Protected data includes a customer’s web-browsing history, which in turn can be used to discover other types of information, including health and financial data. Some smaller broadband providers are now seizing on privacy as a competitive advantage. Sonic, a California-based broadband provider, offers a free VPN service to its customers so they can connect to its network when they are not home. That ensures that when Sonic users log on to wi-fi at a coffee shop or hotel, for example, their data is not collected by that establishment’s broadband provider. “We see VPN as being important for our customers when they’re not on our network. They can take it with them on the road,” CEO Dane Jasper said. In many areas of the country, there is no option to choose an independent broadband provider and consumers will have to pay for a VPN service to shield their browsing habits. Private Internet Access, a VPN provider, took a visible stand against the repeal measure when it bought a full-page ad in the New York Times on Sunday. But the company, which boasts about a million subscribers, potentially stands to benefit from the legislation, acknowledged marketing director Caleb Chen. VPNs have drawbacks. They funnel all user traffic through one point, so they are an attractive target for hackers and spies. The biggest obstacle to their routine use as a privacy safeguard is that they can be too much of a hassle to set up for many customers. They also cost money. “The further along toward being a computer scientist you have to be to use a VPN, the smaller a portion of the population we’re talking about that can use it,” said Ernesto Falcon, a legislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which opposed the bill.

The equity multiplier is therefore a variation of the debt ratio, in which the definition of debt financing includes all liabilities. Calculation of the equity multiplier is relatively simple and straightforward. Consider the balance sheet of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as of the end of fiscal year 2017.

Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) operates with a very different business model that includes more financial leverage. The company's total assets were $257 billion as of end of fiscal year 2017, with $43 billion of shareholder equity. The equity multiplier was 6x, based on these values.  Verizon's much lower proportionate shareholder equity value indicates that the business relies more heavily on financing from debt and other interest-bearing liabilities.

548,Rob Cox,3302017,CNBC,3232017,"Little is more satisfying than cracking open a vintage Sears, Roebuck & Co catalog and marveling at the breadth of its offerings, dated illustrations and all. The one for the spring and summer of 1971, for instance, runs to 1,071 pages and offers everything from Dacron polyester nurse uniforms to colonial birch-veneer bedroom sets. Sadly, this once-great American retailer of everything may not make it to its 130th birthday in one piece. The more enduring legacy of Sears, however, which published its first catalog back when Grover Cleveland was president, can be glimpsed deep within the nearly half-century-old edition. On page 432 is an application for a credit card. A few pages later there's the ""modernizing credit plan,"" allowing consumers in seven states to buy merchandise and defer payment. Sears Holding, the retailer, looks to be rapidly hurtling toward bankruptcy under the stewardship of hedge-fund boss Eddie Lampert. The financial-services businesses spawned by this empire – so robust a few decades ago that it built, in Chicago, the largest skyscraper in the free world – are alive and kicking. Therein lies a cautionary history lesson for Amazon.com, Alibaba and other internet conglomerates seeking international domination. The market capitalization of Sears has shrunk to around $1.25 billion, or a fraction of where it was a decade ago after Lampert merged it with rival Kmart to create what his investors hoped would form the foundation of the next Berkshire Hathaway. A recreation of Warren Buffett's model never happened. In fact, it's surprising that Sears shares have any value given the company's warning a week ago that it may not be able to continue as a ""going concern,"" auditor-speak for bankruptcy. Lampert dismantled much of what was left. He spun off a collection of real-estate assets, which trade as the $1.25 billion Seritage Growth Properties. He also stripped away the Lands' End apparel business, which Sears acquired for $1.9 billion in 2002 and now has a market value of $700 million. Sears set its Hometown and Outlet Stores unit free four years ago, too, and it's worth $97 million. It did the same for Orchard Supply Hardware, which Lowe's bought for $205 million in 2013. Sears Canada still sports an independent equity stub worth C$200 million. And earlier this year, Lampert offloaded the iconic Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $525 million upfront, some $250 million in a few years and royalties for the next 15 years. All told, that's more than $4 billion of value from the retail remnants. That sum excludes a significant portion of the Sears heritage, however. The company's attempts to offer credit to catalog shoppers led it to start the Discover Card in 1985. That business was bundled with Dean Witter Reynolds, the stock brokerage it acquired in 1981, and taken public in 1993. The combination later merged with Morgan Stanley, which spun off the credit-card arm a decade ago.

The U.S. wireless industry has undergone significant changes over the last few years. Pressure from smaller carriers T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) has forced incumbent telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to make significant changes to their services. Most recently, both introduced unlimited data plans, forgoing the potential to capitalize on Americans' ever-growing demand for data. Both AT&T and Verizon are struggling to hold onto subscribers as the competition eats into service revenue and margins. They are also expanding into media: AT&T with the purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), Verizon with smaller digital media acquisitions. Indeed, the two companies are very similar, but which is a better buy? Image source: Getty Images. A big reason for investing in AT&T or Verizon is their fat dividend. AT&T's and Verizon's dividend yields currently hover around 4.7%. That's well above the S&P 500's yield of around 2%. But investors shouldn't just look at yield. They should see whether the businesses can grow that dividend over time. Looking at both companies' balance sheets, we see AT&T is in a much better debt position than Verizon. AT&T's debt-to-equity ratio is 1:1 while Verizon's stands at 4.7. That said, AT&T could be on the hook for significantly more debt if its Time Warner acquisition goes through. Still, it won't push AT&T's ratio nearly as high as Verizon's. But if you look at their payout ratios (the percentage of earnings each company pays out as dividends), Verizon has a  slight advantage. At Verizon's current dividend rate, it's expected to pay out just 60% of 2017 earnings. AT&T, on the other hand, has a payout ratio of 67%. The ability of each company to grow its dividend will come down to whether it is able to grow cash flow and provide a strong return on invested capital. AT&T's strategy of making mega acquisitions to diversify away from its wireless business will negatively impact its return on invested capital. Verizon's acquisitions will also likely destroy shareholder value, but at least it's on a much smaller scale. Both companies might better serve shareholders by paying out a larger share of earnings as dividends, but pressure to keep growing the business is winning out. Verizon can comfortably service its debt with its cash flow, and its strategy lends itself to better dividend growth over the long run. Shares of Verizon and AT&T have headed in opposite directions over the past year. AT&T's share price is up about 6.5% over the trailing 12 months, while Verizon shares have fallen 8.3%. The result has been Verizon shares trading at a much more attractive valuation. Verizon's forward P/E ratio is just 12.8 compared to AT&T's 14.1 ratio. Even considering Verizon's debt situation, its EV/EBITDA ratio is comparable to AT&T's (7.5 vs 7.4). To be sure, investors expect much stronger earnings growth from AT&T over the long term. AT&T's acquisitions should help it grow earnings, but it's taking on more risk with the high prices it's paying. As such, Verizon's valuation makes it look more attractive for dividend investors. If you're looking at both AT&T and Verizon, you're probably more interested in a safe, growing dividend than earnings growth. While the two are interconnected, Verizon's advantages in its core wireless service (strong network and brand) ensure that it can grow steadily for years to come even if it faces near-term pressure. (The pressure from smaller carriers won't last forever as they eventually seek to generate cash flows on the level of their larger rivals.) That's why Verizon makes a better buy for most investors.

    Better Buy: Verizon Communications Inc. vs. AT&T -- The Motley Fool

Earlier this month, shareholders of both CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) and Level 3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) approved their merger by overwhelming majorities. Level 3 shareholders voted for the deal with an 81.2% majority (98.8% of the votes cast), while CenturyLink shareholders voted for the merger with 96.3% of the votes cast. As I had written previously, the merger should be beneficial, especially to shareholders of CenturyLink, as it will likely free up cash flow to maintain the company's high dividend. Now that the merger has cleared this first hurdle, what remains going forward, and what does this mean for shareholders? Image source: Getty Images. According to CenturyLink, the merger has already received approvals from many of the state agencies, including Ohio, Utah, Nevada, Georgia, West Virginia, Connecticut, Indiana, and Louisiana. Going forward, the companies still need regulatory approvals from the FCC, the Justice Department, and other agencies. The Justice Department will review the merger for antitrust issues, and will either approve the deal, approve it with conditions, or block the deal entirely. The FCC will then review the deal in a similar way, with more of a focus on competition and what it means for consumers of the combined companies' products and services. CenturyLink has stated that the combination will actually enable better competition and customer service. That's because, according to the companies, CenturyLink and Level 3's networks are mostly complementary, and Level 3 has many connections overseas. The companies say that this will enable better coordination in serving enterprise customers with offices and connections all over the world. Moreover, CenturyLink/Level 3 will still only be the second biggest enterprise network service provider, next to AT&T (NYSE:T). The companies believe they'll be able to compete better against AT&T and other big cable companies, thereby offering consumers better choices. These assertions, however, are being contested by smaller service provider companies and trade groups, such as INCOMPAS, which represents wireless carriers, as well as Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN). The latter two contend that Level 3 has been hiking prices for these smaller companies to connect to Level 3's long-haul backbone, and they fear that this will continue. Frontier and Windstream are both struggling mightily this year, so it is no surprise that they may wish to thwart the merger, which may marginalize them even further. For its part, INCOMPAS worries that the merger will reduce competition in the long-haul market, which CenturyLink and Level 3 both vehemently deny. Level 3 and CenturyLink point to AT&T (NYSE:T) Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR), and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as big competitors, plus, according to an FCC filing, ""precedent firmly establishes that no provider has the ability to set prices above competitive levels."" While I am no expert, it does appear that the objections to the deal have not been insurmountable, and that a deal is still likely. However, the companies also must get approval from the Department of Defense and Homeland Security due to Level 3's international footprint in Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Still, the market seems to be discounting a possibility that the deal will not go through. For instance, in the merger, Level 3 shareholders will receive $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink. Based on the closing prices as of Friday, March 16, CenturyLink traded at $23.65 per share, and Level 3 traded at $57.47 per share. Therefore, Level 3 shareholders would receive roughly $60.28 in value should the deal close, which is a difference of $2.81 from Level 3's current price. The companies expect the deal to close in Q3 of this year, so even adjusting for one CenturyLink dividend payment between now and then, the excess value is $2.27, or almost 4% above Level 3's price today. Of course, no one knows for sure if the deal will go through, or if the two companies will be able to integrate effectively and maintain their current price levels. That being said, those willing to play the merger arbitrage game may wish to take a look at Level 3. CenturyLink also sports a 9.2% yield and trades below book value, and I think the merger would be especially helpful to CenturyLink. Either way, the merger is an interesting play for investors in the telecom space today. ","

In the simplest sense, a moat is what separates a company from the competition. It is what keeps customers coming back year after year, and keeps the competition at arm's length for decades. Both AT&T and Frontier benefit from a huge moat, in that there are enormous barriers to entry in the telecom business. The upfront costs associated with setting up the infrastructure to deliver telephony and Internet are mind-boggling. But since both companies benefit from this moat, it isn't much of a differentiator. Instead, I look at the fact that AT&T is looking to diversify beyond simple telecom and become a content owner and distributor. It is doing that via its acquisitions of Time Warner and DirecTV. That, plus the fact that the company owns 32% of the wireless subscription market in the United States, is a powerful differentiator. Frontier, on the other hand, is a much smaller player that's going through growing pains while it attempts to integrate recent acquisitions it made from both AT&T and Verizon. There's no way it could focus right now on content ownership or delivery the way that AT&T is. The winner in this case is clear. Telecom investors love to see money coming back to them every quarter in the form of dividends. But it wouldn't be prudent for a company to spend all of its cash on payouts. That's because every company, at one point or another, will face uncertain economic times. Those that enter such times with lots of cash have options: buy back shares on the cheap, make strategic acquisitions, or -- most importantly -- outspend rivals to gain market share. Those that are debt-heavy are in the exact opposite boat, forced to narrow their focus just to make ends meet. Here's how AT&T and Frontier stack up in terms of financial fortitude, keeping in mind that AT&T is valued at over 100 times the size of Frontier. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow AT&T $7,500 million $114,000 million $13,000 million $17,800 million Frontier $322 million $17,600 million ($587 million) $265 million Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Because of the nature of the telecom industry, neither one of these companies sports a balance sheet worth bragging about. The real differentiator is usually free cash flow, but relative to their sizes, they both have similar cash flows. Instead, I look at Frontier's tenuous situation with its debt -- at 54 times its cash position, versus AT&T's ratio of just one-third that amount -- as the tiebreaker. As the recent worries over Frontier's debt have shown, this is something to worry about. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S Dividend FCF Payout AT&T 15 14 1.56 4.7% 66% Frontier N/A 9 0.29 20% 266% Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Nasdaq.com. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Given the massive drop in Frontier's stock lately, this is a lot closer than one might think. On a price-to-free cash flow basis, Frontier is 35% cheaper than AT&T. And even if Frontier has to cut its dividend by 50%, it will still be yielding more than AT&T. While AT&T's dividend is no doubt safer than Frontier's -- based on the payout ratio from free cash flow -- the risk/reward tips, ever so slightly, in Frontier's favor at this point. So there you have it: AT&T is the safer bet at today's prices. While Frontier is in the bargain basement at this point because of serious questions about its dividend, that alone isn't enough to make it a better buy. AT&T has a stronger moat around it, and a healthier balance sheet. Riskier investors may want to take a position in Frontier, but for the average American trying to build up his/her retirement portfolio, AT&T is the way to go. ","

More often than not, dividend stocks are what form the foundation of the best retirement portfolios. It's not hard to understand why, either. Over the long run, dividend-paying stocks have run circles around non-dividend paying stocks in terms of overall return. The first reason investors often seek dividend stocks is that a regular stipend serves as a beacon of assumed profitability and sustainability. In other words, in a perfect world no company is going to continue to share a percentage of its profits with investors if it doesn't believe it'll remain healthfully profitable and continue to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Dividend stocks are also quite helpful in hedging against the inevitable downside in the stock market. Since 1950, according to data from Yardeni Research, there have been 35 stock market corrections in the S&P 500 of at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number. While most dividend payments aren't going to completely cancel out this often short-term move lower in stock valuations, it does help ease investor worries in the short term. Finally, and arguably most importantly, dividend income can be reinvested back into more shares of stock via a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP. DRIPs are what top money managers use to generate significant wealth for their clients over the long run. However, dividends can also be deceptively dangerous if you aren't careful. If you don't take the time to understand the health of the business behind a dividend, or fully understand how a dividend is being funded, it could come back to haunt you. Here are two of what I'd consider to be the most dangerous types of dividend stocks. Arguably the most dangerous type of dividend stock is a high-yielding company (think 4%-plus yield) with a struggling business. Keep in mind that a dividend yield is nothing more than a company's annual payout as a function of its share price. If a company's share price has fallen 50% in a year, its dividend yield will have doubled. If you haven't taken the time to study how healthy the underlying business model is for a high-yield dividend stock, then you could be setting yourself up for trouble. Image source: Getty Images. For example, telecommunications service provider Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) currently has a dividend yield of 20% following the release of its less-then-stellar fourth-quarter results. Over the trailing 12-month period, Frontier's share price has fallen by 65%, which has more than doubled its dividend yield. If this yield were sustainable, investors could double their money in less than four years. However, if it looks too good to be true, it often is. Frontier is actually dealing with a number of issues that have no easy fix. The company believed that buying high-margin wireline assets from Verizon on a handful of occasions would allow it to generate significant cash flow. While that has partly been true, management apparently didn't do a great job of accounting for the rise of wireless mobile devices, which have made landlines somewhat obsolete. As a result, Frontier has been dealing with a steady loss of landline customers for years, which is eventually going to whittle away its cash flow and force what's likely to be another dividend cut. Broadband gains have also regularly disappointed Wall Street. The primary reason investors are buying Frontier's stock is its lucrative dividend, meaning more pain could be in store for shareholders if and when Frontier's payout is once again cut. It's no secret that a company paying a generous dividend will attract long-term income investors who's ownership tends to lessen volatility in a company's share price. However, when a company gets so desperate to reward shareholders that it issues debt in order to pay a dividend, there's reason to worry. Image source: Getty Images. Back in April 2014, Innoviva (NASDAQ:INVA), which was then known as Theravance and was planning to split into two separate companies, Innoviva and Theravance Biopharma, completed the private placement of $450 million in debt at a 9% rate. The reason for the offering from Innoviva was to ""support the initiation of a capital return strategy to the stockholders of Theravance, Inc. in conjunction with the previously announced spin-off of Theravance Biopharma."" In other words, the debt was to pay a $0.25-per-quarter dividend to shareholders. On paper, the company's decision to offer a dividend looked smart. Innoviva was the development partner that aided GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) in developing its cadre of next-generation long-lasting COPD and asthma medications, including Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta. If these therapies achieved their blockbuster sales expectations, Innoviva should be rolling in the dough as a royalties company with little overhead expenses. Here was the problem: Breo, Anoro, and the remainder of GlaxoSmithKline's and Innoviva's COPD and asthma drugs struggled out of the gate. Many have since improved, but it's been a challenge to bring to physicians' and consumers' attention that a new long-lasting COPD and asthma treatment option exists. The result is that Innoviva had, until recently, been losing money -- so much so that the company suspended its $0.25-per-quarter dividend after just five quarters in 2015. Though the company is profitable now, it's left with $478.5 million in non-recourse notes as of Dec. 31, 2016. All in all, issuing debt to fund a short-lived dividend was a terrible idea in hindsight. Income stocks can be a real asset to your portfolio, but you'll need to do some digging to ensure that a company's payout is sustainable. ","

Last week, Google updated its ad policies and expanded safeguards for advertisers after some pulled advertising from YouTube because the video streaming site was displaying ads next to inappropriate content that espoused hate or even terrorism. Google said in a blog post that it has put in place more controls for advertisers, and it is also taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.

Many analysts were quick to point out, though, that YouTube’s profit performance is a drop in the bucket as compared with that of the company, “perhaps no more than a few percent of total earnings,” Anmuth wrote Monday. The very large, name-brand advertisers that have promised to drop YouTube ads could also be trying to negotiate better rates “during a time when advertisers and agencies are looking for negotiating leverage against an increasingly duopolistic digital ad community” dominated by Google and Facebook Inc.

                                   . The Financial Times reported that advertisers are asking for discounts in pricing as a result. The bigger fear for investors is that an advertiser backlash could spread from YouTube to Google’s overall search business, or cast a pall over YouTube’s planned “skinny bundle” service. Since the story broke, Alphabet shares have fallen nearly 4%. Google’s efforts to handle the situation are getting mixed reviews from investors who see cause for concern. “Their public statements do not suggest to us that the company appreciates the degree to which advertisers are concerned and the continuing announcements of advertisers suspending their activity on Google properties reinforces our view,” Pivotal analyst Wieser wrote. Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research, predicted that Google will need to give out ad credits to lure back advertisers, which would also impact YouTube revenue. Don’t miss: This is what happens on the internet in just one minute The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the YouTube service was still rife with examples of ads running alongside offensive videos. Because the ads are automated, meaning they are placed using algorithms without human intervention, the advertisers also appear to need to be more involved in placing the ads themselves. Google said it is “changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and exchanges potentially objectionable content.” Google has managed to handle such controversies in the past, and, alongside Facebook

Frankly, I am shocked that Google is still having that problem. I remember when YouTube was launched 12 years ago, and the company had so many problems with copyright content being uploaded, and major media companies were coming down hard on Google after it subsequently bought YouTube. Within weeks Google had software that was able to root out all that copyrighted content. Here we are 12 years later and Google’s entire business model and cash flow rests on ads and ad networks, and this same issue apparently has not been solved. They are still having issues with ads being shown on places they shouldn’t be. Just last week, I trimmed my long-held Alphabet. Alphabet could catch a doghouse effect for a while. You know, the pendulum swings back and forth, and right now it’s looking like it could be swinging against Google.

In coming years, we’ll all be talking to our smartphones and asking questions rather than typing in queries. Likewise, I expect Amazon to try another shot at the smartphone game, using an Android operating system, but Amazon will have built the smartphone from the ground up to be Alexa-centric. The Amazon world has become its own ecosystem from Alexa, to Amazon.com to the Amazon App. The consumer side of Amazon is stealing a playbook from the Apple ecosystem concept. The Amazon ecosystem is in the very early stages. The upshot is that I think you want to continue to own both Google and Amazon for the long term. But I think there’s more upside potential in Amazon. In fact, I think Amazon could be another dark horse that ends up being the first trillion-dollar company. (It’s now worth $403 billion.)

The move also sets up Vestberg, 51, as a potential successor to Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam, he said. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier said Vestberg will initially be based in Sweden but join the U.S.-based team later this spring. “What bringing someone in for the outside means is you need a new perspective,” Entner said. Verizon also said it is restructuring operations into three areas including Vestberg’s team. The media and telematics unit will focus on new businesses in digital media, including integrating its pending acquisition of Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. It will be led by Marni Walden as executive vice president for media and telematics. The customer and product operations team, led by John Stratton, will work on operating and growing Verizon’s established businesses, such as Verizon Wireless and Verizon Enterprise Solutions. Walden and Stratton are also both seen as potential successors to McAdam, according to industry analysts. Ericsson is working with Verizon on trials for a next-generation 5G network, and Vestberg and McAdam have known each other for years, industry watchers said. ","

562,,4062017,Reuters,3302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said Friday they would not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information, days after the U.S. Congress approved legislation reversing Obama administration era internet privacy rules. The bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under former President Barack Obama requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The easing of restrictions has sparked growing anger on social media sites. “We do not sell our broadband customers’ individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCC’s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so,” said Gerard Lewis, Comcast’s chief privacy officer. He added Comcast is revising its privacy policy to make more clear that “we do not sell our customers’ individual web browsing information to third parties.” Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so in the future, said spokesman Richard Young. Verizon privacy officer Karen Zacharia said in a blog post Friday the company has two programs that use customer browsing data. One allows marketers to access “de-identified information to determine which customers fit into groups that advertisers are trying to reach” while the other “provides aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” Republicans in Congress Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the rules with no Democratic support and over the objections of privacy advocates. The vote was a win for internet providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast and Verizon. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules. The White House said Wednesday that President Donald Trump plans to sign the repeal of the rules, which had not taken effect. Under the rules, internet providers would have needed to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. Websites do not need the same affirmative consent. Some in Congress suggested providers would begin selling personal data to the highest bidder, while others vowed to raise money to buy browsing histories of Republicans. AT&T says in its privacy statement it “will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose. Period.” In a blog post Friday, AT&T said it would not change those policies after Trump signs the repeal. Websites and internet service providers do use and sell aggregated customer data to advertisers. Republicans say the rules unfairly would give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet providers. Trade group USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter said in an op-ed Friday for website Axios that individual “browser history is already being aggregated and sold to advertising networks - by virtually every site you visit on the internet.” This week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.” ","

563,,4062017,Reuters,3302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers’ privacy than websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google or Facebook Inc. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having “appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet.” Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers.” Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the “FTC’s authority to police internet service providers’ privacy practices.” Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers’ individual internet browsing information. Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use “de-identified” customer browsing data, including one that uses “aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses.” The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed “industry pressure to put profits over privacy” and added “most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded.” Trade group USTelecom Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for “stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework.” Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans “believe that their private information should be just that.” Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility - a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight.

The details released on Thursday removed some uncertainty in the market on how Comcast would price and roll out its service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile. Comcast shares closed 2.1 percent higher at $38.13. Comcast is moving into wireless as cable companies seek to add more services to reduce customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast’s service will launch on Verizon’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will allow customers to switch automatically to Comcast’s Wi-Fi hotspots from 4G LTE. Comcast will limit the service’s rollout to customers within its footprint, which includes major markets like Philadelphia and Chicago. It will initially be available only to subscribers with Xfinity broadband service. Comcast had roughly 25 million high-speed Internet customers in 2016, according to a filing. It did not state its investment in Xfinity Mobile or the expected return. Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said in a meeting with analysts on Thursday that the service would be cash flow positive over time. Analysts at JPMorgan wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a note earlier this week that Comcast’s agreement with Verizon was merely a way to enter the market. “Comcast will secure far better economics in wireless in time, either through a network sharing arrangement with or an acquisition of one or more carriers,” he said.

565,,4062017,Reuters,3302017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is moving quickly to replace the Obama administration’s landmark net neutrality rules and wants internet service providers to voluntarily agree to maintain an open internet, three sources briefed on the meeting said Thursday. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, met on Tuesday with major telecommunications trade groups to discuss his preliminary plan to reverse the rules, the sources said. The FCC declined to comment but Pai previously said he is committed to ensuring an open internet but feels net neutrality was a mistake. The rules approved by the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama in early 2015 prohibited broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane”, to certain internet services over others. As part of that change, the FCC reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. Pai wants to overturn that reclassification, but wants internet providers to voluntarily agree to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content, two officials said late Tuesday. The officials briefed on the meeting said Pai suggested companies commit in writing to open internet principles and including them in their terms of service, which would make them binding. It is unclear if regulators could legally compel internet providers to adopt open internet principles without existing net neutrality rules. As part of that move, the Federal Trade Commission would assume oversight of ensuring compliance. Three sources said Pai plans to unveil his proposal to overturn the rules as early as late April and it could face an initial vote in May or June. Internet providers like AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued net neutrality rules would make it harder to manage internet traffic and investment in additional capacity less likely. Websites worry that without the rules they might lose access to customers. AT&T and major trade groups sued the FCC in 2015 over the net neutrality rules. Democrats and privacy advocates say net neutrality is crucial to keeping the internet open. Pai in December predicted that net neutrality’s days were numbered. He told Reuters in February he believes “in a free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures that.” Pai and congressional Republicans have moved quickly to dismantle Obama-era telecommunications rules. Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Politico Pro reported some details of the meeting with trade groups on Thursday. ","

Called “Family CyberEdge,” it includes public relations and legal services, as well as at-home assessments of family electronic devices, executives said in an interview. Wealthy, high-profile individuals have increasingly become hacker targets, said Jerry Hourihan, president of AIG Private Client Group for the United States and Canada. Social media use and online financial information make them vulnerable. “They are more exposed than they ever have been,” Hourihan said in an interview. AIG’s product follows cyber offerings from rivals, along with services from credit-monitoring firms and companies like Reputation.com – a trend that is poised to accelerate as people share more information online, analysts said. Consumers now share loads of personal data on websites and apps and store photos and sensitive information in cloud platforms. “Whenever you see a lot of news about something that is a risk, you usually see insurance companies trying to jump on that,” said Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. AIG’s product came after customers asked for protection, Hourihan said. His unit caters to very wealthy individuals and typically insures assets like wine collections and fine art. Policies cost roughly 10 to 15 percent of a homeowner’s premium, Hourihan said. They also cover restoring data and monitoring cyber threats. Last year, a U.S.-based unit of German insurer Munich Re launched a personal cyber security policy that covers expenses like malware removal and online fraud reimbursement, according to its website. Premiums vary, but typically cost less than $100 for $25,000 to $50,000 worth of coverage. New York-based PURE Insurance launched its cyber security product in 2015. ","

The combination of Yahoo’s internet assets with AOL will be called Oath, a name that has already attracted plenty of ridicule across Silicon Valley and in the media with comparisons being made to the notoriously bad ""Tronc."" According to a tweet from AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, Oath will oversee more than 20 brands and reach more than a billion consumers. Both the Yahoo and AOL brands are expected to survive, although Verizon refused to reveal any further details about the new entity until this summer. (See also: Verizon Finally Acquires Yahoo Core Operations.) Recode’s sources claim that Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who encountered a major hacking disaster and a prolonged trading downturn in a difficult four years at the helm of the internet giant, will not be joining Oath. Those challenges, coupled with a reputation for lavish spending and mistimed acquisitions — under her leadership Yahoo bought social networking platform Tumblr for $1.1 billion — led many to expect Mayer’s departure. Recode added that Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products at Yahoo, is also likely to get the boot, while communications products head Jeff Bonforte is set to be one of the few executives to stay. Armstrong will make the rest of his choices on who to keep and axe shortly. At risk are Yahoo’s Chief Revenue Officer Lisa Utzschneider and advertising and search product boss Enrique Muñoz Torres. Verizon’s decision to takeover Yahoo was motivated by big plans to expand into higher growth markets such as mobile media and advertising, where the likes of Facebook (FB) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL) are capturing billions in ad dollars. The deal had initially been delayed due to data breaches at Yahoo but is now expected to close shortly. (See also: Google, Facebook Dominate Digital Ads in 2017.)

569,Joana Allamani,4062017,Investopedia,3302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On Tuesday, March 28 Congress voted to overturn privacy measures enacted in October under the Obama administration that would have prevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) from sharing their customers’ internet activity with third parties without their permission. The vote also blocks the FCC from making any such privacy protecting rules in the future. While ISPs are happy with this ruling, consumers are left worried. How can you protect your privacy with this new ruling? A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be a great way to maintain your privacy and stop your ISP from monitoring and collecting information on your web usage habits and search history. When you use a VPN, the data you send and receive over the internet is encrypted before it reaches your ISP, so they will only be able to see the amount of data sent and received, but not the content. You can choose one out of numerous VPN providers who may provide their services for free or usually a monthly price, or set up your own VPN and connect to that. However, beware of free VPN providers, says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, quoted in an article on VPNs in The Verge. If they do not charge anything, they could probably be logging your traffic and selling it to third parties. Do not sign up for a free VPN service without doing your research – at least check their privacy policy and terms of service. Hotspot Shield and CyberGhost VPN are examples of free providers that don’t log your usage and say that openly. With paid providers, Some VPN companies offer custom software, which creates that encryption that blocks the ISP from seeing the content of your web-browsing history. In addition to the providers who offer their own software, there are companies that use one pre-shared key for all of their customers. This could be risky, in that a person who controls a particular WiFi network could use that key to decrypt traffic used over the VPN, essentially nullifying the protection. Additionally, while you have several paid VPN service providers to choose from, it is important to consider the security of the VPN provider itself – transparency can be an issue among VPN companies and it is hard to determine which provider you can and cannot trust. After all, the VPN provider can see your traffic, and an untrustworthy one can sell your data to a third party just like your ISP can. Creating and setting up your own VPN server can be a safer option, where you might have to pay for the nominal cost of a server and then have total control over your traffic. Streisand and Algo are two systems that allow a user to set up their own VPN. You could even get a router with VPN capabilities; some higher end home routers come with built in VPN servers. Once you get those, you could simply use your web-browser to activate and then configure the server. Lastly, you can use your own computer to set up a VPN server. However, the particular computer you use needs to always be turned on. ","Stop Internet Companies Selling Your Data with a VPN (CMCSA,VZ) | Investopedia",0.9915
570, ,4062017,CNBC,3302017,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules, the White House said, a victory for internet service providers and a blow to privacy advocates. Republicans in Congress last week narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The signing, disclosed in White House statement late on Monday, follows strong criticism of the bill, which is a win for AT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications. The bill repeals regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customers' privacy than websites like Alphabet's Google or Facebook. The rules had not yet taken effect but would have required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, children's information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai praised the repeal in a statement late on Monday for having ""appropriately invalidated one part of the Obama-era plan for regulating the internet."" Those flawed privacy rules, which never went into effect, were designed to benefit one group of favored companies, not online consumers."" Pai said the FCC would work with the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees websites, to restore the ""FTC's authority to police internet service providers' privacy practices."" Republican FCC commissioners have said the Obama rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers. The action is the latest in a string of reversals of Obama administration rules. On Monday, the FCC reversed a requirement that Charter Communications Inc extend broadband service to 1 million homes that already have a high-speed provider. On Friday, Comcast, Verizon AT&T Inc said they would voluntarily not sell customers' individual internet browsing information. Verizon does not sell personal web browsing histories and has no plans to do so but the company said it has two advertising programs that use ""de-identified"" customer browsing data, including one that uses ""aggregate insights that might be useful for advertisers and other businesses."" The American Civil Liberties Union said last month Congress should have opposed ""industry pressure to put profits over privacy"" and added ""most Americans believe that their sensitive internet information should be closely guarded."" Trade group USTelecom Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter in a statement praised Trump for ""stopping rules that would have created a confusing and conflicting consumer privacy framework."" Last week, 46 Senate Democrats urged Trump not to sign the bill, arguing most Americans ""believe that their private information should be just that."" Republicans later this year are expected to move to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility - a move that is expected to spark an even bigger fight.

571,Rob Cox,4062017,CNBC,3302017,"Little is more satisfying than cracking open a vintage Sears, Roebuck & Co catalog and marveling at the breadth of its offerings, dated illustrations and all. The one for the spring and summer of 1971, for instance, runs to 1,071 pages and offers everything from Dacron polyester nurse uniforms to colonial birch-veneer bedroom sets. Sadly, this once-great American retailer of everything may not make it to its 130th birthday in one piece. The more enduring legacy of Sears, however, which published its first catalog back when Grover Cleveland was president, can be glimpsed deep within the nearly half-century-old edition. On page 432 is an application for a credit card. A few pages later there's the ""modernizing credit plan,"" allowing consumers in seven states to buy merchandise and defer payment. Sears Holding, the retailer, looks to be rapidly hurtling toward bankruptcy under the stewardship of hedge-fund boss Eddie Lampert. The financial-services businesses spawned by this empire – so robust a few decades ago that it built, in Chicago, the largest skyscraper in the free world – are alive and kicking. Therein lies a cautionary history lesson for Amazon.com, Alibaba and other internet conglomerates seeking international domination. The market capitalization of Sears has shrunk to around $1.25 billion, or a fraction of where it was a decade ago after Lampert merged it with rival Kmart to create what his investors hoped would form the foundation of the next Berkshire Hathaway. A recreation of Warren Buffett's model never happened. In fact, it's surprising that Sears shares have any value given the company's warning a week ago that it may not be able to continue as a ""going concern,"" auditor-speak for bankruptcy. Lampert dismantled much of what was left. He spun off a collection of real-estate assets, which trade as the $1.25 billion Seritage Growth Properties. He also stripped away the Lands' End apparel business, which Sears acquired for $1.9 billion in 2002 and now has a market value of $700 million. Sears set its Hometown and Outlet Stores unit free four years ago, too, and it's worth $97 million. It did the same for Orchard Supply Hardware, which Lowe's bought for $205 million in 2013. Sears Canada still sports an independent equity stub worth C$200 million. And earlier this year, Lampert offloaded the iconic Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker for $525 million upfront, some $250 million in a few years and royalties for the next 15 years. All told, that's more than $4 billion of value from the retail remnants. That sum excludes a significant portion of the Sears heritage, however. The company's attempts to offer credit to catalog shoppers led it to start the Discover Card in 1985. That business was bundled with Dean Witter Reynolds, the stock brokerage it acquired in 1981, and taken public in 1993. The combination later merged with Morgan Stanley, which spun off the credit-card arm a decade ago.

The U.S. wireless industry is fiercely competitive these days. The smaller carriers, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S), have been extremely aggressive in their efforts to grab share from an increasingly saturated market. T-Mobile has been very proactive with its pricing and promotions, while Sprint is content to undercut the competitor's pricing at every turn. As a result, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are both seeing pressure on their results. Most recently, we've seen the return of unlimited data plans, something Verizon insisted was unnecessary right up to the point when it finally unveiled its new offer. Meanwhile, Verizon continues to make sizable acquisitions and expenditures in digital media in an effort to diversify away from the wireless industry. Both factors should give Verizon investors something to worry about. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's new unlimited data plan should attract a fair number of customers while keeping many of Verizon's current subscribers from leaving. Verizon has lost postpaid phone subscribers in the first quarter of each of the last two years. That should change this year. The problem is, it won't generate as much revenue per subscriber. President of Operations John Stratton even said as much during an investors conference earlier this year. ""The first guys that you see come across are typically the ones who benefit greatest sort of on their bottom of the bill,"" he said. Verizon's new unlimited plan costs less than its previous highest-tier plan, so those subscribers will switch instantly, putting pressure on revenue per subscriber. Meanwhile, Verizon will see its costs per subscriber increase as it delivers more data to customers' smartphones. A big piece of Verizon's branding is its network reliability. It needs to continue investing in its network to maintain its leading position. On the positive side, Verizon has managed to maintain its unlimited plan pricing above its competitors. Verizon's unlimited plan costs at least as much as comparable plans on the market. Verizon's ability to maintain premium pricing is a good indicator that its brand is still strong. Faced with meager growth in the wireless industry, Verizon has made several large acquisitions to boost its presence in digital media. AT&T is also pursuing acquisitions, but on an even larger scale. AT&T spent $49 billion to acquire DirecTV, and it agreed to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion. Verizon's billions in acquisitions look like small potatoes by comparison. Still, both buying sprees could easily destroy shareholder value by leaving the companies in weakened financial states. If and when they need money to support their core wireless businesses, they'll likely have to tap the debt markets. Both companies already carry over $100 billion in debt, although that's supported by stellar cash flows. Verizon's decision to enter the digital media and advertising space is interesting. While the market for digital advertising is growing quickly (making it attractive), that market growth comes mainly from two companies. Verizon's ability to take share is suspect. While I believe Verizon could feel some pain in the short term as competitive pressures continue to weigh on its wireless business, I'm still bullish in the long run. At some point, T-Mobile and Sprint will feel pressure to produce meaningful cash flows, making their current pace of promotions and discounts unsustainable. Both companies have weak balance sheets being propped up by parent companies. At some point, something has to give at T-Mobile and Sprint. Perhaps an acquisition or merger takes the pressure off of subscriber growth. There have been several rumors circulating about a tie-up with a pay-TV provider, which would allow the new merged company to compete more effectively against the TV-wireless juggernaut of AT&T without resorting to undercutting pricing. Either way, Verizon's long-term position still looks good considering the strength of its wireless network and the size of its retail customer base. I'll be monitoring the situation with the smaller competitors closely, and I'm hoping management doesn't make any more big acquisitions, but unless things change considerably, I'm fine holding my shares. After all, the company is paying me a hefty 4.7% dividend to be patient. ","

After AT&T (NYSE:T) launched DirecTV Now at the end of last year, both Hulu and YouTube have announced new linear TV streaming services, joining established services such as DISH Network's (NASDAQ:DISH) Sling TV and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation Vue. Now, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is reportedly looking to enter the over-the-top market this summer with a nationwide television streaming service. The telecom company secured the streaming rights to networks as it renewed contracts for its existing FiOS TV service. Verizon's wireline video service growth slowed considerably last year. Will a new streaming service reinvigorate Verizon's television efforts? Image source: Getty Images. The major differences between linear TV streaming services comes down to content rights. AT&T said its biggest advantage with DirecTV Now is its scale as a pay-TV provider. After buying DirecTV, AT&T has over 25 million video subscribers. By comparison, Verizon has just 4.7 million FiOS TV subscribers. Verizon doesn't even have the scale of DISH Network, which counts 13.7 million subscribers. Scale is important because it gives the service provider leverage against the content providers. AT&T is probably paying less per subscriber for the streaming rights to ESPN than Verizon agreed to pay because it's sending 20 million more subscribers to ESPN than Verizon is. Sony was one of the first to launch an over-the-top linear TV service, and it started with absolutely no scale. Nonetheless, its service and pricing is competitive, but it's lost several notable content contracts during its two-year existence. Still, it's managed to attract 400,000 subscribers to PlayStation Vue. Whether Sony is making a profit on those subscribers is unclear, but it shows that getting the best content pricing isn't the only thing needed to take some market share. Verizon has a couple of main advantages over most of its competitors. The biggest advantage is the 114 million retail customer relationships it already has through its wireless business. Verizon can offer discounts for bundling its new streaming service with its wireless service. AT&T is using that strategy with DirecTV Now. It's offering $25 off DirecTV Now per month and free HBO for subscribers of its AT&T Plus plan. No other competitors can offer something similar. The second advantage Verizon has is its recent investments in digital advertising. Over the past few years, Verizon has made several large acquisitions of digital media and advertising companies. Lending that expertise to a streaming television service could help Verizon produce higher ad revenue than its competitors, allowing it to price its service competitively even if it has to pay more for content. All pay-TV providers receive a couple of minutes of ad space per hour for their own ads. Verizon could, however, win over some ad space from media companies if it can show superb results with its own inventory. That could produce additional revenue for Verizon, allowing it to produce higher margins or lower pricing to compete. Ultimately, Verizon is fairly well positioned to compete in an increasingly crowded market even though it doesn't have the scale of some of the current services. The revenue from the streaming service won't be huge compared with Verizon's wireless business, but bundling the offering could make Verizon's services stickier. ","

582,Daniel B. Kline,4062017,Fool,3302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier (NASDAQ:FTR) has struggled mightily in its attempts to become a bigger player in the cable and internet space. But even as it has bled some of the subscribers it paid Verizon (NYSE:VZ) $10.54 billion for, it has had one major thing going for it -- its dividend. Now, as the company considers a reverse split to keep its stock above NASDAQ's $1 per share threshold, the value of that dividend, and whether it will continue to exist at all has become highly questionable. Frontier has already declared it will pay a dividend of $0.105 per common share in Q1 payable on March 31 to people who owned shares at the close of business on March 15. That's good short-term news for embattled investors, and in-line with what it has paid for the past two years, but the long-term prospects look bleak. Image source: YCharts. The company has seen its stock price steadily fall as it has struggled to hold onto the 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) it purchased from Verizon. Frontier's losses in Q2, the first quarter after the deal closed, were expected, but the drop in Q3 was harder to explain. When the company lost another 144,000 residential subscribers and 14,000 more business customers in Q4, questions as to whether the company could turn things around became legitimate. As you can see on the chart above, the company's stock price has been falling fairly steadily all year. Frontier's failure to at least stabilize its subscriber loss in Q4, after suggesting it would happen during the Q2 and Q3 earnings calls, sent its stock price plummeting, something the company likely expected as it floated the idea of a reverse split in its Q4 earnings release: Frontier also announced that its Board of Directors has approved and will place before Frontier's stockholders at the May 2017 Annual Meeting a charter amendment for a reverse stock split of Frontier Communications common stock. The charter amendment will provide for a reverse stock split ratio between 1-for-10 and 1-for-25, with the Board designating the final ratio within 90 days after the charter amendment is approved by stockholders. It's easy to see why Frontier pays a dividend. The payments keep shareholders on board while the company tries to transform itself. The problem is that Frontier lost $80 million in Q4 and $373 million for the year, before paying the dividend. After the payments are factored in the full-year loss jumps to $587 million. Frontier has been losing video subscribers. Image source: Getty Images. The company, it's important to note, has not suggested it will eliminate its dividend. In fact, CEO Daniel McCarthy implied that Frontier planned to keep it during the Q4 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required), saying that the board had considered the issue two weeks before the call. ""They obviously look at the allocation of capital and resources for us,"" he said. ""They reviewed the complete plan that we presented on 2017, as well as the cash flows and all the initiatives that we're undertaking right now and they were comfortable declaring the dividend. So there has been no change in our policy on that perspective and they will just continue to evaluate that going forward."" The problem is that continuing to borrow money in order to fund a dividend has its obvious drawbacks. In the long-term it's not sustainable, but if the company eliminates the dividend after its reverse split, it runs the risk of seeing its newly propped-up stock sink further. That leaves it with three options: Frontier has said it plans to go forward as it has, but has left itself wiggle room to make a change. McCarthy's statement was qualified by the words ""right now"" and it's very likely that if results -- specifically subscriber counts -- do not turn around in Q1, then the dividend will be very much in jeopardy. Were that to happen, it would make an already struggling stock even less attractive, and perhaps force the company to consider a sale or pursue other strategic options. ","
      
    The Biggest Risk Facing Frontier Communications -- The Motley Fool

583,Sean Williams,4062017,Fool,3302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. More often than not, dividend stocks are what form the foundation of the best retirement portfolios. It's not hard to understand why, either. Over the long run, dividend-paying stocks have run circles around non-dividend paying stocks in terms of overall return. The first reason investors often seek dividend stocks is that a regular stipend serves as a beacon of assumed profitability and sustainability. In other words, in a perfect world no company is going to continue to share a percentage of its profits with investors if it doesn't believe it'll remain healthfully profitable and continue to grow. Image source: Getty Images. Dividend stocks are also quite helpful in hedging against the inevitable downside in the stock market. Since 1950, according to data from Yardeni Research, there have been 35 stock market corrections in the S&P 500 of at least 10%, when rounded to the nearest whole number. While most dividend payments aren't going to completely cancel out this often short-term move lower in stock valuations, it does help ease investor worries in the short term. Finally, and arguably most importantly, dividend income can be reinvested back into more shares of stock via a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP. DRIPs are what top money managers use to generate significant wealth for their clients over the long run. However, dividends can also be deceptively dangerous if you aren't careful. If you don't take the time to understand the health of the business behind a dividend, or fully understand how a dividend is being funded, it could come back to haunt you. Here are two of what I'd consider to be the most dangerous types of dividend stocks. Arguably the most dangerous type of dividend stock is a high-yielding company (think 4%-plus yield) with a struggling business. Keep in mind that a dividend yield is nothing more than a company's annual payout as a function of its share price. If a company's share price has fallen 50% in a year, its dividend yield will have doubled. If you haven't taken the time to study how healthy the underlying business model is for a high-yield dividend stock, then you could be setting yourself up for trouble. Image source: Getty Images. For example, telecommunications service provider Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) currently has a dividend yield of 20% following the release of its less-then-stellar fourth-quarter results. Over the trailing 12-month period, Frontier's share price has fallen by 65%, which has more than doubled its dividend yield. If this yield were sustainable, investors could double their money in less than four years. However, if it looks too good to be true, it often is. Frontier is actually dealing with a number of issues that have no easy fix. The company believed that buying high-margin wireline assets from Verizon on a handful of occasions would allow it to generate significant cash flow. While that has partly been true, management apparently didn't do a great job of accounting for the rise of wireless mobile devices, which have made landlines somewhat obsolete. As a result, Frontier has been dealing with a steady loss of landline customers for years, which is eventually going to whittle away its cash flow and force what's likely to be another dividend cut. Broadband gains have also regularly disappointed Wall Street. The primary reason investors are buying Frontier's stock is its lucrative dividend, meaning more pain could be in store for shareholders if and when Frontier's payout is once again cut. It's no secret that a company paying a generous dividend will attract long-term income investors who's ownership tends to lessen volatility in a company's share price. However, when a company gets so desperate to reward shareholders that it issues debt in order to pay a dividend, there's reason to worry. Image source: Getty Images. Back in April 2014, Innoviva (NASDAQ:INVA), which was then known as Theravance and was planning to split into two separate companies, Innoviva and Theravance Biopharma, completed the private placement of $450 million in debt at a 9% rate. The reason for the offering from Innoviva was to ""support the initiation of a capital return strategy to the stockholders of Theravance, Inc. in conjunction with the previously announced spin-off of Theravance Biopharma."" In other words, the debt was to pay a $0.25-per-quarter dividend to shareholders. On paper, the company's decision to offer a dividend looked smart. Innoviva was the development partner that aided GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) in developing its cadre of next-generation long-lasting COPD and asthma medications, including Breo Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta. If these therapies achieved their blockbuster sales expectations, Innoviva should be rolling in the dough as a royalties company with little overhead expenses. Here was the problem: Breo, Anoro, and the remainder of GlaxoSmithKline's and Innoviva's COPD and asthma drugs struggled out of the gate. Many have since improved, but it's been a challenge to bring to physicians' and consumers' attention that a new long-lasting COPD and asthma treatment option exists. The result is that Innoviva had, until recently, been losing money -- so much so that the company suspended its $0.25-per-quarter dividend after just five quarters in 2015. Though the company is profitable now, it's left with $478.5 million in non-recourse notes as of Dec. 31, 2016. All in all, issuing debt to fund a short-lived dividend was a terrible idea in hindsight.

Longtime investors in streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) know that its relationship with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has been a rocky one. The two have sparred for years over a variety of issues including broadband access fees, corporate mergers, and net neutrality. In fact, many would argue that the phenomenon of cord-cutting -- customers ditching their cable subscriptions -- was the direct result of the flat-rate online video streaming service that Netflix pioneered in 2007. There has been a lot of animosity between the two over the years. In recent years, a number of secondary providers like Verizon Communications Inc. and Dish Network sought to capitalize on the trend of cord-cutters and cord-nevers -- those that never had cable or satellite -- by offering customers the option of a skinny bundle, a smaller subset of cable channels for a markedly lower price. This was an attempt to entice customers that were unwilling to pay for a full cable subscription. Netflix is winning the battle for the living room. Image source: Netflix. Several recent developments reveal that cord-cutting, skinny bundles, and the popularity of streaming services offered by Netflix and others may have finally worn down the cable colossus. Reuters is reporting that after testing the concept in several markets, Comcast will offer a slimmed-down bundle branded Xfinity Instant TV, which will provide major broadcast networks and sports channels like ESPN and Spanish language channels such as Telemundo and Univision for between $15 and $40 per month. The package will include a cloud-based DVR and be available across internet-connected devices. The report indicates that Comcast is planning to expand the service nationwide in its markets beginning in the third quarter of 2017. This is the latest in a series of events that illustrates a change of attitude by the cable behemoth. After waging a public relations battle in the media for much of 2014 over the issues of net neutrality and access fees, there has been a thawing of the chilly relations between Comcast and Netflix in recent months. In July of last year, Recode reported that Netflix would be available on the Comcast set-top box. When asked for a statement, the companies replied: Comcast and Netflix have reached an agreement to incorporate Netflix into X1, providing seamless access to the great content offered by both companies. We have much work to do before the service will be available to consumers later this year. We'll provide more details at that time. By November those plans had been realized and the companies revealed in a joint press release that Netflix would be integrated throughout Comcast's X1 platform, combining the on-demand libraries of both services in a single interface. Comcast no doubt saw that the writing was on the wall and moves such as this one could slow the migration from its services. Image source: Comcast. Comcast is pursuing other venues to bolster its position. Bloomberg is reporting that Comcast has received authorization to offer certain cable channels nationwide to customers outside its traditional markets as an online distributor. The company hasn't received permissions from every network and doesn't yet have plans to offer an online service nationwide, but if it were to offer such a service, it would compete directly with AT&T Inc.'s DIRECTV Now and Dish Networks' Sling TV. Comcast also announced late last month that Netflix would be available for free to its X1 customers from April 3-9, similar to promotions it offers for services like HBO and Starz. These recent developments are a sign of the times as these once-bitter rivals partner to offer services to customers. About 54% of U.S. households subscribe to Netflix, and Comcast has disclosed that more than 30% of its X1 customers are Netflix subscribers. With that many customers watching Netflix, Comcast may have decided, ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."" ","

The Yahoo, AOL Brands Will Soon Die, To Be Replaced By ‘Oath’ https://t.co/ZCH0WqzmCz It is unlikely that Verizon plans to change the brand name on Yahoo’s core properties, however, because that could affect the number of people who still visit those sites and therefore ruin Verizon’s main reason for purchasing the business. Millions of people visit Yahoo’s core properties like Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News and Yahoo Finance, and changing the name could confuse users and drive them away. Oath is instead an umbrella name for all of the brands that will exist in that segment of Verizon, as Armstrong noted in his tweet by referencing “20+ brands” that will be a part of Oath.

An MSGN sale will not be easy, several sources said, as RSNs are considered mature and perhaps even a melting ice cube as viewers opt for skinny bundles and cord-cutting.

Comcast, which owns a piece of Mets’ rights-owner SNY, another Big Apple RSN, is said to be looking to exit the sector — not grow it, according to the RSN expert. Last year, James Dolan, MSGN’s executive chairman, and his family received $2 billion from selling Cablevision and should have little trouble funding a bid for The Garden if they choose to make such a move, the analyst said. On a positive note, if the board of MSG, which some think is undervalued, were interested in a quick MSGN sale, it might agree to reasonable rights fee increases, the RSN expert said. MSG Networks and Verizon declined comment. This report originally appeared on NYPost.com ",James Dolan’s New York sports broadcaster MSG Networks is looking to sell - MarketWatch,0.9549

                                   iPhone and, potentially, halt the Apple stock rally. In this column, I’ll focus on the latter theme. Let’s start with an Apple chart and then explore fundamental, quantitative, sentiment and ownership factors. Apple chart Please click here for the annotated Apple chart. Note the following from the chart. • The chart shows that the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is in overbought territory. A number over 70 is considered overbought. • Even though RSI is overbought, it is still below the peak reached last time. In the present context, it means Apple’s upward momentum can continue. • Apple’s stock has jumped over 50% from the last major low. Historically, it is common for stocks to rise more than 50%, take out “stops” of short sellers, hit targets of long investors, turn non-believers into believers and make a further move to about 60% from the last major low. As of this writing, Apple’s stock is almost at that 60% point. • After about a 60% move, there is usually a retracement. • Apple’s stock has rallied 24% in the first quarter of 2017. • The chart shows that Apple is approaching 138.2% Fibonacci extension from the last retracement. Strong stocks often pull back from this Fibonacci extension. • Those who are uninitiated might call Fibonacci voodoo. Before doing so, note from the chart that the last retracement in Apple’s stock stopped at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and then bounced over 50%. As a note of caution, there is an epidemic of investors being taught to use technical analysis in a manner that worked in years past but doesn’t any longer. It is important to use technical analysis correctly.

                                   and hold a Galaxy S8 in your hand. Use it with one hand and note the ease of use. Check out the huge, gorgeous display. Samsung has accomplished this remarkable feat by ditching the conventional aspect ratio of 16:9 and replacing with an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. That makes the phone narrow and easy to hold. The phone also has extremely narrow bezels. The screen is gorgeous because it has OLED (organic light-emitting diodes) and also Quad HD (four times the definition of standard high-definition), which means a resolution of 2,960 X 1,440. Impact on iPhone Based on past data, there will be limited switchovers from the Apple iPhone to the Galaxy S8 in the U.S., but it will be more pronounced in India and China. However, this will not change the earnings numbers for Apple in a meaningful way. Quantitative factors Quantitatively, Apple’s stock is now significantly more expensive than its own past valuations, but is still less expensive than many other consumer stocks. Sentiment Sentiment is most useful as a contrary indicator; please see Mark Hulbert’s articles on MarketWatch. An extreme positive sentiment is actually a negative for a stock. According to our proprietary indicators, sentiment on Apple shares is very positive but not extreme at this time. Over-owned Pre-split, when Apple’s stock topped $700, which turned out to be the exact top, I published a “sell” signal on Apple on MarketWatch. The stock fell over $300 within hours. You can see the signal in the “smart money” selling Apple. The signal was given based on Apple stock being over owned at that time. When a stock is over-owned, there are not many buyers left to propel it further. As of this writing, Apple shares are approaching over-owned levels, but it’s not there yet. iPhone 8 Apple’s stock will be supported by rumors of the iPhone 8. What to do now The sum total of the foregoing is that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is likely to dent the momentum in Apple’s stock rally but won’t hurt it badly. The most important question for investors is: “What does one do with Apple’s stock?” Please note from the chart that our target for Apple is still much higher, and we are still holding a partial position bought at $18.71. The stock is now trading over $140. Our call is to continue to hold Apple stock if it has not become a significant overweight in your portfolio. If it has, trim it a little. For those not in Apple stock and are sophisticated enough to look for high risk-adjusted returns, the prudent course of action is to wait for a pullback into the buy zone that we provide, even at the cost of missing further gains.

591,,4132017,Reuters,4062017,"The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity. The network is widely considered to be a multibillion dollar opportunity, and wireless carriers do not have many acquisition targets that would give them the type of spectrum they need in preparation for the roll out. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications. The No.2 U.S. wireless carrier said it would offer $95.63 per share, a premium of 162.1 percent over Straight Path’s close on Friday. Straight Path’s shares rose to $91.32 in afternoon trade, while AT&T’s shares were marginally lower. Earlier this year, AT&T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights. It expects that deal to close by next January. In February, Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said it had closed on its acquisition of XO Communications’ fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion, giving it access to millimeter wave spectrum. Between FiberTower and Straight Path, AT&T should have a similar amount of spectrum as Verizon if not more, said Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, in a note on Monday. Dish as well as Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use its spectrum for 5G purposes, are considered potential acquisition targets by industry analysts. Ligado is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, sources told Reuters in March. Straight Path had said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets. The company had also agreed in January to pay the FCC $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that it had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses. The tax-free deal, valued at $1.6 billion in total, includes liabilities and amounts to be remitted to the FCC, according to the January settlement terms. It is expected to close within a year, pending FCC review. The deal with AT&T is supported by Straight Path’s majority shareholder, Howard Jonas, who has entered into a voting agreement with the carrier in support of the transaction. Evercore advised Straight Path on the deal and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP provided legal counsel, while AT&T was advised by Moelis & Co and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP. ","

The details released on Thursday removed some uncertainty in the market on how Comcast would price and roll out its service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile. Comcast shares closed 2.1 percent higher at $38.13. Comcast is moving into wireless as cable companies seek to add more services to reduce customer churn, or attrition, as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast’s service will launch on Verizon’s airwaves as part of a 2011 agreement between the two companies. It will allow customers to switch automatically to Comcast’s Wi-Fi hotspots from 4G LTE. Comcast will limit the service’s rollout to customers within its footprint, which includes major markets like Philadelphia and Chicago. It will initially be available only to subscribers with Xfinity broadband service. Comcast had roughly 25 million high-speed Internet customers in 2016, according to a filing. It did not state its investment in Xfinity Mobile or the expected return. Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said in a meeting with analysts on Thursday that the service would be cash flow positive over time. Analysts at JPMorgan wrote in January that building a wireless business could cost Comcast hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the first few years, potentially cutting as much as 5 cents to 10 cents off earnings per share in 2017. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a note earlier this week that Comcast’s agreement with Verizon was merely a way to enter the market. “Comcast will secure far better economics in wireless in time, either through a network sharing arrangement with or an acquisition of one or more carriers,” he said.

593,,4132017,Reuters,4062017,"The FCC said 175 broadcast stations were selling airwaves to 50 wireless and other telecommunications companies. Companies plan to use the spectrum to build new networks or improve existing coverage. The spectrum auction’s end is widely expected to kick off a wave of deal-making in the telecom industry. Until now, companies participating in the auction have been restrained by a quiet period, but that will end after April 27, when down payments are due from auction winners. “What is most interesting to us was (Verizon) was nowhere to be found,” Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a research note, adding that “we continue to believe Verizon’s interests lay in the higher band spectrum assets.” Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email that there were three surprises in the results: “Comcast bought less than expected, Dish Network bought more, and Verizon bought nothing at all.” Dish shares fell 2.5 percent to close at $62.38. Comcast, Verizon and AT&T were down less than 1 percent at market close while T-Mobile rose marginally. Moffett said Dish’s spectrum spending underscored “the growing importance of the company’s valuation as it relates to their spectrum holdings.” Comcast sold spectrum from three of its NBCUniversal owned stations in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for $481.6 million. The FCC also announced new channel assignments for 957 non-winning stations that must change channels to clear the new wireless airwaves for use. Of the $19.8 billion bid, more than $7 billion will go to reduce the U.S. deficit and $10.05 billion to broadcasters relinquishing spectrum. Up to $1.75 billion will go to  broadcasters that incur costs in changing channels. Sellers had initially sought $86.4 billion for 126 megahertz. Many analysts had expected broadcasters to earn more and sell more spectrum. ","

594,,4132017,Reuters,4062017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advocates of landmark net neutrality rules on Friday blasted Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai’s plans to roll back the Obama era legal framework. Reuters and other outlets reported late Thursday that Pai told major telecommunications trade groups of his plans Tuesday to replace 2015 net neutrality rules with voluntary agreements to adopt open internet principles. The 2015 rules prevented broadband providers from giving or selling speedy or so-called fastlane access to some internet services over others. Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, opposes the rules approved by the FCC which gave the agency strong legal control over broadband providers, treating them much like utilities. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said if the reports are accurate “we are gearing up for a battle that could eviscerate the widely supported open Internet protections.” The rules “were built on a record of more than four million comments, and demonstrated that a free and open internet is at the very heart of our American democracy,” she added. Chris Lewis, vice president at Public Knowledge said Pai could “give dominant cable and telecommunications companies what their DC lobbyists have dreamed of for years: voluntary net neutrality ‘rules’ where consumer protection is no more than ‘trust your cable or internet provider.’” The FCC declined to comment. Pai wants to introduce new regulations under which internet providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc would voluntarily agree in their terms of service to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content. The move would allow the Federal Trade Commission to enforce compliance with the new rules. Internet providers do not oppose net neutrality principles, but opposed the decision to reclassify internet service under a law that subjects them to potential utility style regulation. Pai is expected to unveil his proposal as early as April 27, with an initial vote planned for either May or June, sources told Reuters. The proposal would be open for public comment before the FCC could finalize it. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents major internet companies like Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Crop, and strongly supports net neutrality, will meet with Pai on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said. The group declined to comment. ","

The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets that they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity.

Straight Path's shares leaped 150 percent to near $91 a share in afternoon trade, while AT&T's shares were marginally lower. Millimeter wave spectrum is expected to play a large role in 5G.

Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) wireless phone service plans have been in the works for a long time, but it finally revealed some details last week. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile service will be available to Comcast's cable and internet customers later this year. The service relies on an MVNO agreement with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), made as part of a wireless spectrum sale completed in 2011. So, Xfinity Mobile customers will be using the same wireless network as Verizon customers. The new wireless service will give Comcast the opportunity to offer the quadruple-play bundle: internet, cable, home phone, and wireless. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon are the only competitors to offer similar bundles. The more services customers take in a bundle, the less likely they are to cancel any of them. Comcast's pricing is designed to primarily benefit its core cable business by improving subscriber retention through bundling. At the same time, that strategy has the potential to steal away non-bundled AT&T and Verizon wireless customers. Image source: Comcast. The most glaring limitation of Xfinity Mobile is its limited market base of Comcast's existing customers. As Comcast's cable footprint is limited to certain markets, it doesn't represent a major threat to the nationwide wireless carriers right out of the gate. Additionally, its best pricing is reserved for its best X1 customers, which management says comprises just 25% of its customer base. All other customers have to pay more. Here's how Comcast's unlimited data plan pricing stacks up with AT&T and Verizon's. Xfinity Mobile(Best X1) Xfinity Mobile(other customers) Verizon AT&T Unlimited Plus 1 Line $45 $65 $80 $90 2 Lines $90 $130 $140 $145 3 Lines $135 $195 $160 $165 4 Lines $180 $260 $180 $185 5 Lines $225 $325 $200 $205 Data sources: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T. As you can see, Comcast's pricing is competitive, but it doesn't provide much value for larger family plans unless you bundle it with Comcast's preferred X1 packages. As such, Xfinity Mobile will likely appeal to Comcast's most valuable customers. On the flip side, it won't appeal to Verizon or AT&T's most valuable customers -- large family plan subscribers. Xfinity Mobile, at least in this first iteration, is about helping Comcast hold onto its video and internet subscribers. Since AT&T acquired DirecTV, it's now able to offer television, phone, and wireless service nationwide. The carrier offers a $25 discount on its Unlimited Plus plan for DirecTV and DirecTV Now subscribers. Comcast customers that subscribe to AT&T for wireless service are especially susceptible to that kind of promotion. Xfinity Mobile provides an opportunity for Comcast to get customers to switch from AT&T's wireless service to Comcast and stick with their current cable TV plan. It's now at least a two-way street. That's notable for AT&T investors as the telephone company has struggled to add video subscribers. Last quarter, DirecTV Now accounted for over 100% of its net additions; satellite and U-Verse combined for a net loss of 25,000 subscribers. Stealing video customers away from Comcast through bundling was one way to offset subscriber losses. Comcast also offers a pay-by-the-gigabyte option for subscribers. Customers can pay $12 per GB, and they only have to pay for the data they use. Considering most people use less than 5 GB of data per month, and Comcast has 16 million WiFi hotspots to offload additional data, many customers could save money by going a la carte with their data. What's more, Comcast allows customers to switch to the unlimited plan mid-month, so it's effectively capping the per-gigabyte plan at $65 per month (for about 5.5 GB of data or more). The catch is, the offer is still limited to Comcast's customers and not available nationwide. Comcast does own the rights to stream some cable networks nationwide, and it could launch a streaming TV competitor, so it's not out of the question that Xfinity Mobile could eventually become a nationwide product. If it did, it would become a much bigger threat to traditional wireless carriers. Even so, the a-la-carte pricing appeals to lower value customers at AT&T and Verizon. While it may cut into subscriber numbers, it won't affect their bottom lines nearly as much as would stealing away large families on unlimited data plans (a segment where both AT&T and Verizon are able to match or undercut Comcast's pricing). Xfinity Mobile isn't a big threat to Verizon or AT&T, but it could somewhat slow gross additions for both companies' wireless services as well as AT&T's television services. Another competitive force in the wireless market isn't great news for the telecom giants, but it's nothing to be too concerned about, either. ","
      
    Is Comcast's New Wireless Service a Threat to AT&T and Verizon? -- The Motley Fool

601,Daniel B. Kline,4132017,Fool,4062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. After much speculation, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has entered the wireless space with a new service that takes advantage of its Wi-Fi network, while piggybacking on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) network when needed. Called Xfinity Mobile, the service will only be offered, at least at first, in markets the company already serves with cable and internet. Comcast is not looking to directly take on the national carriers, including Verizon, AT&T (NYSE:T), Sprint (NYSE:S), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). Instead, it's hoping to tighten its hold on its customer base by offering them one more product to bundle with cable and internet service. That's a strategy AT&T and Verizon have used as well, while Sprint and T-Mobile have stuck with being lower-priced wireless-only players. ""Our goal is to improve loyalty and drive customer growth,"" Comcast Mobile President Greg Butz told CNET, also noting that being in the wireless game could change the company's less-than-stellar reputation. ""We see this as a halo to let customers think about cable differently."" Comcast promised, in the service's launch press release, to provide consumers with a ""better wireless experience, for less money."" Those are bold claims for a company that scored below industry averages as a pay television and internet service provider (ISP) in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) report (registration required). To be fair, Comcast did improve its ACSI ratings in 2016, climbing by 15% in pay TV while showing a 5% jump as an ISP. It's fair to say that Comcast is now just one of the most-hated companies in America, which is better than being alone with that designation. Its ACSI ratings of 62 (pay TV), 59 (internet), and 64 (land-line phone) place it well behind T-Mobile's 74, AT&T's 71, Verizon's 71, and Sprint's 70 in the wireless category. Comcast customers will also need to buy a phone. Image source: Getty Images. Comcast's goal is to make it more attractive for consumers to get all of its services by offering the best deals for customers who bundle more products. In the case of Xfinity Mobile, the cheapest priced unlimited deal is reserved for customers who subscribe to its ""best X1 packages,"" according to a press release. Comcast is selling its new wireless service at two different unlimited price points, and on a per gigabyte basis. It is also offering a very limited amount of free service. The first two offers sound nice, but 100 MB of data is an effectively useless deal, unless you are the type of person who only uses your phone for talking and texting or you want a phone just for emergencies. It's a proposition that may not work for many customers, but could have appeal to the older cable audience. The $12 per GB deal is similarly limited, though it might be a good offer for customers who use their phone mostly for calls The unlimited deals, however, beat Verizon's and AT&T's prices at least for the first two lines, and the single $45 line for top-tier existing X1 customers is the lowest unlimited price offered by any major carrier. Sprint currently has the lowest price for unlimited talk, text, and data service among the four major carriers, albeit through a limited-time offer for new customers. The No. 4 carrier charges $50 a month for one line, $80 for the second, $100 for the third, and $120 if you need four lines. T-Mobile comes in second at $70 for the first line, $100 for two, $140 for three, and $160 for four, but the Un-carrier does not charge any additional taxes or fees to its customers, while all the other carriers do. AT&T and Verizon would both be more expensive than the $65 per line, per month Comcast plan for the first two lines, but a better deal if you need at least three. In the $45 Xfinity Mobile category, Comcast offers better pricing for three lines at $135 a month than T-Mobile ($140), Verizon ($160), and AT&T ($165). Once you get to four lines with the Xfinity $45 deal, the Comcast product is cheaper than AT&T, tied with Verizon, and as noted above, pricier than T-Mobile and Sprint. Image source: Sprint. Comcast's pricing is set up to do exactly what the company said it wants to do. It's designed to make consumers consider upgrading their internet package in order to receive the best pricing if they also want wireless. In addition, the pricing should be attractive to existing customers already on the higher X1 tiers, tying them even closer to the brand, making it harder for them to leave. It's hard to see this offer tempting too many people away from Sprint or T-Mobile, but some of Comcast's best customers might find the savings worth it if they have AT&T or Verizon. Consumers are likely to be skeptical of Xfinity Mobile, which the the company said will be available ""soon,"" especially given Comcast's history of advertising one price, then pushing the actual cost higher with fees. This new service looks like a good deal for some Comcast subscribers, but even they should wait until the company actually takes signups to see what the potential hidden costs may be. ","

Dividend investors gravitate to high-yielding stocks like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), which have demonstrated a history of being generous with shareholders. Yet the two companies face much different conditions in their respective industries, and both have to deal with challenges that could have an adverse impact on their growth in the future despite having plenty of opportunities as well. For those who want to decide whether Altria or Verizon is the smarter pick right now, comparing the two stocks on a number of metrics can shed some light and help you make a better choice. Of these two stocks, only Altria has managed to give shareholders solid returns recently. The tobacco giant has produced gains of 17% over the past year. By contrast, Verizon has seen its stock fall since April 2016, and even on a total return basis, the telecom company has lost 2%. Image source: Verizon. A look at the valuations of the two stocks creates some confusion if you don't look beyond headline numbers. On a trailing basis, Altria looks like the cheaper stock, trading at less than 10 times earnings over the past 12 months. By contrast, Verizon trades at a higher trailing multiple of 15. Yet the backward-looking figures for Altria include a big one-time gain related to the sale of its interest in SABMiller. On a forward-looking basis, the two stocks switch positions, and Altria looks more expensive, with a forward multiple of more than 20. Verizon weighs in at just 12 times forward earnings, giving it the nod in terms of sustainable valuation. With respect to dividends, Verizon has a key advantage. The stock currently yields 4.75%, which dramatically outpaces the 3.4% yield Altria has right now. In terms of sustainability, both Altria and Verizon have similar profiles. Verizon has historically had lower payout ratios than Altria, but the telecom giant has seen that number trend higher as it goes through its business cycle. Again, Altria's payout ratio is artificially low based on extraordinary items in its earnings, but on a forward basis, both appear to weigh in around 70% to 80%. Altria has been more generous than Verizon in providing dividend growth. For instance, Altria's most recent boost to its payout was 8%, and its annual increases go back nearly half a century when you adjust for spinoffs. By contrast, Verizon's latest increase amounted to just 2%, and that's more in line with what the telecom company has traditionally done for shareholders. On the dividend front, Verizon and Altria both have pros and cons about which investors can reasonably disagree. As companies with long histories, Altria and Verizon have had plenty of growth opportunities, but they also face the challenges of being industry leaders. For Verizon, immense competition among wireless carriers has forced the company to offer large incentives in order to keep existing subscribers and attract new ones. The payoff has been less than stellar, with the company reporting nearly two-thirds fewer new phone subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2016 than it did in the previous year's fourth quarter. Operating margin figures have plunged because of the incentives, putting pressure on Verizon's bottom line. Verizon is hopeful that those trends will reverse as replacement cycles occur, but strategic moves from wireless rivals could throw a wrench into those expectations going forward. Altria, meanwhile, continues to balance falling cigarette volume against price increases to keep revenue and profit moving higher. In February, the company said it expects earnings growth for 2017 to come in between 7.5% and 9.5%, which is in line with Altria's historical target. However, new challenges are on the horizon, including a newly imposed $2 per pack increase in the cigarette tax in California, which is a key market for Altria and its tobacco industry peers. Moreover, the looming merger of rival Reynolds American with international industry player British American Tobacco could result in new competitive pressures for Altria. On the opportunity side, efforts to promote reduced-risk products have picked up substantially, and some believe the market for cigarette alternatives like heated-tobacco products could eventually become larger than Altria's core cigarette business. Those promises are likely a long way off, but efforts to move forward are putting Altria in position to reap rewards as the industry evolves. The greater growth prospects for Altria right now justify a somewhat higher valuation, but many investors will prefer Verizon's higher dividend yield and exposure to the cutting-edge wireless network industry. Neither stock is a slam-dunk winner right now, with both having pluses and minuses that could sway investors in different directions. ","

603,Andrew Tonner,4132017,Fool,4062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Telecom companies enjoy a well-earned reputation as some of the best dividend-paying stocks on the market. Unfortunately, the concentrated nature of the U.S. wireless market means there are only a handful of viable stateside options in the industry. Telecom investors looking for something slightly more exotic than blue-chip stocks like AT&T and Verizon Communications can look to international telecommunications stocks as a way to expand the number of potential opportunities while remaining exposed to the industry at large. Using this as a jumping-off point, let's review why names like Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF) are two of the best international telecom stocks for income investors today. The British telecom giant swung to a significant loss on paper in 2016, which caused Vodafone stock to underperform its benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite, by 40% over the past 12 months. However, much of the below-the-line carnage resulted from Vodafone's using deferred tax assets to turn 1.3 billion Great British Pounds (GBP) of operating profits into a net loss of GPB 3.8 billion (a $4.7 billion loss at today's current exchange rate). Companies can do this for any number of reasons, but the most common reason to intentionally swing to a net loss is to reduce income tax expenses in the near term. This is, of course, a one-time event for the company, and Vodafone is generally a profitable company. As such, investors should look at Vodafone as the international telecom equivalent of AT&T or Verizon Communications. The company generates roughly two-thirds of its revenues from Europe -- mostly Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Spain -- and the remainder of its sales come from emerging markets, notably India. Its European operations tend to be mature, slow-growing spaces. However, India represents an interesting opportunity for Vodafone and its investors. The company continues to aggressively move deeper into the rapidly expanding Indian telecom market, most recently via a deal to merge its Indian telecom subsidiary with Indian telecom operator Idea. The combined entity will create a mobile operator that will hold the first or second largest market share in 21 of India's 22 coverage regions. As a fairly mature company, Vodafone is so large today that significant revenue growth seems unlikely. However, as an established incumbent with a 5.9% dividend yield, Vodafone presents an intriguing opportunity for international telecom investors. Image source: Getty Images. Though SoftBank pays a dividend -- yielding a paltry 0.6% -- the Japanese telecom giant's continued revenue growth story plays a far more prominent role in its investing thesis than its cash distributions. Led by founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, the company has entered and exited a diverse number of industries over the years. Today, SoftBank generates the bulk of its revenues from providing telecommunications services in Japan and in the U.S., where it owns an 83% stake in Sprint. SoftBank also owns a 36% share of Yahoo! Japan -- though it controls 43% of its voting rights -- and mobile phone distributor Brightstar. The company has also demonstrated a flair for increasing its value via acquisitions and direct investments. It parlayed a $20 million investment in a then-unknow e-commerce start-up called Alibaba into a 30.25% stake in the Chinese tech heavyweight worth roughly $82 billion at its current stock price. Last year, Softbank paid $32 billion to acquire ARM Holdings, whose power-efficient semiconductor design is the standard for mobile devices worldwide. The company is also in the midst of raising a $100 billion technology investment fund. With so many different growth drivers, it should come as no surprise that SoftBank's future seems bright indeed. Sell-side analysts estimate the company's profits will increase by 67% in the current year and grow at an average annual clip of 16% over the long term. SoftBank has also generally increased its dividend, although it hasn't done so each year since it initiated dividend payments in 2012. Income investors will want to keep an eye on the company's debt burden. Though the intensive fixed-asset nature of the telecom business usually involves a lot of debt, Softbank currently sports a debt-to-equity ratio of 490%. Taken in its totality, though, SoftBank certainly deserves the attention from income investors eyeing the international telecom market because of its mix of long-term revenue growth and increasing dividends.

604,Demitrios Kalogeropoulos,4132017,Fool,4062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The stock market has had a solid 12 months, with major indexes up 15% since last April. Yet many individual stocks have enjoyed rallies of many multiples of that figure. Head-turning gains suggest dramatic improvements in the underlying business that might pave the way for continued market-beating returns for investors. Alternatively, quick, sharp spikes could set the stage for a painful decline. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at the prospects for three stocks: Sprint (NYSE:S), TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE), and SodaStream (NASDAQ:SODA), which have risen at least 150% each in the past year. TrueCar has come a long way since CEO Chip Perry took over the top spot in late 2015. Back then, executives described their latest quarter as ""a difficult one"" that ""marked the close of a challenging year."" The online automotive retailing platform had just posted a net loss of $65 million, compared to $48 million in the prior year thanks to underwhelming sales and monetization metrics. Image source: Getty Images. Its 2016 fiscal year was far stronger. Net loss shrank to $42 million as its dealer count surged and revenue growth sped back up to a double-digit pace. Lifted by this happy reversal, the stock has jumped 170% in the last year. Perry and his executive team admit that the business isn't out of the woods yet. ""We are nowhere close to declaring victory,"" he told investors in February, ""but we exited 2017 with significant velocity."" The key to the stock's future gains will be whether the company continues to march toward profitability even as sales growth stays strong. Investors will be watching for more improvements in the dealer network in 2017 as revenue rises to over $315 million from $277 million last year. Sprint shares are on fire following impressive operating results. The cellular giant recently logged its best quarterly customer additions figure in four years as it snatched market share from rivals Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). Both peers stepped up their promotions last quarter, which led to an uptick in Sprint's cancellation rate, yet the company still managed to bring in 405,000 new postpaid customers. Yet Sprint is far from profitable, having lost $923 million over the past nine months. That brutal result is entirely thanks to the company's $31 billion debt burden, though. Interest expenses amounted to $1.8 billion in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, which was enough to wipe out the $1.3 billion of operating income it managed. S Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts. For the stock to keep climbing, investors will want to see Sprint's operating cash expanding at a fast-enough pace to reduce its burdensome debt load over the coming years. After two years of brutal sales declines, at-home beverage machine maker SodaStream is back to posting solid growth. Machine sales jumped 37% last quarter thanks to a healthy mix of improved volume and higher average prices. Carbon dioxide canister sales, which is a proxy for the number of active customers, rose 10% to cross 7 million. Image source: Getty Images. Those numbers all suggest SodaStream has achieved its pivot away from a soda focus toward a sparkling water branding. The key challenge ahead is to build on that success to increase its household penetration even as traditional soda companies all fight over the fast-growing sparkling water segment. Unlike Sprint, SodaStream's business isn't groaning under the weight of hefty debt payments. And in contrast to TrueCar, this business is already profitable, having recently posted an almost quadrupling of annual net income to over $44 million. Those impressive metrics, plus the potential for increasing profitability from high-margin, recurring carbon dioxide sales, tell me that SodaStream has the best chance out of this group to produce additional market-thumping stock gains in the years ahead.

Longtime investors in streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) know that its relationship with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has been a rocky one. The two have sparred for years over a variety of issues including broadband access fees, corporate mergers, and net neutrality. In fact, many would argue that the phenomenon of cord-cutting -- customers ditching their cable subscriptions -- was the direct result of the flat-rate online video streaming service that Netflix pioneered in 2007. There has been a lot of animosity between the two over the years. In recent years, a number of secondary providers like Verizon Communications Inc. and Dish Network sought to capitalize on the trend of cord-cutters and cord-nevers -- those that never had cable or satellite -- by offering customers the option of a skinny bundle, a smaller subset of cable channels for a markedly lower price. This was an attempt to entice customers that were unwilling to pay for a full cable subscription. Netflix is winning the battle for the living room. Image source: Netflix. Several recent developments reveal that cord-cutting, skinny bundles, and the popularity of streaming services offered by Netflix and others may have finally worn down the cable colossus. Reuters is reporting that after testing the concept in several markets, Comcast will offer a slimmed-down bundle branded Xfinity Instant TV, which will provide major broadcast networks and sports channels like ESPN and Spanish language channels such as Telemundo and Univision for between $15 and $40 per month. The package will include a cloud-based DVR and be available across internet-connected devices. The report indicates that Comcast is planning to expand the service nationwide in its markets beginning in the third quarter of 2017. This is the latest in a series of events that illustrates a change of attitude by the cable behemoth. After waging a public relations battle in the media for much of 2014 over the issues of net neutrality and access fees, there has been a thawing of the chilly relations between Comcast and Netflix in recent months. In July of last year, Recode reported that Netflix would be available on the Comcast set-top box. When asked for a statement, the companies replied: Comcast and Netflix have reached an agreement to incorporate Netflix into X1, providing seamless access to the great content offered by both companies. We have much work to do before the service will be available to consumers later this year. We'll provide more details at that time. By November those plans had been realized and the companies revealed in a joint press release that Netflix would be integrated throughout Comcast's X1 platform, combining the on-demand libraries of both services in a single interface. Comcast no doubt saw that the writing was on the wall and moves such as this one could slow the migration from its services. Image source: Comcast. Comcast is pursuing other venues to bolster its position. Bloomberg is reporting that Comcast has received authorization to offer certain cable channels nationwide to customers outside its traditional markets as an online distributor. The company hasn't received permissions from every network and doesn't yet have plans to offer an online service nationwide, but if it were to offer such a service, it would compete directly with AT&T Inc.'s DIRECTV Now and Dish Networks' Sling TV. Comcast also announced late last month that Netflix would be available for free to its X1 customers from April 3-9, similar to promotions it offers for services like HBO and Starz. These recent developments are a sign of the times as these once-bitter rivals partner to offer services to customers. About 54% of U.S. households subscribe to Netflix, and Comcast has disclosed that more than 30% of its X1 customers are Netflix subscribers. With that many customers watching Netflix, Comcast may have decided, ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."" ","

Warren Buffett's stock picking skills are legendary. Thanks to his once-in-a-generation abilities, shares of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK.B) have compounded at an average annual rate of 20% per year over the past half-century. It's a track record that may never be replicated. Even at 86 years old today, Buffett remains as active as ever, though he has since added two additional portfolio managers -- Todd Combs and Ted Weschler -- to help deploy Berkshire's billions in capital. After scanning Berkshire's latest 13-F filing, names including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) stand out as particularly interesting potential investments right now. Here's why shares of these two companies make for compelling Buffett stocks to buy in April. After first being purchased by one of his investing lieutenants in 2016, Buffett spearheaded Berkshire's recent doubling-down on Apple shares. In the past few months, the Oracle increased Berkshire's Apple investment to a stake worth nearly $20 billion. And although the move breaks with his long-standing aversion to technology companies, his purchase of the Mac maker is a classic Buffett investment in virtually every other sense. I've gone to great lengths to argue the bull thesis for Apple shares in several articles as of late, so I won't provide as exhaustive of an analysis here as I might otherwise -- the accompanying links should more than get you up to speed. That said, Apple enjoys several useful catalysts that suggest its shares will continue to rise in the coming months. Apple shares tend to handily outperform the broader market in the run up to major iPhone releases. With one-third of its estimated installed base using iPhones that are more than two years old, the stage again seems set for Apple to trigger a massive upgrade cycle with the release of its reportedly redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone this fall. Despite this likely return to growth, Apple remains far cheaper than the overall market. And its overflowing cash hoard gives Apple the ability to enhance its shareholder returns through any number of potential avenues. Image source: Getty Images. Berkshire began buying shares of Twenty-First Century Fox in the fourth quarter of 2014. Berkshire's initial purchase totaled 4.75 million shares, worth $181 million at the end of the period. Berkshire has since nearly doubled its ownership stake, reporting control of 8.9 million shares in its latest 13-F, a stake of about $285 million in dollar terms. The relatively small dollar values at work here, at lest for Berkshire, suggest that one of Buffett's two investing lieutenants initiated the position. Either way, the move reflects an increasing bullishness toward media assets from Berkshire, a perspective that's understandable judging by recent trends in the industry. Consolidation has been a especially potent trend, as content producers like Twenty-First Century Fox have become acquisition targets. To this end, AT&T's pending buyout of Time Warner shows why Twenty-First Century Fox could find itself an acquisition target at some point soon. Spurring this is the fact that media distribution channels are expected to shift as new wireless standards, such as 5G, allow for ultra-fast streaming over wireless networks directly to mobile devices. Doing so will likely require so-called ""wireless bundle"" providers like AT&T to negotiate for content deals with existing cable companies, like Comcast. As such, the safest way to ensure a company like AT&T can secure rights to critical channels is to also own broadcast content that other cable providers need for their own bundles. In light of that, names like Charter Communications -- also a Berkshire holding -- or Verizon Communications could look to purchase Twenty-First Century Fox to continue this trend. This highlights what makes Twenty-First Century Fox a suitable Buffett stock. The company's durable competitive advantage is its content assets and brands, which are difficult to replicate or challenge. Regardless of your politics, it's probably safe to say that it would be virtually impossible to challenge media assets like Fox News among its constituents. In this sense, Twenty-First Century Fox seems like a classic Buffet stock to invest in at a time when content assets are in high demand. ","

                                   plans Thursday to unveil details of a service, dubbed Xfinity Mobile, that it has been preparing to launch for years. It hopes by offering four services—home internet, television, landline and wireless phone—customers will be less likely to defect. While wireless carriers are contending with slowed growth and a cutthroat price war, cable companies like Comcast are navigating a saturated pay-TV business under assault from cord-cutting and inexpensive online video options. For both, the other’s turf looks ripe for disruption. “The view is completely different if you’re an incumbent versus if you’re a challenger,” said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett. “For a challenger, all you can see is green grass and wide open spaces.” An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

609,Alan Farley,4202017,Investopedia,4132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Yahoo, Inc. (YHOO) reports earnings on Tuesday evening, with analysts expecting 14-cents per share profit on $814-million in revenues. Dow component Verizon Communications, Inc. (VZ) recently amended the terms of its agreement to buy the company’s core Internet assets, reducing the acquisition price by $350-million due to increased liabilities arising from a series of high-profile data breaches. The transaction is expected to close in the next two to three months. YHOO stock has gained more than 20% so far in 2017, with market players taking advantage of the deal’s growing optimism. VZ has struggled over the same period, falling more than 9% even though the D.J. Industrial Average has risen more than 4%. Both companies could be exposed to broader market forces between now and the finalization date when what’s left of Yahoo abandons its once iconic brand name. YHOO Weekly Chart (2006–2017) The stock split four times into the 2000 all-time high at $125.03, posting on the second trading day of the new millennium, and sold off into single digits during the Dot.com bear market, A broad recovery peaked in the low-40s (blue line) in 2006, ahead of a second descent into single digits during the  2008 economic collapse. It completed a round trip back to 2006 resistance in 2014, ahead of a breakout that added just 10-points into the November 2014 high at $52.62. It got cut in half into the February 2016 low at $26.15, ahead of a multimonth bounce that just reached resistance at the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level. A reversal is likely at or around this price zone, with the decline targeting the 2006 high and unfilled January 2017 gap between $42.50 and $43.50. Further downside is unlikely, at least in the short-term, because sellers will be hesitant to press their bets ahead of the acquisition. Traders looking to play this week’s earnings report should watch a 2-month rising channel, with support at $46 and resistance at $48. A breach at either end is likely to trigger momentum signals, with a breakout reaching $50 while a breakdown drops toward the gap. It will take a solid buying thrust above the round number to clear Fibonacci resistance and set up a test at the 2014 high. VZ Weekly Chart (2006-2017) Verizon reports earnings on Thursday, April 20. The stock rallied strongly in the 1990s, posting an all-time high at $64.75 in September 1999, just three months ahead of its future paramour. It sold off into 2002, finding support in the mid-20s while the subsequent bounce lagged broadly positive action during the mid-decade bull market. That rally ended at the 50% bear market retracement in the low-40s in 2007. The subsequent downtrend found support at the 2002 low in October 2008, ahead of a triangular basing pattern that failed to produce significant upside until the second half of 2010 when the stock broke out and entered a strong uptrend. The advance continued into the 2013 high in the low-50s and gave way to an intermediate correction that ended in the upper-30s during the August 2015 mini flash crash. The stock returned to the 2014 high in the middle of 2016 and broke out, but aggressive sellers took control immediately, generating a failure swing that could signal a long-term double top. The contested level aligns perfectly with the .786 retracement of the 1999 into 2008 downtrend, adding weight to a technical argument that the stock has already posted the highest high for this bull market cycle. Yahoo and Verizon report earnings this week, with both companies now exposed to broad market forces after finalization of their troubled fiscal union. YHOO needs to trade above 50 after earnings to attract even greater buying interest while VZ is likely to continue choppy action around the same price, following 2016’s failed breakout. <Disclosure: the author held no positions in aforementioned stocks at the time of publication.> ","Yahoo Earnings Overshadowed by Verizon Deal (YHOO, VZ) | Investopedia",0.7579
610,Lauren Thomas,4202017,CNBC,4132017,"Verizon Communications reported first-quarter earnings and sales on Thursday that missed analysts' expectations, sending shares lower. Here's what the company reported versus what the Street was expecting: The stock closed down more than 1 percent on Thursday. Total revenues for Verizon's wireless business were $20.9 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 5.1 percent from one year ago, which was largely due to decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid customers in the quarter and continued promotional activity, Verizon said. Verizon also reported a net decline of 307,000 retail postpaid connections, or those who are bound by contracts, including 289,000 phone losses. The telecom company said it added a net of 35,000 Fios internet connections, missing quarterly estimates, and it lost a net of 13,000 Fios video connections for the period. ""... we extended our wireless and fiber network capabilities, began offering an unlimited pricing option and expanded our opportunities in new markets,"" Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in a statement, commenting on the latest quarter. ""We're executing on strategies to capture future growth ..."" Verizon said it completed its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber assets earlier this year, part of its plan to expand its cell network. On Thursday, the company predicted its full-year 2017 sales to be ""fairly consistent"" with those in 2016, with improvements being made in wireless service revenue and equipment revenue trends. Verizon's 2017 effective tax rate should fall within a range of 34 to 36 percent, the company said, which would exclude any impacts from the Trump administration's potential tax reform. The telecom giant's much-talked-about acquisition of Marissa Mayer's Yahoo is still pending, complicated by the two data breaches that Yahoo announced last year, which affected up to 1.5 billion users throughout 2013 and 2014. The companies initially agreed to a $4.8 billion deal, but in February, Verizon lowered the price to $4.48 billion, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this week, amid heightened dealmaking activity in the telecom sector, Verizon CEO McAdam said he is open to discussing the possibility of merging his company with Disney, CNBC owner Comcast, or CBS, according to Bloomberg. Referring to Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts, McAdam told Bloomberg: ""If Brian came knocking on the door, I'd have a discussion with him about it."" ""... if there is the right opportunity out there to accelerate [Verizon's] strategy organically in a way that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities,"" Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis explained McAdam's comments in a conference call Thursday. ""We are committed to remain the largest and most reliable 4G network ... As part of the densification, we are deepening our fiber assets as seen by the XO transaction"" and continuing to focus on ""organic"" growth, for now, Ellis added. The CFO said he's confident wireless subscriber growth will reach a positive trajectory later in the year and into 2018, so long as Verizon keeps prices at the ""right levels"" and works on stepping customers up.

611,Lauren Thomas,4202017,CNBC,4132017,"Verizon Communications announced a deal Tuesday that will further its commitments to growing its wireless broadband network nationwide, as the landscape for telecom companies only becomes more competitive and crowded. The agreement calls for Corning, a New York-based manufacturer of materials primarily for industrial and scientific applications, to provide up to 12.4 million miles of optical fiber each year for Verizon to purchase starting in 2018 and lasting until 2020, with a minimum purchase commitment of $1.05 billion. ""This new architecture is designed to improve Verizon's 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G, and deliver high-speed broadband to homes and businesses of all sizes,"" Verizon said in a statement. Verizon launched One Fiber, what has been called a more ""nontraditional Fios build"" for the company, in Boston last year. On its website, Verizon describes Fios as giving consumers ""a 100 percent fiber-optic network that allows you to enjoy the internet speed you crave, the TV channels you love and a home phone that's reliable."" ""Our plans [in Boston] identified a shortfall in fiber supply, and Verizon has been working with business teams to forecast demand and fill supply gaps with existing suppliers,"" Verizon Chief Supply Chain Officer Viju Menon said in a statement. ""Securing the required volume of optical fiber and hardware solutions with Corning will ensure we meet our planned rollout schedules."" Verizon said Tuesday it's been ""reinventing"" a network architecture of late — one that supports a ""next-generation fiber platform"" to support all of its business segments.

612,Lauren Thomas,4202017,CNBC,4132017,"T-Mobile said it's only fitting that competitor Verizon Communications released its quarterly earnings on ""the holiest of high days,"" April 20. ""After all, this is the same company that's made questionable decisions one after the other for the past four years and now finds itself losing customers to T-Mobile on a regular basis"" the company wrote in a blog post Thursday morning. ""There's really only one explanation,"" T-Mobile went on in its blog post. ""Verizon has been #VerHIGHzon this whole time."" T-Mobile CEO John Legere chimed in by blasting the company on Twitter with his creative hashtag. @JohnLegere: Every time @

VerHIGHzon @JohnLegere: How does @verizon even lose this badly?! Oh..I know…they were #VerHIGHzon ""We like puppy memes too,"" Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni told CNBC in an email. ""But today, like every day, we're focused on improving America's most reliable network. We're also busy enhancing our network to handle 3D, virtual reality and holographic puppy memes."" Verizon reported first-quarter earnings and sales before the bell Thursday, both of which missed Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. Investors were further concerned with the company's unexpected loss in wireless customers for the period, coupled with a decline in wireless revenue. T-Mobile said it will be updating its blog post throughout the day with memes and content, ""trying to make sense of #VerHIGHzon.""

""As we enter our final quarter as an independent company, we are committed to finishing strong and planning for the best possible integration with Verizon,"" Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in a statement. ""With the transaction anticipated to complete in June, I've never been more proud of the improvements we've made to the business and the value we've delivered to our shareholders."" Yahoo said revenue from Mavens — the mobile, video, native and social advertising units that it has touted as key emerging businesses — rose 35.6 percent to $529 million in the first quarter ended March 31. Net income attributable to Yahoo was $99.4 million, or 10 cents per share in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $99.2 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.33 billion from $1.09 billion. Verizon in February agreed to buy Yahoo's core business — which includes its internet search and email assets — for $4.48 billion, lowering its original offer by $350 million, in the wake of two massive cyber attacks at the internet company.

    Verizon Loses Postpaid Wireless Customers for the First Time -- The Motley Fool

618,Adam Levy,4202017,Fool,4132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently announced the results of the first incentive spectrum auction. The auction reallocated radio airwaves previously controlled by broadcast television stations to telecom companies to support their wireless data networks. But one telecom company that won't be getting any of that spectrum is Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The company failed to place any winning bids in the auction. The FCC auction specifically reallocated the 600 MHz band of airwaves, which are well suited for covering large areas and penetrating buildings. While Verizon holds a good amount of spectrum in that band already, it's surprising the company wasn't more aggressive in the auction. That's particularly true in light of its recent decision to offer a new unlimited data plan to its sizable retail wireless customer base. Verizon may be more interested in trying its hand in the mergers and acquisition market, where it can use stock to help finance its purchases. It may face competition from AT&T (NYSE:T), which was also relatively inactive in the auction, spending less than $1 billion. Image source: Verizon Verizon has historically been very active in the FCC's spectrum auctions. In 2008, the carrier spent $9.4 billion for 700 MHz spectrum, which has very similar characteristics to the 600 MHz spectrum the FCC just sold. In 2015, Verizon spent another $10.3 billion on the FCC's AWS-3 mid-band spectrum (high 1000s MHz to low 2000s MHz) auction. Verizon has also bought spectrum on the private market. It bought a bunch of AWS licenses in 2011 for $3.6 billion from a group of cable television companies. That $3.6 billion is in addition to offering an option to activate an MVNO agreement at lower-than-usual rates. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) recently took advantage of that agreement with the launch of Xfinity Mobile. Verizon's decision to sit on the sidelines while smaller carriers snatched up the spectrum may be because the company doesn't think it needs any more low-band spectrum (sub-1000 MHz). The upcoming 5G network will run on high-band spectrum, which is capable of delivering very high data speeds, but over relatively short distances. Verizon is working to beat the competition to market with its 5G network. Verizon owns 46.2 MHz in the low-band spectrum range. That's still more than T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), which just bought 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band. T-Mobile's total will climb to 41.1 MHz after it closes its purchases. That includes some 700 MHz spectrum T-Mobile bought from Verizon in 2014. That deal was another indication that Verizon is set with its low-band spectrum holdings. But Verizon's customer base is around twice the size of T-Mobile's. AT&T, which has a similarly sized customer base, owns 70.5 MHz of low-band spectrum. With the launch of a new unlimited data plan, Verizon's network could suffer if it doesn't do something. In all likelihood, Verizon will be very active in merger and acquisition talks in the following weeks. It's already reportedly interested in outbidding AT&T for Straight Path Communications. AT&T agreed to pay $1.6 billion for the company, which holds high-band spectrum licenses useful for a 5G network. Rumors have circulated for a while that Verizon may be interested in buying Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) or otherwise gaining access to its growing trove of spectrum licenses. Dish was an active bidder in the recent auction, spending $6.2 billion. The satellite TV company owns a variety of spectrum licenses in the low-band and mid-band ranges. Dish may be interested in selling the spectrum licenses in exchange for cash and an MVNO agreement along the lines of the one Verizon offered Comcast and other cable companies in 2011. Verizon has a few options, but none of them will be particularly cheap. Investors should pay attention to what deals Verizon makes, and how it structures those deals to manage its debt and balance it with cash flows. ","

Tuesday night, online information portal Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Here's what you need to know. Metric Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $1.33 billion $1.09 billion 22% Net income $99 million ($99 million) N/A GAAP earnings per share (diluted) $0.10 ($0.10) N/A Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Data for the first quarter of 2017 in the table above includes changes to Yahoo!'s accounting presentation of the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) search agreement. Traffic acquisition costs for this contract are now treated as a reduction to revenue rather than a cost of sales. These changes have been in place since the second quarter of 2016, but they played no part in calculating results in the year-ago period used here. Without the presentation change, Yahoo!'s first-quarter sales would have fallen 6% to $1.02 billion. The new policy does not affect results below the gross income line of the income statement. Highlights from the quarter include: With the pending buyout by Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) due to close in June, management declined to provide any forward-looking guidance targets. The company also skipped the traditional earnings call with Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images. In its press release, Yahoo! noted business updates including doubling the number of users enrolled in Yahoo Account Key, which lets users sign in more easily from their mobile phone; launching a newly designed Yahoo Homepage; and launching Captain, a ""mobile bot assistant to help users manage lists and reminders, and coordinate family or group activities."" In a prepared statement, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer celebrated a ""solid"" quarter before turning her sights on the soon-to-close Verizon deal.

Big Red has relied on its brand strength and strong retention of valuable postpaid subscribers to defend itself, and has only made modest concessions in response to T-Mobile's various Un-carrier initiatives, which now number over a dozen different moves to upend the industry. Verizon's latest reactive effort was relaunching unlimited data plans in February, which were still priced at a premium relative to T-Mobile One. T-Mobile management on an earnings call. Image source: T-Mobile. For what it's worth, Verizon says that Verizon Unlimited helped mitigate some of the customer losses in the first quarter; it ended up losing 307,000 net postpaid customers, but would have lost 398,000 if it weren't for Verizon Unlimited. Never one to let up, T-Mobile poked fun at the date of Verizon's earnings release, insinuating that Verizon may have been celebrating the ""holiest of high days"" (bonus points for puppy memes). In an emailed statement to CNBC, Verizon responded: We like puppy memes too. But today, like every day, we're focused on improving America's most reliable network. We're also busy enhancing our network to handle 3D, virtual reality and holographic puppy memes. Verizon is still the market leader by far, but T-Mobile has been making incredible progress growing its customer base. Verizon closed out the first quarter with 113.9 million total retail connections. T-Mobile hasn't reported first-quarter results yet, but finished 2016 with 71.5 million total customers (including wholesale) after adding 6.6 million throughout the year. Verizon does not report wholesale connections, and for reporting purposes Verizon's ""retail"" connections are synonymous with T-Mobile's ""branded"" customers. For comparability purposes, if we stack up T-Mobile's branded net additions next to Verizon's retail net additions (excluding wholesale for both carriers), the aforementioned inflection point becomes clear: Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. The U.S. wireless market is quite mature at this point, and overall isn't really growing all that much any more in terms of connections and customers. As the market leader, it makes sense that Verizon has struggled to find growth, while T-Mobile has been growing by gaining share and stealing customers. There are still revenue growth opportunities as data consumption continues to rise, driven in large part by mobile video, and carriers attempt to monetize that increased usage. The tough part is that aggressive pricing is the key to T-Mobile's success (in addition to savvy marketing campaigns that appeal to younger demographics), which undermines efforts to increase average revenue per user (ARPU); T-Mobile's branded postpaid phone ARPU was effectively flat in the fourth quarter ($48.37). Verizon reports average revenue per account (ARPA), which includes all lines in an account, and as such isn't directly comparable with T-Mobile's ARPU metrics; Verizon ARPA was $136.98 last quarter (down 6%). Overall, the Un-carrier continues to crush it, while Big Red searches for growth elsewhere. ","

Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) wireless phone service plans have been in the works for a long time, but it finally revealed some details last week. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile service will be available to Comcast's cable and internet customers later this year. The service relies on an MVNO agreement with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), made as part of a wireless spectrum sale completed in 2011. So, Xfinity Mobile customers will be using the same wireless network as Verizon customers. The new wireless service will give Comcast the opportunity to offer the quadruple-play bundle: internet, cable, home phone, and wireless. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon are the only competitors to offer similar bundles. The more services customers take in a bundle, the less likely they are to cancel any of them. Comcast's pricing is designed to primarily benefit its core cable business by improving subscriber retention through bundling. At the same time, that strategy has the potential to steal away non-bundled AT&T and Verizon wireless customers. Image source: Comcast. The most glaring limitation of Xfinity Mobile is its limited market base of Comcast's existing customers. As Comcast's cable footprint is limited to certain markets, it doesn't represent a major threat to the nationwide wireless carriers right out of the gate. Additionally, its best pricing is reserved for its best X1 customers, which management says comprises just 25% of its customer base. All other customers have to pay more. Here's how Comcast's unlimited data plan pricing stacks up with AT&T and Verizon's. Xfinity Mobile(Best X1) Xfinity Mobile(other customers) Verizon AT&T Unlimited Plus 1 Line $45 $65 $80 $90 2 Lines $90 $130 $140 $145 3 Lines $135 $195 $160 $165 4 Lines $180 $260 $180 $185 5 Lines $225 $325 $200 $205 Data sources: Comcast, Verizon, AT&T. As you can see, Comcast's pricing is competitive, but it doesn't provide much value for larger family plans unless you bundle it with Comcast's preferred X1 packages. As such, Xfinity Mobile will likely appeal to Comcast's most valuable customers. On the flip side, it won't appeal to Verizon or AT&T's most valuable customers -- large family plan subscribers. Xfinity Mobile, at least in this first iteration, is about helping Comcast hold onto its video and internet subscribers. Since AT&T acquired DirecTV, it's now able to offer television, phone, and wireless service nationwide. The carrier offers a $25 discount on its Unlimited Plus plan for DirecTV and DirecTV Now subscribers. Comcast customers that subscribe to AT&T for wireless service are especially susceptible to that kind of promotion. Xfinity Mobile provides an opportunity for Comcast to get customers to switch from AT&T's wireless service to Comcast and stick with their current cable TV plan. It's now at least a two-way street. That's notable for AT&T investors as the telephone company has struggled to add video subscribers. Last quarter, DirecTV Now accounted for over 100% of its net additions; satellite and U-Verse combined for a net loss of 25,000 subscribers. Stealing video customers away from Comcast through bundling was one way to offset subscriber losses. Comcast also offers a pay-by-the-gigabyte option for subscribers. Customers can pay $12 per GB, and they only have to pay for the data they use. Considering most people use less than 5 GB of data per month, and Comcast has 16 million WiFi hotspots to offload additional data, many customers could save money by going a la carte with their data. What's more, Comcast allows customers to switch to the unlimited plan mid-month, so it's effectively capping the per-gigabyte plan at $65 per month (for about 5.5 GB of data or more). The catch is, the offer is still limited to Comcast's customers and not available nationwide. Comcast does own the rights to stream some cable networks nationwide, and it could launch a streaming TV competitor, so it's not out of the question that Xfinity Mobile could eventually become a nationwide product. If it did, it would become a much bigger threat to traditional wireless carriers. Even so, the a-la-carte pricing appeals to lower value customers at AT&T and Verizon. While it may cut into subscriber numbers, it won't affect their bottom lines nearly as much as would stealing away large families on unlimited data plans (a segment where both AT&T and Verizon are able to match or undercut Comcast's pricing). Xfinity Mobile isn't a big threat to Verizon or AT&T, but it could somewhat slow gross additions for both companies' wireless services as well as AT&T's television services. Another competitive force in the wireless market isn't great news for the telecom giants, but it's nothing to be too concerned about, either. ","

Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) investors were greeted last week by the news that AT&T (NYSE:T) planned to purchase the small company for a total transaction cost of $1.6 billion. Proceeds to Straight Path shareholders would be $1.25 billion, or $95.63 per share, payable in AT&T stock. That's over a 200% premium from the previous Friday's close, and a massive 1,500% increase since IDT spun off the company back in 2013. Straight Path's stock closed last Thursday at $91.70 and this was followed by an SEC filing by the company noting that it had received interest from another party that was considering topping AT&T's offer. Investors jumped in when the market reopened Monday and had pushed the stock up to $106 by 2:30 p.m. Rumor has it Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is the second bidder. STRP data by YCharts While the AT&T deal, and any one topping it, will be a boon for Straight Path owners, it also has relevancy for other investors betting on the future of wireless communications. The race to launch the next-generation 5G network is heating up and is worth consideration. Image source: AT&T. That will be accomplished by expanding the network's reach. Part of the conversation around 5G has been the use of small cells, referring to localized wireless access points. Historically, wireless connectivity has been achieved with large cell towers, but the next generation of connectivity could be brought down to the micro level, relying even on home-based routers to provide access for users. Thus, 5G could have seamless integration with Wi-Fi, expanding the reach of networks overall and providing ultra-high speeds and ultra-high reliability for the tidal wave of device connections that has been dubbed the Internet of Things. Those connections span everything from consumer electronics and vehicles to industrial and medical equipment. A wireless connectivity service that is able to accommodate all of those devices could be huge. With the IoT movement already underway, it has become a race to get that bigger and better network up and running. Straight Path owns bandwidth licenses and other intellectual property that will play a key role in the future 5G network, which is expected to begin initial rollout later this year. AT&T hopes its acquisition helps accelerate its development and expansion and supports other key purchases it has made as of late or is in the process of making.

It's beginning to look like the 5G network and the IoT will be the next catalysts for growth. The big purchases by AT&T and Verizon to speed up R&D are setting the stage for the next battle in the world of telecom. If the current trend continues, AT&T and Verizon will come to rely on big data services as their primary means of business in a few short years as a result of the move to 5G. The potential battle over Straight Path is the most recent, visible example of how the companies are trying to one-up each other. ","

Dividends aren't sexy but they are effective. While companies that offer regular payouts aren't likely to triple in value in any given year, dividends are the strong and steady force behind many retirement portfolios. Over time, such payments create dynamic wealth. Consider the two companies we are investigating today: telecom giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Over the last 25 years, their stocks have gone up 130% and 940%, respectively. But when we take dividends into account, this is what happens. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts. If I had my way, I'd jump into a time machine, grab my beginner investor self, and tell him, ""Brian, there's nothing more important to your success than picking companies with the strongest sustainable competitive advantages."" That's because these advantages, often referred to as ""moats,"" are what separate a companies from the rest of the field. They provide that special something that keeps customers coming back for more and the competition at bay for ages. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson has three different divisions, each with its own moat. The consumer division, which accounts for 18% of sales, is buoyed by the strength of the company's brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol. The medical device division -- which comprises 35% of all sales -- benefits from large installed bases and moderately high switching costs for hospitals. And biggest of all, pharmaceuticals -- pulling in 47% of all sales -- is protected by patents. It's somewhat concerning that patents only last a specific amount of time, and yet they protect almost half of the company's revenue. At the same time, the reliability of the other two divisions allows Johnson & Johnson some leeway that other pharmaceutical companies don't have. Verizon is also making inroads into becoming a content company. The acquisitions of AOL and part of Yahoo! are evidence of this. If this seems like a lot of ink spilled over the moats for these two, that's because it is. It's impossible for me to solidly declare a winner here, as both are very strong. Investors love seeing cash returned to them. But it's important to keep cash sitting in the bank, too. That's because every company will deal with tough economic times. When those times hit, companies with cash have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire competitors, or outspend them in an attempt to gain market share. Those with a lot of debt are in the opposite boat, fragilized by their tenuous obligations. In the chart below, I've adjusted Verizon's free cash flow numbers to normalize them. They were artificially lower due to the fact that the company paid a large one-time tax bill for divesting some of its business, and it changed its business model to do far less subsidizing of phone plans. Remember that Johnson & Johnson is valued 70% higher than Verizon. Here's how the two stack up: Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $4 billion $105 billion $13.1 billion $13.8 billion Johnson & Johnson $42 billion $22 billion $16.5 billion $15.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Verizon 13 14 3.0 4.8% 67%* Johnson & Johnson 19 22 2.7 2.6% 55% Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. *FCF for Verizon is adjusted for the factors mentioned above. On the face of it, Johnson & Johnson appears to be the more expensive stock, trading at a significant premium on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But the company is growing faster than Verizon as well, and trades at a 10% discount to Verizon on the PEG ratio. In the end, the differentiator is the dividend. Verizon's payout is safe and much larger than Johnson & Johnson's. So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have solid moats, Johnson & Johnson has the stronger balance sheet, and Verizon is more attractively valued. If I were forced to choose, I would side with Johnson & Johnson, as I like the company's opportunities to grow in the future, while I think Verizon's foray into content is a bit riskier. Either way, both of these companies are solid dividend payers worthy of your careful consideration. ","

Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) has seen some hard times lately. The telecommunications equipment and services veteran fell short of Wall Street's earnings estimates in three of the past four quarterly reports, slashed dividend payments by 75% in January, and saw share prices fall 33% over the past 52 weeks. Does Ericsson have a path back to profitable growth, or are the dog days here to stay? Image source: Getty Images. The Swedish company is preparing to report first-quarter results next week. In the meantime, here's a quick look at Ericsson's results in fiscal year 2016: Metric FY 2016 FY 2015 Year-over-year Change Revenue $26.0 billion $29.3 billion (11%) Net income $0.22 billion $1.62 billion (86%) Earnings per share (diluted) $0.06 $0.49 (88%) Free cash flows $0.98 billion $1.61 billion (39%) Average SEK-to-USD exchange rate $1 = 8.56 SEK $1 = 8.43 SEK 1.5% Data source: LM Ericsson. 2016 was a tough year for the telecom equipment industry in general. The 4G installation cycle is winding down, and 5G replacements are not quite ready for action yet. Network operators are consolidating on a global level, leaving fewer clients for Ericsson and its rivals to pursue. Economic uncertainties weren't inspiring networks to lighten their capital expense wallets any faster than necessary. All of these issues weighed heavy on Ericsson's sales trends and gross profits last year. The company launched new product platforms while running a cost-reduction program last year. The cost controls are said to be running on track, including the elimination of 4,800 positions or 5% of Ericsson's total workforce. ERIC data by YCharts There are a few new wrinkles to consider in the Ericsson story: Moreover, it turns out that Vestberg might have more to offer Ericsson even after leaving the company. He now works for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), in a role giving him hands-on control over that network's fiber-optic networking strategy. Ericsson is known to be working with Verizon on infrastructure for the upcoming installation of 5G standards. If that weren't enough, Vestberg is said to have a long-running friendship with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam, and is one of three high-level executives who might take over when McAdam retires. In other words, Ericsson has a pretty significant foot in the door toward winning contracts for Verizon's network upgrades. Wall Street analysts have started coming around to Ericsson's view, sparking several upgrades and rosy price targets in recent weeks. The company sports an attractive risk/reward balance at today's low share prices, especially if Ekholm can make some tough decisions and take the cost-cutting program to the next level. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch, and Ericsson has a lot of hard work to do before investors can cash in those promises. That being said, we're talking about a global leader in a cyclical but fundamentally strong industry, trading in a deep trough at the moment. I have to say that buying Ericsson today looks less like a risk and more of a value-bounce reward over the next couiple of years. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

If it wasn't for Sling TV, Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) would be bleeding subscribers. Instead, the streaming linear TV service has attracted over 1 million subscribers, helping Dish tread water with its overall subscriber numbers. At the end of 2016, Dish reported 13.67 million subscribers across its traditional satellite business and Sling TV. That's down 310,000 or so from two years ago, right before Dish launched Sling TV, but consider how much worse it would be without Sling TV. Dish Networks' management argues that it can charge so much less for Sling TV (plans start at just $20 per month) because its customer acquisition costs are so much less. There's no need to send a person over to the house to install the satellite dish, or set up in-home equipment, all of which Dish pays for upfront. Sling TV also doesn't offer loss-leading promotional short-term sign-up rates to acquire customers. But even when you factor in the savings, Sling TV customers generate about one-fourth the profit of traditional satellite customers over their lifetime. Image source: Sling TV. Annual subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber are down 25% over the last two years. In the fourth quarter, that number fell to about $536, down from about $853 in 2014. That's not entirely due to the influx of Sling TV subscribers, but multiple times throughout its annual report, management notes, ""As Sling branded pay-TV subscriber activations increase, it will have a positive impact on subscriber acquisition costs."" The trend in subscriber acquisition costs indicates that most of Dish's gross additions are Sling TV subscribers. The problem is, Sling may be cannibalizing Dish's satellite business -- i.e., customers Dish has already acquired. In that case, Dish isn't saving any money on customers switching to Sling. They're just replacing a higher revenue stream with a lower one. Analyst Craig Moffett says each time Dish replaces a satellite customer with a Sling customer, ""they forgo a future stream of contribution dollars equal to about $1,950 ... In the substitute OTT subscriber, they gain a future contribution stream worth about $325, and they incur upfront cost of about $55."" Those values are based on the average customer life for both satellite and Sling TV. Even if Dish isn't directly cannibalizing itself (with its satellite customers dropping the dish for Sling), the trend is for Sling TV subscribers replacing Dish. The effect is still the same. Several big competitors have entered or are planning to enter the streaming linear TV market. AT&T (NYSE:T) launched DirecTV Now late last year and has already attracted some 400,000 subscribers, according to one media executive. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is also interested in launching a nationwide streaming service this year. The big difference between Dish Network and AT&T and Verizon is that the latter two don't rely on video subscriptions for the bulk of their revenue. AT&T and Verizon's streaming services will support their core wireless service businesses through bundling options. There's no incentive to take other services from Dish Network with Sling TV, but AT&T incentivizes DirecTV Now Subscribers to buy into its highest-tier data plan -- Unlimited Plus. Investors can expect Verizon to do something similar. AT&T has a sizable traditional TV business with both U-Verse and DirecTV. The early adoption of AT&T's DirecTV Now doesn't seem to have had a major impact on its traditional TV subscribers; it lost 27,000 subs last quarter versus 26,000 a year ago. Time will tell if AT&T sees more cannibalization over time. Meanwhile, Verizon's video customer base is relatively small and geographically limited. A nationwide streaming service could help it cut into competitors' markets more than its own FiOS TV service. While the margins on these streaming linear TV packages are much smaller than traditional TV, the opportunity to bundle nationwide makes them much more valuable for AT&T and Verizon. For Dish, it leads to a deterioration of subscriber value over time, and the cost savings don't even come close to making up for it. ","

Main Street investors probably aren't familiar with Orange SA (NYSE:ORAN), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and Vestas Wind Systems (NASDAQOTH:VWDRY), but our Motley Fool contributors think that's a good thing. Since these companies aren't making front-page news (yet), they could be bargains worth adding to your portfolio. Anders Bylund (Orange): France-based telecom giant Orange SA runs a multinational network of wired and wireless telecommunications services. The company serves 263 million subscribers across 29 countries, including high-growth developing markets such as Egypt and the Middle East. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. By comparison, American peer Verizon serves just 142 million subscribers altogether. AT&T gets closer with a grand total of 210 million connections, but the count drops to 176 million if you back out Ma Bell's DirecTV satellite TV customers. Either way, Orange stands head and shoulders above its American counterparts in terms of business scale and customer reach. But how often do you think about this global telecom giant? Popular financial sites show a mere trickle of news about Orange, often nothing more than the company's own press releases for monthlong periods. The same sites show a mere handful of Wall Street analysts covering the stock -- or none at all. American investors simply don't see this company and stock very often, even though it trades directly on the Big Board. For those willing to dive a bit deeper, Orange would be well worth a second look. Analyst-tracking services that include European analyst firms in their ratings polls show 23 buy ratings and seven holds these days, versus no sell recommendations. In our Motley Fool CAPS system, 709 investors like you and me have rated Orange, with 96% of them giving the stock a thumbs-up rating. Orange offers a generous dividend policy, ambitious international growth plans, and deep-discount valuation ratios. I can't say for sure that Wall Street is actively trying to hide Orange from American investors, but it's the closest thing to a secret weapon you'll find in my own real-world investment portfolio. Todd Campbell (Shopify): As Anders points out, stocks with headquarters outside the U.S. often fly under the radar, and that can present a great opportunity for investors savvy enough to find them. One company that I think more investors should be aware of is Shopify, a Canadian provider of software solutions to small and midsize retailers. It seamlessly services brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers with a suite of solutions that help them win customers, manage inventory, and process payments, and its sales growth is downright inspiring. The number of merchants relying on its system jumped to over 375,000 in the fourth quarter from 243,000 a year ago, and as a result, sales grew 86% year over year to $130 million in the quarter. What I really like about this company is that its platform is highly scalable, and its business model has the potential to be very shareholder-friendly. Merchants pay a monthly subscription fee that ranges from $29 to $299, and those subscriptions provide a nice, steady source of recurring revenue, but processing merchant orders could be the big gravy train. Thanks to more merchants using its solutions -- and a healthy economy --  the dollar value of orders it processes grew 94% year over year to $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, and $2.2 billion of that volume was processed on its Shopify Payments service, up 120% from Q4 2015. As merchandise volume on its platform expands, so too will revenue, and right now, there's no evidence of momentum slowing. In fact, management thinks it can deliver sales of at least $580 million this year, and if it can deliver, it will represent yet another big year of growth for the company. SHOP Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Admittedly, the big black mark on this stock is that the company is still losing money. However, online retail sales still make up only a small percentage of total retail volume, and rapid growth could get this company into the black as soon as next year. Jason Hall (Vestas Wind Systems): With a market capitalization of more than $17 billion, wind turbine manufacturer, installer, and servicer Vestas Wind Systems isn't small at all, and it's one of the biggest renewable-energy companies in the world. But there's a good chance a lot of people reading this either haven't heard of it or don't know very much about it at all. And it may not be fair to say that Wall Street wants to keep it a secret, since it's based in Sweden, but there aren't any major U.S.-based analysts providing coverage of the company, despite the fact that it does hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. sales every year. But investors would do well to pay close attention. In coming decades, a growing global middle class is going to require a lot more electricity generation, and renewables such as wind are expected to produce a large amount of new electricity. Vestas, already a global leader in the industry, is positioned to profit from this trend. Vestas is pretty cheap right now, too, trading at less than 17 times last year's earnings. That's significantly below the nearly 27 times earnings you'd pay for the S&P 500. If you're looking to buy an under-the-radar leader in a wonderful growth industry, Vestas is worth a close look.

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) was the longest holdout of the four major U.S. wireless carriers when it came to unlimited data plans. While T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) released their unlimited plans with aggressive pricing, Verizon fought back by offering free iPhones and other device promotions. However, after disappointing fourth-quarter results, Verizon finally made the decision to go unlimited. What investors didn't know at the time was how bad Verizon's first quarter was going before it unveiled its new data plan. ""Prior to the unlimited launch, we had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers,"" CFO Matt Ellis told analysts on the first-quarter earnings call. That was just halfway through the quarter. Verizon ended the quarter with 289,000 net postpaid phone losses, so the unlimited plan worked to attract new subscribers and retain old ones, but the trajectory was clearly the impetus for unlimited. The questions for Verizon are: Can it continue its postpaid phone subscriber momentum throughout the rest of 2017, and how will unlimited data plans affect its revenue? Image source: Verizon. Ellis was keen to note that Verizon added 109,000 net postpaid phone subscribers since mid-February, when it introduced the unlimited plan. That ""gives us momentum entering the second quarter,"" he said. However, when asked specifically about whether market dynamics have gotten better in the second quarter and if Verizon could see an improvement in its net adds, Ellis dodged the question: ""We'll have to wait and see,"" he responded, continuing: Right now, we're very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. ... We will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion and we'll see how the quarter plays out. That said, Sprint ended its ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion. T-Mobile was particularly aggressive last quarter, running a friends and family discount and offering a free line to customers in early March. While there's no telling what the competition will do this quarter, things are starting to cool down. Verizon's second quarter is historically stronger than its first quarter. In 2015, it added 321,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the second quarter. Last year, that fell to 86,000 net adds. But as Ellis said, we'll have to wait and see what kind of affect the unlimited plan will have on net adds. The first set of subscribers to switch to Verizon's unlimited plan are those who stand to save some money -- that is, customers who were previously on Verizon's highest data plan. Additionally, unlimited data plans ensure Verizon won't be able to capitalize on data overage fees, which contribute meaningfully to its revenue. Verizon's wireless operating revenue declined 6.1% year over year last quarter. Verizon uses a metric that masks the affects of these changes -- average revenue per account. ARPA increased to $166.01 in the first quarter compared to $165.03 last year. But connections per account also increased, from 3.0 to 3.08. As such, average revenue per connection actually declined from $55.01 to $53.90. Ellis elaborated on the earnings call: We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be ARPA neutral over time, as more users step up in price, which is already taking place. New customer accounts added after the unlimited launch on average had higher account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near term, we expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages over time. It could get worse before it gets better for Verizon investors. The competition remains fierce, but the strength of Verizon's network and brand will help it keep its churn rate low, and the relatively competitive pricing of its unlimited plan could attract new subscribers. The first full quarter of its unlimited plan will be a major test, and we'll see if Verizon can turn things around. Watch for continued declines in revenue and improvements in net postpaid phone additions. ","

T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) aggressive pursuit of growth over the past few years has already been paying off, but Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) earnings report this morning showing that it lost retail customers for the first time represents an important inflection point in the U.S. wireless industry. While T-Mobile has been poaching customers from all other carriers for years, the dominant domestic wireless carrier has held up relatively well despite intensifying competition -- until now. Big Red has relied on its brand strength and strong retention of valuable postpaid subscribers to defend itself, and has only made modest concessions in response to T-Mobile's various Un-carrier initiatives, which now number over a dozen different moves to upend the industry. Verizon's latest reactive effort was relaunching unlimited data plans in February, which were still priced at a premium relative to T-Mobile One. T-Mobile management on an earnings call. Image source: T-Mobile. For what it's worth, Verizon says that Verizon Unlimited helped mitigate some of the customer losses in the first quarter; it ended up losing 307,000 net postpaid customers, but would have lost 398,000 if it weren't for Verizon Unlimited. Never one to let up, T-Mobile poked fun at the date of Verizon's earnings release, insinuating that Verizon may have been celebrating the ""holiest of high days"" (bonus points for puppy memes). In an emailed statement to CNBC, Verizon responded: We like puppy memes too. But today, like every day, we're focused on improving America's most reliable network. We're also busy enhancing our network to handle 3D, virtual reality and holographic puppy memes. Verizon is still the market leader by far, but T-Mobile has been making incredible progress growing its customer base. Verizon closed out the first quarter with 113.9 million total retail connections. T-Mobile hasn't reported first-quarter results yet, but finished 2016 with 71.5 million total customers (including wholesale) after adding 6.6 million throughout the year. Verizon does not report wholesale connections, and for reporting purposes Verizon's ""retail"" connections are synonymous with T-Mobile's ""branded"" customers. For comparability purposes, if we stack up T-Mobile's branded net additions next to Verizon's retail net additions (excluding wholesale for both carriers), the aforementioned inflection point becomes clear: Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. The U.S. wireless market is quite mature at this point, and overall isn't really growing all that much any more in terms of connections and customers. As the market leader, it makes sense that Verizon has struggled to find growth, while T-Mobile has been growing by gaining share and stealing customers. There are still revenue growth opportunities as data consumption continues to rise, driven in large part by mobile video, and carriers attempt to monetize that increased usage. The tough part is that aggressive pricing is the key to T-Mobile's success (in addition to savvy marketing campaigns that appeal to younger demographics), which undermines efforts to increase average revenue per user (ARPU); T-Mobile's branded postpaid phone ARPU was effectively flat in the fourth quarter ($48.37). Verizon reports average revenue per account (ARPA), which includes all lines in an account, and as such isn't directly comparable with T-Mobile's ARPU metrics; Verizon ARPA was $136.98 last quarter (down 6%). Overall, the Un-carrier continues to crush it, while Big Red searches for growth elsewhere. ","

Dividends aren't sexy but they are effective. While companies that offer regular payouts aren't likely to triple in value in any given year, dividends are the strong and steady force behind many retirement portfolios. Over time, such payments create dynamic wealth. Consider the two companies we are investigating today: telecom giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Over the last 25 years, their stocks have gone up 130% and 940%, respectively. But when we take dividends into account, this is what happens. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts. If I had my way, I'd jump into a time machine, grab my beginner investor self, and tell him, ""Brian, there's nothing more important to your success than picking companies with the strongest sustainable competitive advantages."" That's because these advantages, often referred to as ""moats,"" are what separate a companies from the rest of the field. They provide that special something that keeps customers coming back for more and the competition at bay for ages. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson has three different divisions, each with its own moat. The consumer division, which accounts for 18% of sales, is buoyed by the strength of the company's brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol. The medical device division -- which comprises 35% of all sales -- benefits from large installed bases and moderately high switching costs for hospitals. And biggest of all, pharmaceuticals -- pulling in 47% of all sales -- is protected by patents. It's somewhat concerning that patents only last a specific amount of time, and yet they protect almost half of the company's revenue. At the same time, the reliability of the other two divisions allows Johnson & Johnson some leeway that other pharmaceutical companies don't have. Verizon is also making inroads into becoming a content company. The acquisitions of AOL and part of Yahoo! are evidence of this. If this seems like a lot of ink spilled over the moats for these two, that's because it is. It's impossible for me to solidly declare a winner here, as both are very strong. Investors love seeing cash returned to them. But it's important to keep cash sitting in the bank, too. That's because every company will deal with tough economic times. When those times hit, companies with cash have options: buy back shares on the cheap, acquire competitors, or outspend them in an attempt to gain market share. Those with a lot of debt are in the opposite boat, fragilized by their tenuous obligations. In the chart below, I've adjusted Verizon's free cash flow numbers to normalize them. They were artificially lower due to the fact that the company paid a large one-time tax bill for divesting some of its business, and it changed its business model to do far less subsidizing of phone plans. Remember that Johnson & Johnson is valued 70% higher than Verizon. Here's how the two stack up: Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $4 billion $105 billion $13.1 billion $13.8 billion Johnson & Johnson $42 billion $22 billion $16.5 billion $15.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance, SEC filings. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend FCF Payout Verizon 13 14 3.0 4.8% 67%* Johnson & Johnson 19 22 2.7 2.6% 55% Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. *FCF for Verizon is adjusted for the factors mentioned above. On the face of it, Johnson & Johnson appears to be the more expensive stock, trading at a significant premium on an earnings and free cash flow basis. But the company is growing faster than Verizon as well, and trades at a 10% discount to Verizon on the PEG ratio. In the end, the differentiator is the dividend. Verizon's payout is safe and much larger than Johnson & Johnson's. So there you have it: We have a draw. Both companies have solid moats, Johnson & Johnson has the stronger balance sheet, and Verizon is more attractively valued. If I were forced to choose, I would side with Johnson & Johnson, as I like the company's opportunities to grow in the future, while I think Verizon's foray into content is a bit riskier. Either way, both of these companies are solid dividend payers worthy of your careful consideration. ","

Verizon (NYSE:VZ) wants to find a merger partner, and it's not being shy about making it known to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Disney, or any other big player that might be willing to entertain the idea. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam specifically mentioned he'd be open to talking with Comcast's CEO Brian Roberts, telling Bloomberg last week: If Brian came knocking on the door, I'd have a discussion with him about it. But I'd also tell you there isn't much that I wouldn't have a discussion around if somebody came and said ""here's a compelling reason why we ought to put the businesses together."" Image source: Getty Images. Why is the nation's largest wireless telecom company dropping not-so-subtle hints that it's interested in a merger? The answer came, at least in part, when Verizon reported its first-quarter 2017 earnings later in the week. Verizon lost 307,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year, down from a net gain of 640,000 this time last year. Those losses in net subscribers are a symptom of a larger problem within Verizon: The company needs much more than its wireless services to survive. The company earns 75% of its top line from its wireless business, which is taking a beating from the self-proclaimed un-carrier, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). Verizon's been losing this battle as T-Mobile has released a torrent of deals over the past few years, along with boosting its LTE coverage, speed, and dependability. All of this is starting to take its toll on Verizon. The carrier's chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, responded to all the news reports of McAdam's comments by saying on the earnings call that: We're confident in executing our strategy organically. If there's the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities. Basically, Ellis is saying that Verizon doesn't need a merger to succeed, but if someone's offering, then it's certainly open to talks. One could argue that it wouldn't be wise for a CFO to say anything less than ""we got this"" on an earnings call. The fact is that wireless networks in the U.S. have quickly become the boring roads that lead their subscribers to more interesting destinations on the internet. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T (NYSE:T) all get you to the same place, with a relatively smooth ride, and it's getting harder and harder to stand apart from the crowd. To get there, Verizon has stepped further into the content space, which is why the company purchased AOL and is buying Yahoo!, and why it invested in its go90 video platform. But those moves pale in comparison to rival AT&T's $85 billion deal to merge with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL). The deal is still pending approval, but once it closes it will give AT&T access to Time Warner's treasure trove of content, including HBO, TNT, CNN, and Warner Bros. Verizon could soon be left on the content sidelines, with its stalling wireless business, and no major long-term growth prospects in sight. McAdam admitted to Bloomberg that he knows there's ""never a dream deal"" that will bring the company everything it wants. But a major merger could bring his company something that it desperately needs: a big step toward content. Verizon spent years building out an extensive wireless network so its subscribers could access anything they wanted online. And it achieved that goal arguably better and faster than any of its wireless competitors. But now it's time for the company to transition away from building roads for the internet, and start creating destinations of its own. If it can't do that alone, then a merger is the most logical choice. ","

High dividend yields can be tantalizing, especially with interest rates so low. But a high yield sometimes comes with the risk that the dividend could be slashed. Not only will that cut into your income, but the stock price will likely fall as well, a double whammy for dividend investors. Avoiding high-yield stocks that have an elevated risk of dividend cuts is a good idea, even if it means missing out on some dividend income today. Here's why Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), GameStop (NYSE:GME), and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) should be avoided. Image source: Getty Images. Embattled toy maker Mattel has so far maintained its generous dividend, even as sales and profits continue to sink. Total revenue dropped 8% year over year during the critical holiday quarter, driving a 19% plunge in net income. This weak performance left retailers with elevated levels of inventory, reducing new orders during the first quarter and leading Mattel to report a 15% decline in sales. The company posted a net loss of $113 million during the seasonally weak quarter, more than 50% bigger than the loss during the prior-year period. Mattel stock has tumbled since peaking in early 2014, driving the dividend yield up over the 6% mark. That certainly looks tempting, but earnings haven't been sufficient to cover that dividend since 2013. This is a situation that can go on for a while, but not forever. If Mattel can't improve its bottom line substantially in the near future, a dividend cut will become necessary. Mattel has some things going for it. The company owns popular brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher Price, and its recent revenue shortfalls are partly due to the one-off loss of the Disney Princess license. In the long run, Mattel has a good shot at eventually turning things around. If you're a dividend investor, though, best to stay away. That juicy dividend may not be long for this world. Video game retailer GameStop is already preparing for the possibility that video games one day go completely digital. The company is expanding its fleet of stores that sell consumer electronics and collectibles while reducing its massive footprint of video game stores. But GameStop remains heavily dependent on selling physical games, particularly used games. During 2016, used and value games accounted for more than one-third of the company's gross profit. GameStop may well survive past the point when console games go fully digital, but it will be a completely different company. GameStop stock looks like a bargain, trading for less than seven times earnings, but those earnings are generated by a line of business that may not exist five or 10 years from now. The dividend also looks enticing, yielding about 6.5%, but it won't survive if GameStop's core business falls apart. Buying GameStop stock is a bet that a retailer with more than 7,600 stores, the vast majority of which sell physical games, will be able to adapt to a world where games are going digital and where retail in general is in upheaval. That's not a bet I'm willing to make, and investors shouldn't be tempted by a dividend that will look perfectly sustainable right until the rug is pulled out from under them. Verizon's dividend may seem safe, given its long-held status as the leading provider of wireless service in the U.S. But competition is catching up. Verizon reported its first net decline in wireless customers ever during the first quarter, losing over 300,000 to scrappy rivals like T-Mobile. The company was forced to reintroduce unlimited plans to keep up with the competition, a move that prevented an even bigger decline in subscribers. But revenue fell by 7.3% year over year, and net profit plunged 20%. Verizon stock sports a dividend yield of 4.75%, and until recently there wasn't much concern that the dividend could be at risk. But Verizon paid out $9.3 billion in dividends last year compared to just $5.1 billion in free cash flow and $13.6 billion in net income. The era when Verizon could charge premium prices and still post healthy subscriber gains appears to be over. If subscribers keep fleeing, Verizon will be forced to slash prices, and that will hit the bottom line. A big acquisition could be in the cards, which would likely saddle the company with even more debt. Verizon may look to diversify away from wireless, but the balance sheet already has $105 billion of long-term debt, more than double compared to 2012. The dividend may be harder to maintain if even more cash must go toward interest payments. There's a lot to dislike about Verizon at this point, and dividend investors shouldn't assume that the dividend is safe. A dividend cut is far less likely with Verizon compared to the other two companies above, but it's still a risk. ","

With a market cap around $600 million, Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) doesn't generate a lot of headlines. (In fact, just three analysts joined the company's most recent conference call.) But with its shares rising 140% over the last 12 months, you can bet more and more people are beginning to notice this Canadian company with a peculiar name. TCX data by YCharts Tucows -- yes, its logo includes two cows -- says its mission is to ""provide simple, useful services that help people unlock the power of the Internet."" In a nutshell, the company operates a large Internet domain registration business, as well as smaller mobile and fiber internet businesses. Image source: Tucows. From 2012 to 2016, Tucows' revenue increased from $114.7 million to $189.8 million -- a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 13.4%. As a result of the significant operating leverage in its lean business structure, its bottom line grew nearly three times as fast over the same period, from $4.5 million to $16.1 million -- a 37.3% CAGR. A couple other highlights from 2016 show more strong performance. Owing to rapid expansion of the company's mobile business, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 43% last year to $30.1 million. And perhaps most importantly to the company's long-term strategy, the company produced substantial cash flow from operations of $21.6 million in 2016, a 62% increase from the prior year. Image source: Tucows Feb. 2017 investor presentation Tucows says it is the second-largest domain registry in the world, behind only GoDaddy. While the company does sell domain names directly to consumers and businesses, the lion's share of revenue in this segment comes from registration fees charged to resellers. Tucows has grown its domain businesses substantially over the years through a series of acquisitions. The latest was announced in January, when TuCows agreed to purchase eNom for $83.5 million. As an example of how Tucows wrings efficiencies out of these acquisitions, eNom was generating around $15 in annual EBITDA at the time of sale, but Tucows believes it will be able to grow this to roughly $20 million within two years. Domain services is Tucows largest segment, comprising 61% of the company's total revenues. While organic growth is not expected to be robust, the domain business throws off large, reliable amounts of cash, (the company has had 14 consecutive years of positive cash flow from operations ) which Tucows then uses to invest in its other, faster-growing segment. Tucows' other segment includes a fast-growing mobile business, as well as its nascent high-speed internet division. Ting Mobile launched nationally in 2012 and offers phone service at deep discounts, with the company saying an average monthly bill is about $23 per device. All of Ting's services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis with no fixed contracts. The company also boasts top-notch customer service, reporting a ""net promoter score"" -- which measures customers' enthusiasm for a business -- of 73, which it says is on par with beloved tech companies Amazon (69) and Apple (76) and far above the 16 of the broad category of mobile phone providers.. At the end of 2014, the company had 94,000 Ting Mobile subscribers. By the end of 2016, that number had risen more than 60% to 151,000. With that kind of meteoric growth, and with Ting Mobile's gross margins of around 50%, it's easy to get excited about the company's efforts to scale this business up. Mobile services revenue for 2016 grew 22% to $70 million, which was 37% of the company's total revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Then there's Ting Internet, launched in 2015, which provides high-speed fiber internet access to a few small towns -- Holly Springs, North Carolina; Westminster, Maryland; and Charlottesville, Virginia. While deep-pocketed broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon are competition, Ting believes it offers much better value, and like its mobile sibling, offers services on a monthly basis with no fixed contracts. Ting Internet is tiny at only 2% of revenue, but it's also just getting started. Ting plans to add service to Centennial, Colorado, and Sandpoint, Idaho, in 2017, and it expects to announce plans for additional towns later this year. In its first year of launching Ting Internet in a community, the company expects 20% uptake, growing to 50% uptake within five years. And while Ting Internet is not yet profitable, the company is targeting late 2018 or early 2019 as its breakeven point. Tucows has been rewarding shareholders by buying back massive amounts of its own stock -- around 50% of total shares since 2007. In addition, in February the company announced its latest buyback program, planning to repurchase up to $40 million worth of shares over the next 12 months. This represents 7% of Tucows' market cap at current prices. Tucows strategy of milking its core domain business to fund its higher-growth mobile and internet ventures has provided some incredible returns for shareholders. But keep in mind this is a pricey small cap with lumpy earnings, and has been growing heavily through acquisitions. In other words, expect plenty of volatility. While it may be a bumpy ride, so long as the company continues to execute, Tucows growth prospects continue to look mighty appetizing. ","

Dividend-paying stocks tend to perform better, as a group, than their non-dividend counterparts, and also generally do better during tough economic times. For investors who want exposure to rock-solid dividend stocks, but don't want the guesswork and risk involved with choosing individual stocks, there are some excellent ETFs available that could work well in your portfolio. Two of the biggest dividend stock ETFs are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT:SCHD). Here's some information about each, and the key differences between them. Image source: Getty Images. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, and invests in 428 stocks that pay higher-than-average dividend yields, and specifically excludes REITs (I'll discuss more details of the portfolio shortly). Based on the past 12 months of distributions, the fund yields 2.95%, and over the past 10 years, the fund has averaged a total return of 7.58%. The ETF has $24.7 billion in assets, and charges a rather low expense ratio of 0.08%. In other words, this means that for every $10,000 you have invested in the fund, you'll pay $8 in fees annually. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks a different index, the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Like the FTSE index tracked by the Vanguard fund, this consists of high-yield dividend stocks and specifically excludes REITs, but contains far fewer stocks (roughly one-fourth). Over the past 12 months, the Schwab ETF has generated a distribution yield of 2.89%. A 10-year performance record isn't available, as the fund's inception took place in 2011, but the performance is on par with its index so far. The fund has about $5.3 billion in assets, and charges an even lower expense ratio than the Vanguard product at just 0.07%. The 0.01% difference won't have too much of an impact on investment performance, even over the long run, but still -- cheaper is cheaper. Both funds are weighted, which means that certain stocks make up a greater portion of the respective portfolios than others. For this reason, it's a good idea to take a look at the top holdings of each fund.

As you can see, both portfolios have significant overlap. Not only are the two largest holdings exactly the same, but there are a total of five common stocks among these top 10 lists. However, an important distinction is that because the index on which it's based is much smaller, the Schwab fund is much more ""top-heavy."" Specifically, the top 10 holdings of the Vanguard ETF account for 31.2% of that fund's portfolio. With the Schwab ETF, the top 10 make up 45% of the total. In other words, the performance of the Schwab ETF is more dependent on a smaller group of stocks.

637,Ryan Knutson,4272017,MarketWatch,4202017,"Published: Apr 20, 2017 11:16 a.m. ET By Verizon Communications Inc., once the untouchable leader of the U.S. wireless industry, is struggling to hold onto customers and getting them to pay a premium for its service. The carrier posted its first ever quarterly net loss of wireless subscribers during the first three months of 2017, showing the extent of the damage resurgent rivals T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. have inflicted on the nation's largest carrier by subscribers. Verizon unexpectedly brought back unlimited data plans in February, which it had stopped selling in 2011, seeking to blunt the appeal of similar offers from T-Mobile and Sprint. That offer hit financials: Verizon had a 5.1% decline in revenue in its wireless business, to $20.9 billion. The results will put pressure on Verizon's management to either find a way to turn things around or make moves that will diversify the company away from the wireless business, where most Americans already have a smartphone and price wars have pinched profits. Verizon stock is trading more than 1.5% lower Thursday. The industry's bruising price war has been a boon to consumers. Wireless bills are a major household expense, and their continued decline had a big impact on March's surprising 0.3% drop in the consumer price index. Prices for wireless telephone services fell 11.4% in March from a year earlier, after a 7% decline in February. Rival AT&T Inc. has diversified with its acquisition of DirecTV and proposed purchase of media giant Time Warner Inc. But Verizon doubled down in 2014 with its $130 billion purchase of Vodafone Group PLC's 45% stake in their Verizon Wireless joint venture. Since then, Verizon has spent more than $10 billion on smaller deals such as AOL and Yahoo Inc., but neither deal is enough to move the needle. The company has also explored bigger transactions, including with Charter Communications Inc., The Wall Streeet Journal has reported, though executives have recently signaled the two sides are far apart. ""We're confident in executing our strategy organically, but if there's the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we're always looking at those opportunities,"" said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis on a call with analysts. More Verizon customers used the unlimited plan to reduce their bills -- moving from expensive data plans to the cheaper unlimited one -- than customers chose to pay up. Average revenue per account, including device payments, increased by only $1, to $166 from $165 in the year-ago period. The introduction of unlimited plans, along with a ""safety mode"" feature launched last year, also chipped away at lucrative ""overage"" revenue, which comes from the fees Verizon charges when customers exceed their monthly data limits. Much of the pain Verizon is going through began as a result of moves T-Mobile began making in 2013, such as ending two-year contracts and canceling overage fees. John Legere, T-Mobile's brash chief executive, mocked Verizon's results on Twitter. T-Mobile and AT&T are slated to report their latest quarterly results in the coming weeks. The company's revenue and profit came in less than Wall Street was expecting. The stock, already down 8.3% so far this year, fell another 2% to $48.03 in early Thursday trading. Verizon said Thursday the unlimited data plan ""positively changed the trajectory of customer additions"" in the quarter, but it still reported a net decline of 307,000 retail postpaid connections during the first three months of the year, including 289,000 phone losses. That compares with 640,000 retail postpaid net additions in the year-ago period, including 8,000 phone losses. Before the launch of its ""Verizon Unlimited"" plans in mid-February, Verizon had a retail postpaid phone net loss of 398,000; after the launch, Verizon said it added 109,000 retail postpaid phone connections. Much of the pain Verizon is going through began as a result of moves T-Mobile began making in 2013, such as ending two year contracts and cancelling overage fees. John Legere, T-Mobile's brash CEO, mocked Verizon's results on Twitter. Verizon's rivals are slated to report their latest results in coming weeks. Verizon's decision in recent years to give away free tablets as a way to juice subscriber numbers is also coming back to haunt it, as many of the customers who signed up for two-year data plans in exchange for a free tablet aren't renewing their subscriptions. Verizon expects improvement in wireless service revenue this year, with total revenue ""fairly consistent"" with 2016. But that stands to leave Verizon in a familiar position: slowing growth on the top and bottom lines, and a sliding stock price. Overall, for the March quarter, Verizon reported net income of $3.45 billion, or 84 cents a share, compared with $4.31 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, Verizon earned 95 cents a share. Total revenue, which includes the wireline segment and FiOS service, fell 7.3% to $29.8 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of 96 cents on $30.5 billion in revenue.

lost more customers than it gained for the first time, but the telecommunications giant's revenues missed expectations in a Tuesday report as sales of wireless equipment hit an all-time low. AT&T reported net income of $3.5 billion, or 56 cents a share, on revenue of $39.4 billion. After adjusting for amortization and other factors, the company claimed adjusted earnings of 74 cents a share. Analysts expected on average for AT&T to report adjusted earnings of 74 cents a share on revenue of $40.5 billion, according to FactSet. AT&T said it added 2.7 million wireless customers in the quarter, well above analysts' average estimate of 1.3 million wireless net adds, with AT&T crediting the performance largely to prepaid phone plans and connected devices. However, the company's sales total dropped from $40.5 billion in the year-ago quarter because of its lowest wireless equipment sales on record, suggesting new customers were bringing their own phones or buying cheaper models. AT&T also updated its full-year guidance to remove its revenue forecast, explaining that it ""is no longer providing consolidated revenue guidance primarily due to the unpredictability of wireless handset sales.""

Ziedins also cheerily notes that this “half-full” market remains robustly optimistic and is ignoring every reason it should sell off, even as Congress, Trump, the Fed, Britain, France, Syria, Russia and North Korea “have all given us reasons to be cautious.” Here’s something that really has been moving: Amazon.com’s stock

641,,5042017,Reuters,4272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday declined to rehear a challenge to the Obama administration’s landmark “net neutrality” rules requiring internet providers to guarantee equal access to all websites. The decision by the full appeals court in Washington not to reconsider a three-judge panel’s decision that upheld the ruling comes days after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed to undo the 2015 net neutrality that reclassified internet providers like public utilities. The 2015 order bars internet providers from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai has proposed reversing the reclassification and scrapping internet conduct standards, and has asked for comment on whether the FCC can or should retain any of the rules barring blocking, throttling or “fast lanes.” Judge Sri Srinivasan said in a written opinion reviewing the decision “would be particularly unwarranted at this point in light of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the FCC’s order.” The FCC is set to hold an initial vote on May 18 on Pai’s proposal but Srinivasan questioned why the full court should review “the validity of a rule that the agency had already slated for replacement.” US Telecom, the trade group representing major telephone companies that sued the FCC in 2015 over the rules, said Monday it will “review our legal options going forward to fully protect our open internet.” Two dissenting opinions said the 2015 order was unlawful because Congress did not grant the FCC authority to reclassify internet providers. Judge Janice Rogers Brown said the order “shows signs of a government having grown beyond the consent of the governed.” Judge Brett Kavanagh wrote that the order violates the First Amendment rights of internet providers. “The government must keep its hands off the editorial decisions of Internet service providers,” he wrote, suggesting the government cannot force a bookstore or Amazon.com Inc “to feature and promote all books in the same manner.” In a statement Monday, Pai said the decision not to rehear the decision was expected and he praised points raised in the dissents. Websites like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet providers such as AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp opposed the Obama order, saying it made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment. Chip Pickering, head of the trade group INCOMPAS that includes Amazon, Facebook and Netflix Inc, said the decision was a “blow to those who want to take away open internet protections, raise prices and cut off the streaming revolution.” ","

642,,5042017,Reuters,4272017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released a 58-page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 “net neutrality” order and disclosed the agency may withdraw “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Pai’s plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its “bright line” rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Pai’s plan, saying it “would allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providers’ customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.” Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. “We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,” Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment “on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.” The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling “is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.” The proposal also questions the ban on “paid prioritization” that the proposal argues was adopted to “address an apparently nonexistent problem.” AT&T said the question “is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.” ","

Revenue in Comcast’s cable business rose 5.8 percent as the company added 42,000 video subscribers and 429,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, which industry analysts considered to be strong growth. “We believe wireless represents the next massive opportunity for cable and this has yet to be embraced by investors,” wrote Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research. “We are very content with the company we’ve got,” Comcast CEO Brian Roberts told CNBC on Thursday when asked about McAdam’s comments. Sales in its NBCUniversal unit were up 14.7 percent, helped by a 43.2 percent increase in filmed entertainment revenue. Net income attributable to the company rose 20.2 percent to $2.57 billion, or 53 cents a share, in the first quarter. Revenue jumped 8.9 percent to $20.46 billion.

644,,5042017,Reuters,4272017,"Cyxtera will be the latest private equity-backed company  looking to take advantage of U.S. businesses’ burgeoning demand to have their data hosted and connected to the Internet, which has raised valuations in the data center space. Earlier this year, Digital Bridge Holdings LLC, a private firm that invests in data centers, agreed to acquire Vantage Data Centers Management Co LLC from buyout firm Silver Lake Partners for more than $1 billion. Private equity firms BC Partners and Medina Capital will co-own Cyxtera, and said they would try to make the new company stand out by mixing data centers with cyber security assets. While CenturyLink’s 57 data centers make up the majority of the company, the cyber security firms that were rolled into it by Medina Capital, called Cryptzone, Catbird, Easy Solutions, and Brainspace, will be key to helping the Miami-based company grow revenues, said Cyxtera CEO Manny Medina. “Like we did at Terremark, we have a game plan to acquire products that work well together and integrate them into solutions that will become market leaders,” Medina said. Cyxtera will be able to cross-sell cyber products to its 3,500 existing data centers. The company will also be able to develop new cyber products to help protect data centers specifically, which is an emerging area with revenue potential, said BC Partners managing director Justin Bateman. CenturyLink will retain a minority stake in the company worth $150 million, while Longview Asset Management is also an investor. ","

645,,5042017,Reuters,4272017,"Dish was the second-largest winner in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission auction of broadcaster airwaves this year, bidding $6.2 billion to increase its spectrum holdings. Companies taking part in the auction were restrained from holding merger talks for over a year until the ban ended last week. On the company’s post-earnings conference call, Dish Chief Executive Charlie Ergen declined to comment on whether it had been approached by other companies. But when asked whether Dish would prefer to sell or leasing its spectrum as opposed to keeping it, he said that the company was open to options that would ultimately increase shareholder value. “At least today, we think that means someone looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner,” Ergen said. The company said it lost about 143,000 net pay-TV subscribers in its first quarter through March 31, after losing 23,000 a year earlier. The number was roughly double analysts’ average estimate of a loss of 72,000 subscribers, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Churn, or the rate of customer defections among pay-TV subscribers, rose to 1.69 percent in the quarter, from 1.63 percent a year earlier. Net income attributable to Dish fell to $376 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, from $400 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.9 pct to $3.68 billion from $3.83 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 69 cents per share on revenue of $3.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Dish shares fell 2.3 percent to close at $62.93. The stock has surged more than 26 percent in the past 12 months. ","

646,,5042017,Reuters,4272017,"For the first quarter ended March 31, the New York-based media company, which is home to the popular series “The Big Bang Theory” and “Homeland,” reported a 16 percent jump in revenue from content licensing and distribution. Affiliate and subscription revenue - which include revenue from cable TV operators and from its own streaming content - was up 16.6 percent. But advertising sales, which account for half of the company’s total revenue, dropped 23 percent to $1.6 billion from a year earlier, when the broadcaster’s results included popular events such as the 50th anniversary of the National Football League’s Super Bowl championship and an extra NFL playoff game. CBS anticipates its retransmission consent and reverse compensation - which is the revenue from distributors and broadcast affiliates - to increase about 25 percent this year, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves told investors on an analyst call on Thursday. The company, which also owns cable television’s Showtime, is anticipating continued affiliate revenue growth at a time when the pay TV industry just reported its worst-ever subscriber loss for the first quarter. “We are not being affected in any way by any changes in subscription numbers throughout the industry,” Moonves said on the call. CBS shares were up 1.8 percent at $65 in extended trading on Thursday. Subscription and retransmission fees help the company offset fluctuations in advertising revenue, which can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on events. The company said it is also focused on owning more of its content to help control costs and monetize it more effectively. CBS owns 16 of the 19 shows it is renewing this season. Excluding one-time items, CBS reported quarterly profit from continuing operations of $1.04 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income from continuing operations rose to $454 million, or $1.09 per share, in the first quarter from $442 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue fell to $3.34 billion from $3.59 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.27 billion. ","

It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.” Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. “We were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,” Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment “on whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.” The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling “is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.” The proposal also questions the ban on “paid prioritization” that the proposal argues was adopted to “address an apparently nonexistent problem.” AT&T said the question “is not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.” ","

Companies taking part in the auction were restrained from holding merger talks for over a year until the ban ended last week. On the company’s post-earnings conference call, Dish Chief Executive Charlie Ergen declined to comment on whether it had been approached by other companies. But when asked whether Dish would prefer to sell or leasing its spectrum as opposed to keeping it, he said that the company was open to options that would ultimately increase shareholder value. “At least today, we think that means someone looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner,” Ergen said. The company said it lost about 143,000 net pay-TV subscribers in its first quarter through March 31, after losing 23,000 a year earlier. The number was roughly double analysts’ average estimate of a loss of 72,000 subscribers, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. Churn, or the rate of customer defections among pay-TV subscribers, rose to 1.69 percent in the quarter, from 1.63 percent a year earlier. Net income attributable to Dish fell to $376 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, from $400 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.

Affiliate and subscription revenue - which include revenue from cable TV operators and from its own streaming content - was up 16.6 percent. But advertising sales, which account for half of the company’s total revenue, dropped 23 percent to $1.6 billion from a year earlier, when the broadcaster’s results included popular events such as the 50th anniversary of the National Football League’s Super Bowl championship and an extra NFL playoff game. CBS anticipates its retransmission consent and reverse compensation - which is the revenue from distributors and broadcast affiliates - to increase about 25 percent this year, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves told investors on an analyst call on Thursday. The company, which also owns cable television’s Showtime, is anticipating continued affiliate revenue growth at a time when the pay TV industry just reported its worst-ever subscriber loss for the first quarter. “We are not being affected in any way by any changes in subscription numbers throughout the industry,” Moonves said on the call. CBS shares were up 1.8 percent at $65 in extended trading on Thursday. Subscription and retransmission fees help the company offset fluctuations in advertising revenue, which can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on events. The company said it is also focused on owning more of its content to help control costs and monetize it more effectively. CBS owns 16 of the 19 shows it is renewing this season. Excluding one-time items, CBS reported quarterly profit from continuing operations of $1.04 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The stock had surged nearly five-fold since April 7, a day before AT&T made the first move with a $95.63 per share offer. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of millimeter wave spectrum, which is expected to play a large role in 5G. In general, 5G is expected to boast higher speeds, shorter response times and more capacity. The spectrum is particularly important for 5G broadband services that AT&T and Verizon hope to launch to better compete with high-speed Internet offerings from cable companies. “Verizon now has all of the pieces in place to quickly accelerate the deployment of 5G,” Hans Vestberg, president of global network and technology at Verizon, said in a statement. AT&T did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April, AT&T said it would buy Straight Path for $1.25 billion in an all stock deal. Straight Path said later that it received a bid from an unnamed bidder that Reuters reported was Verizon, citing sources. The transaction “positions Verizon well ahead of peers in access to high frequency spectrum holdings suitable for 5G,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note. But shares of Straight Path slumped 20 percent in midday trading to $178 as news of the deal dashed investor hopes of a bidding war between the two largest U.S. wireless carriers. The frenzy around Straight Path started after an anonymous short-seller tipped off regulators in November 2015 that the company had not built communications systems as it had claimed, leading to an investigation by the U.S. Federal Communication Commission. The company settled with the FCC and put itself on the block in January. Verizon will pay, on behalf of Straight Path, a termination fee of $38 million to AT&T. The deal is expected to close within nine months, pending review by the FCC. As part of the earlier settlement with FCC, Straight Path will pay the U.S. government a 20 percent cut from the sale of its spectrum licenses. Evercore was financial adviser to Straight Path and Weil, and Gotshal & Manges served as company counsel on the deal. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as counsel to Verizon. ","

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wants the commission repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. “We propose to repeal utility-style regulation,” Pai said on  Thursday. “This is the right way to go.” Stocks of major internet providers rose on Thursday. The public will have until mid-August to offer comments before the FCC votes on a final plan. Pai wants public input on whether the FCC has the authority or should keep its “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai declined on Thursday to commit to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” He added he would make public a final proposal before a final vote. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who voted against the plan, said the end game appears to be an internet without FCC regulatory oversight. She said the proposal “jeopardizes the ability of the open internet to function tomorrow, as it does today.” Many companies and Republicans think Congress should pass legislation clarifying the FCC’s role to resolve a decade-long dispute over internet regulations. The FCC, which has already received more than 1 million comments, is also seeking comment on whether U.S. states should be able to set their own internet regulations governing broadband privacy and other issues. Providers insist they will not engage in blocking or throttling even in the absence of rules, but critics are skeptical. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, said “it will take millions of people standing up, just like they did before, to say that the internet needs to stay free and open.

Though they operate in the same industry, Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) are two telecom companies of a very different nature. In fact, the past decade has seen Frontier's business model come under siege, while Verizon has largely strengthened its hand, even if it has underperformed the market averages over the past five years (before the effect of dividends). VZ data by YCharts However, this kind of backward-looking analysis doesn't necessarily say much about which company represents the better investment today. After all, contrarian stock picks can yield the best returns under the right circumstances. To get a better sense of which stock looks like the better buy today, let's analyze Frontier and Verizon in three important areas. The telecom industry is well known for its heavy use of debt, and that trend holds true for both Verizon and Frontier. Here's a snapshot of four of the most important financial metrics to gauge a company's liquidity and solvency positions. Data sources: Frontier Communications and Verizon investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Click here to learn about the current ratio. Although they operate at different scales, Verizon and Frontier share plenty in common in their capital structure and cash flow composition. Each company keeps between 2% and 3% of its debt allocation in liquid assets and maintains a ratio of debt to cash from operations of about 10-to-1. In fact, it's difficult to ascertain an advantage for either company in this section, so let's call it a tie and move on. Image source: Getty Images. When we look at their moats, the material differences between Verizon and Frontier really start to show. Though Verizon provides Internet, cable, and landline phone services, the overwhelming majority of its subscribers and revenue come from its wireless telecom operations. As of its most recent earnings release, Verizon had 113 million pre-paid and post-paid wireless subscribers. Although the wireless market in the U.S. is reaching maturity, Verizon's shared place along with telecom giant AT&T at the top of the U.S. telecom market gives it a powerful position from which to grow its business empire. For example, Verizon has delved deeper into content and mobile advertising with its recent acquisitions of AOL and of Yahoo!'s core Internet business. Both moves should help increase the company's average revenue per user even as subscriber growth slows. On the other end of the spectrum, Frontier's business focuses on providing landline, TV, and internet packages to a small base of subscribers. As of its most recent earnings report, Frontier counted about 5.2 million consumer and business subscribers, down from about 5.4 million in the prior quarter. These are, in general, not growth businesses, but Frontier has done its best to position itself as one the strongest players in this space. Last year, for example, Frontier paid Verizon $8.6 billion to acquire customers in California, Texas, and Florida.  The company's CEO, however, blamed merger-related issues for its recent customer defections, and while that could indeed be the case, the big-picture comparison is a no-brainer: Verizon is in every sense the stronger to the two companies here. The differences in the quality of the two businesses shine through when considering their valuations. To that end, let's look at three of the most popular valuation metrics for Frontier and Verizon. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio. EV = enterprise value. EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Though Frontier generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations over the past 12 months, it lost $373 million last year, its second straight year of GAAP losses. Its cash-flow-generation capabilities have increased year over year in each of the past two years, so Frontier doesn't appear to be facing an imminent demise. However, the company's business model is flying in the face of many of the telecom industry's long-term trends, and that shows with its valuation. Verizon, on the other hand, is valued conservatively relative to the market, but that should come as no surprise, given the utility-like nature of the telecom business. For comparison, AT&T trades at 19 times past EPS and 13 times forward earnings, although its slightly higher valuation can also be attributed to its superior growth prospects versus Verizon. This contest was easy. Frontier has made some admirable moves to shore up its customer base in recent years, and these moves will benefit it in the years to come. But the long-term trends in the telecom industry could become too great for the company to overcome. Though Verizon could be more proactive in pursuing wireless video rights, the company's dominant position should allow it to remain one of the most powerful telecoms in the U.S., which makes Verizon the superior stock to buy today.

During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) bread-and-butter business got a little bit smaller. Retail subscribers to the nation's leading wireless network shrank for the first time in years, and profits decreased 21% from the same period in 2016. The mobile phone industry is a mature market with growth a thing of the past, leaving the few big competitors to fight over the same customers. For Verizon, the next big thing could be right around the corner. Verizon reported that net retail subscribers declined by 324,000 in the first three months of the year. Laying claim to ""the nation's best network,"" Verizon has managed to grow its customer base for years. As competitors' offerings have improved, though, the growth began to dry up, and last quarter's decline now looks all but inevitable in hindsight. Chart by author. Data source: Verizon quarterly earnings reports. As customers left for cheaper pastures, Verizon management wanted shareholders to know that things could have been worse. Before reluctantly rolling out an unlimited data plan similar to ones offered by smaller rivals, the exodus had reached 398,000. While the bad news has taken the spotlight, it isn't as if Verizon's strategy consists of just defending its turf. The company has been on the move in the last year gearing up for tomorrow. With the advent of 4G LTE technology, telecommunications began to look a lot like the internet. On a 4G network, calls and other information are all transmitted as data packets much like information sent across the worldwide web. Verizon is betting that, with that fundamental change in mobile networks, it can grow into more than just a phone company. It sees leveraging its leading mobile network to facilitate all sorts of communications of the future, chief among them the Internet of Things. The IoT, which is simply communication between devices, is fueling growing demand for an extensive, secure, and reliable medium to transmit information across. In response to that demand, which is arising from things like wearable devices, automobiles, and industrial equipment, Verizon has purchased a fair share of small companies and incorporated them into its IoT division. Purchases have included fleet and mobile workforce tracking and management systems and smart-city Wi-Fi hub developers. Image source: Verizon. Verizon's IoT business grew 17% year-over-year in the first quarter, with the telematics division (which includes connected auto and fleet management services) bringing in $214 million. That's a small amount compared to the $29.8 billion total revenue reported, but at least something is growing. Closely related to the IoT business is the company's continued work on its next-generation 5G mobile network, said to be a necessary development for the projected billions of devices expected to hit the streets each year that are transmitting and receiving communications. Verizon closed its acquisition of fiber optic telecom company XO Communications in the first quarter, which it plans to use for the faster and more reliable network of the future. The IoT division at Verizon barely even shows up on the quarterly radar, so it could take some time for shareholders to reap any rewards from it. In the meantime, we are left waiting with bated breath to see current wireless subscriber growth numbers each quarter. Perhaps the unleashing of the unlimited data plan was the silver bullet needed to keep things afloat in the short term, but patience should pay off as Verizon's IoT and 5G projects could eventually lead to exciting things down the road.

Shares of Straight Path Communications Inc. (NYSEMKT:STRP) were down 20.4% as of 1:00 p.m. EDT on Thursday as the one-sided bidding war for the wireless spectrum company finally came to an end. More specifically, today Straight Path announced it will sign a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) for $184 per share, representing an enterprise value of roughly $3.1 billion. For perspective, Straight Path stock closed yesterday at just under $224 per share. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. But this shouldn't be entirely surprising. Recall that Straight Path's meteoric rise began in January, when the company reached a favorable settlement with the Federal Communications Commission amid allegations that it obtained certain spectrum licenses from the FCC under fraudulent circumstances. In addition to paying a $15 million civil penalty to the FCC, Straight Path agreed to pursue strategic alternatives to sell its remaining licenses, or be forced to pay an additional penalty and surrender them to the FCC. Thankfully for Straight Path shareholders, the stock skyrocketed 150% in a single day last month after it agreed to be acquired by AT&T (NYSE:T) for $95.63 per share, or an enterprise value of $1.6 billion. Then shares continued to climb in the subsequent weeks after the company fielded successively higher offers from an unnamed ""multi-national telecommunications company"" -- widely presumed to be Verizon -- with Straight Path giving AT&T several days after each offer to respond with its own superior proposal. Most recently, Straight Path shares popped another 33% on Monday, to around $212 per share, as investors hoped the bidding would climb even higher than what turned out to be Verizon's winning $184-per-share bid. That's not to say AT&T came out empty-handed; Verizon has agreed to pay its largest competitor the required $38 million termination fee on behalf of Straight Path. But considering Straight Path's wireless spectrum assets are expected to play a key part in the impending rollouts of 5G networks, it seems safe to say that Verizon was more than happy to foot that bill. As it stands, the final deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both Verizon and Straight Path, is expected to close within nine months (subject to FCC review), and will be completed as an all-stock transaction intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization. So with Straight Path shares now trading within 3% of the agreed acquisition price, shareholders can either wait for the transaction to close and receive Verizon shares in return or -- keeping in mind any sales between now and then will be subject to capital gains (or loss) tax treatment -- take their money off the table and put it to work elsewhere.

New Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has quickly taken action to loosen regulation on internet service providers (ISPs). After exempting ISPs with fewer than 250,000 subscribers from disclosing network performance, fees, and data caps back in February, the next proposal takes aim at net neutrality rules that were put in place in 2015. The debate has been dredged back up, but it may not be the same this go-around. New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. Image source: FCC. Last month, Pai proposed scaling back regulation on ISPs and scheduled an FCC meeting on it for May 18. That regulation, now known as net neutrality, gives the FCC strict oversight and regulation of ISPs and puts them in the same category as utility companies. What is net neutrality? Here is the FCC's description: ""The FCC's Open Internet rules protect and maintain open, uninhibited access to legal online content without broadband Internet access providers being allowed to block, impair, or establish fast/slow lanes to lawful content."" In other words, your internet connection provider of choice, whether it's a cable company such as Time Warner Cable or a cellphone company such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ), cannot arbitrarily slow down, speed up, or block your connection based on what website you're on or how you're using the web. The new FCC proposal would still support an open internet, but specific net neutrality rules would be eliminated in lieu of a ""light-touch"" approach to oversight. The FCC invited comment from the public on the proposal in the period leading up to the May 18 meeting. Taking advantage of that invitation was comedian John Oliver, telling viewers of his comedy news show to use a website he set up, gofccyourself.com. The address took you to the FCC page where you could weigh in on the net neutrality debate. The day after the show, the FCC website went down, which it claims was not due to increased commenting volume but rather the result of a cyberattack. Funny business aside, this debate can be argued either way. Oliver, a champion of the net neutrality rules now in place, makes the point that if the FCC defangs itself, who would prevent ISPs from tampering with our portal to the internet? That's a valid concern, as there are cases of it happening  before the landmark ruling in 2015. And some of the ISPs could be more incentivized than ever to do so. Using Verizon as an example, the company bought AOL shortly after the net neutrality ruling in early 2015 and is closing in on purchasing Yahoo!. Some people worry the company, as a gatekeeper to the internet, could begin looking for ways to drive traffic to its new media sites. On the other side of the argument, there is concern that strict net neutrality rules have driven down investment in networks. However, ISPs have come out in support of net neutrality since the concept entered public awareness and have stated that the regulation doesn't affect how they invest in infrastructure. To back that up, Verizon and other mobile providers have been busy building out the infrastructure for next-generation networks called 5G. As part of this effort, Verizon bought out the ISP XO Communications for $1.8 billion last year and has followed it up this year with Straight Path Communications for over $3.1 billion. It hasn't all been about acquisitions either. Verizon recently signed a contract with Corning, a maker of materials for fiber optic line, for a minimum of $1.05 billion in new material through 2020 to help Verizon build its 5G infrastructure. Image source: Getty Images. I think the important takeaway here is that ISPs have moved on from this debate. They have found ways to continue expanding and improving internet service, so getting rid of net neutrality should theoretically be a non-issue. Many of them have also begun transforming themselves into media companies as well, diversifying revenue streams away from subscription internet services. Net neutrality or not, the plain-vanilla ISP business is as old and boring as a utility company. Should the rules cracking down on throttling of internet delivery be loosened, the ISPs should have already figured out by now that the ""tampering with the internet"" game isn't one they need to play.

    Is the Net Neutrality Debate as Important as It Used to Be? -- The Motley Fool

666,Leo Sun,5182017,Fool,5112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have rallied 30% since the beginning of the year, fueled by the company's robust growth in subscribers, revenue, and earnings. Wall Street expects those good times to continue, with 28% sales growth and 144% earnings growth this year. Netflix's strengths are easy to see -- it has an expanding lineup of critically acclaimed shows, its margins are improving as it relies less on licensed content, and its total paid subscribers rose 21% annually to 98.75 million last quarter. But investors should still be wary of one long-term threat which could throttle the growth of Netflix and other streaming platforms in the near future -- sponsored data. Image source: Netflix. ""Sponsored data"" refers to telecom companies like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exempting their own streaming content (or content from paid partners) from their own data caps. Critics claim that this strategy -- also known as ""zero rating"" -- violates net neutrality and gives ISPs an unfair advantage over streaming competitors if they evolve into media companies. AT&T and Verizon have already been making big investments in sponsored data. AT&T zero-rated its own streaming content from DirecTV and U-verse, enabling subscribers of its wireless and pay TV bundles to watch videos on multiple devices without worrying about data costs. AT&T also plans to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) once regulators approve the megamerger. AT&T recently added Time Warner's HBO as a free bonus to its unlimited wireless subscribers, and it might zero-rate that content for capped subscribers in the future as well. Last year, it launched FreeBee Data -- a platform that allows content providers to subsidize the data costs of streaming their content. Looking ahead, Verizon's planned acquisition of Yahoo's internet business -- which will be merged with AOL to create a new company called Oath -- will further expand that video ecosystem with fresh content. Over the past few years, ISPs noticed that customers were dumping their pay TV services in favor of broadband-only services to use with Netflix. This hurt ISPs in two big ways -- they were losing pay TV revenue and incurring higher expenses from hosting Netflix's massive streaming videos. Image source: Netflix. In response, the ISPs fired back by throttling Netflix's data transfers. Netflix protested the industrywide move, but eventually agreed to sign ""paid peering"" deals with AT&T, Verizon, and other ISPs to boost the network capacity of its streams. Those deals revealed that the ISPs still had tremendous leverage against Netflix -- controlling the pipes mattered more than controlling the content. This trend represents a long-term threat to Netflix, since people are watching an increasing number of streaming videos on mobile devices. Unfortunately, Netflix's two main responses to sponsored data programs haven't inspired much confidence. First, Netflix started throttling its own videos to 480p on AT&T and Verizon's mobile networks in early 2016, claiming that it was preventing users from exceeding their data caps. Second, Netflix allowed users to download videos to their devices for offline playback while they had a Wi-Fi connection. Unfortunately, those two fixes won't do much to counter ISPs if they zero-rate their own HD content. For example, AT&T could lure away Netflix subscribers, who might find it more appealing to simply subscribe to AT&T's internet and pay TV bundles -- which include DirecTV, HBO, and other major networks. Netflix certainly can't turn itself into a major ISP, so its best move is to simply produce more hit shows to lock in customers. But that strategy is getting pricey -- the company recently proposed a €1 billion ($1.09 billion) offering of senior notes for overseas investors to fund its original programs. Meanwhile, ISPs like AT&T and Verizon can simply use zero-rated content asloss leaders to gain wireless or pay TV subscribers. If the quality of Netflix's content starts slumping, it could lose customers to these carrier-backed streaming video ecosystems.  ","

667,Adam Levy,5182017,Fool,5112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The two largest U.S. cable operators are going to work together to take on the wireless telephone industry. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) entered an agreement that will allow them to collaborate as they both expand into wireless service. Comcast announced that its wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, will launch later this year. Charter may launch a similar service next year. Both will use Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireless network as well as public WiFi hotspots. The agreement stipulates that neither party can make an acquisition related to the wireless industry without the other's consent. So, if Comcast wanted to buy T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), for example, it couldn't do so without Charter signing off on it. It will also allow them to innovate more quickly since they'll share research and development, and leverage their combined forces in negotiations with Verizon or other wireless distributors for better rates. Image source: Comcast. The reason this agreement works is because Comcast and Charter will only sell their wireless service in the same markets where they sell television and internet service. That allows them to take advantage of existing marketing campaigns. Note that the service will work nationwide. The main strategy behind Comcast's Xfinity Mobile is to lock customers into bigger bundles and reduce subscriber churn. The pricing strongly incentivizes subscribing to Comcast's preferred bundle. Charter will likely offer something similar. The distinct territories in which Charter and Comcast operate means they won't be competing against each other for wireless customers. But their combined near-nationwide footprint means that they make a formidable competitor to the established nationwide wireless carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile. That makes the partnership not only viable, but a very smart move on the parts of Comcast and Charter. The stipulation that neither Comcast or Charter can make an acquisition without the other's consent means it's very unlikely either will get a deal done. It does open the door for a joint acquisition of a wireless provider, but that's somewhat farfetched. Importantly, it forces Verizon to look elsewhere for a tie-up. In the past, the company has been linked to both Charter and Comcast in merger and acquisition rumors. Ultimately, it should make Dish Network, with its treasure trove of wireless spectrum, that much more attractive to Verizon. That said, Verizon's management did recently say its network strength is just fine despite comments from T-Mobile's CEO that its network is slowing after launching an unlimited data plan. The move by Charter and Comcast also means T-Mobile isn't as big of a buyout candidate. Removing the cable giants from the table means it may try to merge with Sprint once again. The FCC blocked a merger last time, but the new administration has already proven to be much more lenient. It'll be interesting to see how the market plays out over the next year or so, now that companies are free to explore mergers and acquisitions following the quiet period induced by the FCC's 600 MHz spectrum auction. Investors hoping for an acquisition for either Verizon or T-Mobile just saw two big buyers practically take themselves out of the market. That's one reason it's always best not to invest based on acquisition rumors. ","

Thursday was a down day for the stock market, but major benchmarks recovered from much steeper losses earlier in the day. Political concerns bled into the financial markets in the morning session, and some pointed to uncertainty about the status of major government initiatives that investors have been quite pleased about in the recent rally. For the market as a whole, those concerns gave way to optimism about the prospects for the U.S. economy. But some pockets of weakness remained, and J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), and Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Shares of J.C. Penney dropped 7% on a tough day for the retail industry. Some of its department store retail peers, including Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Macy's (NYSE:M), reported ugly results. For Macy's, comparable-store sales declines of around 5% showed the pressure that even relatively healthy retailers are seeing, and Kohl's suffered a 3% drop in comps. Penney will report its results on Thursday, and investors will be watching to see if its strategic decision to start offering appliances and other new products will pay off not only in higher sales but also in greater profits. Given all the efforts that Penney has made recently, the retailer needs a win in order to reassure its shareholders that its long-term prospects are solid. Image source: J.C. Penney. Sears Holdings stock declined 10% after investors tried to digest irate comments from CEO Eddie Lampert at its annual shareholders' meeting on Wednesday. Lampert blamed negative media coverage for much of the difficulty that Sears has had in sustaining its business, including nervousness among suppliers and vendors that has led to more tense relationships. As J.C. Penney and its fellow retail industry players have seen, the environment for shopping mall anchor retailers has been extremely harsh, and it's not surprising to see Sears struggling at least as much as its counterparts. Nevertheless, shareholders didn't seem convinced by the argument, and the stock gave up some of the gains it made when Lampert and major institutional investor Fairholme Capital made substantial investments in Sears shares during March. Finally, shares of Straight Path Communications plunged nearly 21%. The communications company and holder of wireless spectrum assets said definitely that it would merge with Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), accepting its $184-per-share bid over an earlier bid from Verizon rival AT&T (NYSE:T). It might seem odd that Straight Path fell on that news, but investors had sent the stock price well above the value of the Verizon bid, thinking that AT&T would increase its offer and start a longer bidding war. However, AT&T didn't make a higher counteroffer within the required period, and so traders who had bet on more upside took a substantial hit. Going forward, if the deal gets necessary approvals, Straight Path's spectrum will be of use to Verizon as it develops new advanced networks. Meanwhile, AT&T will pocket a termination fee and is likely seek other spectrum holders to beef up its own portfolio going forward. ","

669,"Anders Bylund, Chuck Saletta, and Brian Feroldi",5182017,Fool,5112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here at The Motley Fool, you can get started investing in the stock market with the help of our 13-step beginner's program. Choosing to invest at all is an important first step, so congratulations on making it this far! But what stocks should a new investor look at first? We asked three top contributors to The Motley Fool the same question. Read on to see why our panelists believe that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) belong in any brand-new investor's starting portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Chuck Saletta (Verizon Communications): Verizon's business runs the gamut in telecommunications. It operates lowly old wireline telephones, high-speed internet and cable delivered through a fiber optic network, and the wireless networks that connect cellphones and other mobile devices.  Even if you don't directly use its services, you've very likely both heard of the company and know someone who does. Verizon's broad reach and established market positions in fairly mature industries mean the market isn't expecting much growth from the company. In fact, analysts estimate about 2.5% per year earnings growth over the next five years, a small but positive anticipated upward trend. Fortunately, the market's modest expectations are also pretty well reflected in its market price. Verizon's shares are trading at around twelve times its forward looking estimated earnings. That reasonable valuation combined with a 5% dividend yield that's covered by both its past and expected earnings makes Verizon a company worth considering as an investment for a rookie investor. It probably won't set the world on fire with a tremendous total return. Still, its dividend should hand investors cash back on a regular basis, and there's a potential for modest value increases over time if its business delivers on that expected growth. Anders Bylund (Walt Disney): ""Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon,"" said investing guru Peter Lynch. I can't think of a stock that fits this classic maxim better than Walt Disney. You don't need me to explain what Disney is, what the company does, or how investors can benefit from one of the strongest brands in the world. Grab a crayon and do it yourself. It's really that simple. Maybe it isn't immediately obvious how Disney wrings every last penny of investor value out of its core movie business. In short, excellent storytelling begets rabid fans. These highly committed fans won't think twice about spending money on Marvel and Pixar movie tickets, in the company's global network of theme parks and cruise ships, and on licensed merchandise such as T-shirts, lunch boxes, and bed sheets. This is what Disney does better than anyone else. It starts with top-quality movies and TV shows, and the company tends to lasso in its target audience at a young and impressionable age. Then it's just a simple matter of exploiting that brand loyalty from every possible angle. As long as the company's creative talent stays on board, I think just about anybody could run Disney effectively. The main gist of this business is immediately obvious to any beginning investor, and then you can learn all the finer details with a few Disney shares comfortably tucked in your pocket. It doesn't take much more than a crayon or two to explain the House of Mouse. Brian Feroldi (Home Depot): Retailers offer investors a simple business model that makes them a great place for new investors to search for their first stock. However, the retail world has recently been turned on its head as e-commerce companies continue to take market share. That's why it is important as ever for investors to be choosy about which retailer they buy. One retailer that continues to thrive is today's ever-changing environment is Home Depot. The home-improvement king sells products that are bulky and often needed immediately, which helps to protect its business from internet competition. When combined with Home Depot's operational excellence, strong brand, and knack for offering helpful customer service, it has had no problem cranking out strong quarterly results. Despite its massive size, there are reasons to believe that Home Depot's growth engine will continue to hum along from here. The housing market remains strong and the company's digital business continues to grow rapidly. When combined with its healthy share repurchase program and continued margin improvements, Home Depot's bottom line looks poised for double-digit growth. That's a compelling story for a company that dominates its industry and offers up a juicy dividend yield of 2.3%. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

Image source: Getty Images. Megamergers aren't very common, but when they happen, the numbers involved are truly massive. For example, Exxon's $79 billion merger with Mobil doesn't even crack the top seven deals of all time in terms of value. Here's a list of seven deals that were bigger. Image source: Getty Images. In the late 1990s, mobile phones were becoming mainstream, and that was fueling excitement among telecom providers, including Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). Vodafone spent $60 billion buying AirTouch, a U.S. cellular company, in 1999, and subsequently, it launched a contentious battle to buy German telecom giant Mannesmann in 2000. Sadly, this big merger was a big dud. After Mannesmann rejected Vodafone's first offer, Vodafone had to nearly double its offer to about $180 billion to get this deal done. Unfortunately, the combination didn't work out the way Vodafone hoped, and as a result, it had to write off tens of billions of dollars in the following years because of it. Image source: Getty Images. Before blazing-fast Internet was offered by cable companies, most Americans used their landline phone service to access the Internet via America Online, or AOL. Founded by Steve Case, a technology visionary, AOL became one of the biggest technology companies in America, and that success led to media giant Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) forking out a staggering sum to acquire it in 2000. Unfortunately, broadband Internet access ultimately left AOL's dial-up service in the cold, and big differences in culture caused major problems integrating the two companies. Synergies (and growth) that had been promised never materialized, and eventually that caused large write-offs. Ultimately, AOL was spun off with market value of only $3.5 billion. Image source: Getty Images. Remember how Vodafone bought AirTouch in the late 1990s? Well, shortly thereafter, it cut a deal with Bell Atlantic -- now Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ)-- to combine AirTouch with Bell Atlantic's wireless business to create Verizon Wireless. Verizon Wireless went on to become a dominant force in U.S. wireless services, and in 2013, Vodafone sold its 45% stake in it to Verizon for $59 billion in cash and $60 billion in Verizon shares. That's a pretty good return on the $60 billion Vodafone initially spent on AirTouch. Image source: Getty Images. RFS Holdings was a three-bank consortium spear-headed by Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) that acquired the Netherlands banking powerhouse ABN Amro right before the global financial crisis (talk about bad timing!). RBS, the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, and Banco Santander paid the now unbelievable sum of three times book value to acquire ABN Amro in 2007. RBS landed ABN Amro's London investment banking business, plus some Asian operations. Fortis got ABN Amro's Dutch banking, asset management, and private banking businesses. Santander walked away with assets in Italy and Brazil. The bad timing -- and the steep price -- made this acquisition a big bust. Fortis ended up being nationalized, and two big bailouts left the British Treasury owning two-thirds of RBS. In addition to writing off assets acquired in the ABN Amro deal, RBS has lost an astonishing 58 billion pounds since 2008. Image source: Getty Images. Combining these two companies created a brewing behemoth boasting over $55 billion in annual sales that's responsible for nearly 3 of every 10 beers sold worldwide. But, since this deal only happened last year, it will be a while before we know if it's a success or a failure. AB InBev (NYSE:BUD) and SABMiller were forced to sell some of their brands to secure regulatory approval for their tie-up, but the deal has made AB InBev a much bigger player in emerging markets, including China, and the company thinks those markets will be a big driver of future growth. Only time will tell if sales growth in the Middle Kingdom and beyond ends up justifying this deal's lofty cost. Image source: Getty Images. Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) acquisition of Warner-Lambert in 2000 created the planet's second-biggest drug company, but it wasn't just scale that was behind this deal. Pfizer's interest in Warner-Lambert was driven predominately by Warner-Lambert's top-selling cholesterol drug, Lipitor. Pfizer had commercial rights to Lipitor, but Pfizer was splitting profits on it with Warner-Lambert, and in 1999, Warner-Lambert sued Pfizer to end their licensing pact. Pfizer's acquisition removed the risk of losing out on Lipitor, and since Lipitor's sales ended up growing from about $5 billion annually to more than $13 billion annually, gaining full control over it was smart -- especially since this acquisition was an all-stock deal. Image source: Getty Images. When AT&T (NYSE:T) announced its acquisition of BellSouth in 2006, it emphasized billions of dollars in potential cost savings, but Cingular Wireless -- the wireless company shared by the two telecom providers -- was the real reason behind this combination. In the mid-2000s, Cingular Wireless was the biggest wireless provider in the U.S., with 54 million customers. AT&T owned 60% of it, so it was already a big beneficiary of Cingular's success. However, AT&T recognized that telecom market was moving toward a convergence of television, computers, and wireless accessibility, and that made acquiring the remaining 40% of Cingular that BellSouth owned very important to it. Today, smartphones and tablets are commonly used to access entertainment wirelessly, and  AT&T's mobility segment represents 43% of the company's total revenue. In my book, that makes this a smart deal for AT&T. ","

671,Keith Speights,5182017,Fool,5112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Warren Buffett would be the first to admit that not every stock pick he makes is successful. Although most of the holdings in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio have done pretty well this year, there are several stocks that haven't. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) currently rank as Buffett's worst stocks of 2017 so far. Here's why. Image source: The Motley Fool. Verizon has been Warren Buffett's worst stock by far in 2017. Shares of the telecommunications provider have fallen 13% year to date. To Buffett's credit, though, he sold most of his stake in Verizon in the fourth quarter of 2016. His current position in the stock doesn't even amount to a rounding error in Berkshire's financial figures, making Verizon the smallest stake Berkshire has in any company. The big problems for Verizon are that its revenue and earnings are declining. Verizon's wireless business is especially struggling. After holding out longer than its major rivals, the company finally decided to offer unlimited data plans to wireless customers in the first quarter. That could help Verizon keep more of its subscribers and even attract new ones. I don't expect Buffett to buy more shares anytime soon, though. General Electric (GE) stock is down close to 9% so far in 2017, making it Buffett's second-worst stock of the year. Unlike Verizon, though, GE's bottom line improved considerably in the first quarter compared to the prior year period. So why have GE shares dipped? The primary issue for the blue-chip industrial giant is that its industrial cash flow from operations (CFOA) for the first quarter was $1 billion below expectations. One reason for the CFOA shortfall was lower receivables, in part due to delinquent accounts in regions such as the Middle East. Another relates to timing of contracts. GE also had lower healthcare sales than expected, which resulted in less reduction of inventory. Like GE, IBM stock is down around 9% this year. Buffett was once enchanted with the technology company, but that's not the case anymore. He recently announced that Berkshire had sold roughly one-third of its stake in IBM. Why has Warren Buffett lost confidence in the tech company? He says that he was overly optimistic about how IBM would perform and now values the stock lower. IBM is still very profitable and generates huge revenue, but both its top and bottom lines have declined in recent years. The company does expect to return to earnings growth this year, but revenue will remain sluggish. UPS' share price has fallen around 8% in 2017 so far. That's not too concerning for Buffett, however, since Berkshire has only a small stake in the package delivery giant. The reason behind UPS' dismal year-to-date stock performance stems from its disappointing fourth-quarter 2016 results announced in late January. Revenue grew, but adjusted operating profit for the company's U.S. domestic package and supply chain & freight businesses decreased from the prior-year period. Even though UPS beat revenue and earnings expectations with its first-quarter 2017 results, it wasn't enough to serve as a big catalyst for the stock. Phillips 66 stock is down around 7% this year. It could have been worse for Buffett, though. The oil company's shares were down more than 12% in April. A poor performance in the fourth quarter of 2016 hurt Phillips 66 earlier in the year. The company badly missed earnings expectations due in large part to higher costs. However, Phillips 66 rebounded in the first quarter of 2017 -- handily beating the consensus analysts' estimate thanks to solid results from its chemicals business and higher midstream earnings. Although these stocks have declined in 2017, it probably doesn't bother Warren Buffett much. He's more concerned about the fundamentals of each company's business than temporary movements in the share prices. I suspect that most, if not all, of these stocks will make Buffett and Berkshire plenty of money over the long run. His stock picks usually do. ","

674,Mark Hulbert,5182017,MarketWatch,5112017,"Published: May 16, 2017 4:48 p.m. ET A look at whether low-volatility stocks will continue to live up to their impressive past By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Some skeptics recently have argued that low-volatility stocks are forming a bubble that’s about to pop — and financial advisers therefore need to stop recommending them to their clients. And since a lot is riding on this disagreement, it’s important to get to the bottom of it. Low-volatility stocks are those that have exhibited low levels of historical price volatility. Though there is no one way in which analysts define volatility, the definition used by the late Robert Haugen — the finance professor who devoted much of his three-decade academic career to documenting the impressive performance of such stocks — is the standard deviation of monthly returns over the trailing two years. Such stocks exhibit two characteristics that make them valuable to investors. The first: They tend to continue being low volatility and less risky than the overall market. In fact, one of the strongest patterns statisticians have documented in the stock market is the high correlation between a ranking of stocks based on their volatility in one period and a ranking based on their volatility in a subsequent period. This means that investors can reliably expect that a portfolio of stocks with low past volatility will continue to exhibit low volatility. The second notable characteristic of low-volatility stocks is even more extraordinary: In the past they on average performed every bit as well as the market as a whole, if not better, and significantly better than the highest-volatility stocks. Professor Haugen was met with considerable skepticism when he first reported this result, since it flew directly in the face of what Finance 101 taught us about the relationship between risk and return. But this pattern was the consistent finding of a number of subsequent studies, both of U.S. stocks but also of stocks around the world. Taking these two characteristics together, it meant that you could equal the market, if not beat it, while incurring substantially below-market risk. That’s a winning combination. No wonder that financial planners have been urging low-volatility stocks to their risk-averse clients. Imagine such an investor who has previously concluded he should allocate only 50% of his portfolio to the broad stock market. For ease of illustration, assume that this client has allocated the other 50% of his portfolio to a money-market fund. To appreciate what low-volatility stocks can do for this investor, consider the iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA ETF

                                   , which is the largest of the several ETFs that invest in such stocks in the U.S. Its beta is 0.74, according to MSCI, which means that it historically has fallen 26% less than the S&P 500 during bear markets. Yet since the index’s inception in 1988, it has produced a 10% annualized return, versus 9.74% for the S&P 500. Assuming the future is like the past, that client could instead invest 68% of his portfolio in the USMV and incur no additional risk. But his return would be dramatically better, since 18% of his portfolio that was otherwise earning a money market rate would now be earning an expected rate of 10.0% annualized. But will the future continue to be like the past? That is the $64,000 question, since no strategy works forever in the wake of ever-increasing popularity. One adviser who believes we’ve reached that point is Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts. Earlier this month, he wrote to clients that low-volatility stocks are in a bubble, since their average P/E ratios currently are much higher than in the past. For an additional perspective, I checked in with Nardin Baker, who co-authored with Professor Haugen many of the seminal research studies into the performance of low-volatility stocks. Baker currently is Chief Strategist at South Street Investment Advisors in Boston; he previously was a global equity manager at Guggenheim Partners. Mr. Baker acknowledged in an interview that low-volatility stocks today are trading at higher valuations than they often have in the past. But, Mr. Baker quickly added, that doesn’t mean the low-volatility approach isn’t still compelling. That’s for two reasons. The first: Low volatility isn’t merely a proxy for low P/E. If that were the case, then it would be more alarming that low-volatility stocks are now trading for higher P/E ratios. But the low-volatility approach is more than that. To be sure, there have been times in the past when the lowest-volatility stocks also sported some of the lowest P/Es. This was the case in the early aughts, for example, when value stocks dominated the low-volatility universe. But in recent years the low-volatility universe has drawn fairly evenly from both the value- and growth-stock camps, and as a result such stocks’ average P/E has risen. But that’s no reason to conclude that the low-volatility approach has stopped working. The second reason that Mr. Baker argues the low-volatility approach remains compelling: Such stocks would have to trade at much higher valuations before it would be rational to avoid them. Imagine, for purposes of illustration, that low-volatility stocks in the future lag the S&P 500 by a percentage point per year. That would represent a change, of course, since historically such stocks have equaled or beaten the broad market. But notice that they would still handily beat the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis: They will forfeit 10% of the market’s return while immunizing followers from 26% of the risk. That means you still will be able to improve your long-term returns, without any additional risk, by increasing your allocation to low-volatility stocks. How much more expensive would low-volatility stocks have to become before they would no longer hold out the potential of beating the broad market on a risk-adjusted basis? Mr. Baker estimates that their average P/E ratios would have to be 30% higher than the S&P 500’s before this would be the case. Since they currently are just 5% higher, Mr. Baker concludes that low-volatility stocks still have a lot to offer. To be sure, none of this discussion should be taken to mean that P/E ratios don’t also matter. Between two low-volatility stocks between which you are otherwise indifferent, the one with the lower P/E would certainly seem the better alternative.

675,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 on Thursday to advance a Republican plan to reverse the Obama administration’s 2015 “net neutrality” order. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai wants the commission repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. “We propose to repeal utility-style regulation,” Pai said on  Thursday. “This is the right way to go.” Stocks of major internet providers rose on Thursday. The public will have until mid-August to offer comments before the FCC votes on a final plan. Pai wants public input on whether the FCC has the authority or should keep its “bright line” rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving “fast lanes” to some websites. Pai declined on Thursday to commit to retaining any rules, but said he favors an “open internet.” He added he would make public a final proposal before a final vote. Democratic FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, who voted against the plan, said the end game appears to be an internet without FCC regulatory oversight. She said the proposal “jeopardizes the ability of the open internet to function tomorrow, as it does today.” Many companies and Republicans think Congress should pass legislation clarifying the FCC’s role to resolve a decade-long dispute over internet regulations. The FCC, which has already received more than 1 million comments, is also seeking comment on whether U.S. states should be able to set their own internet regulations governing broadband privacy and other issues. Providers insist they will not engage in blocking or throttling even in the absence of rules, but critics are skeptical. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat, said “it will take millions of people standing up, just like they did before, to say that the internet needs to stay free and open. That’s what it will take to win.” ","

677,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 Telecommunications Services Sector index as-we-know it may have to hang up on investors, as its creators are considering a restructuring of the once-hot index which has shrunk to just four companies from 14. After years of consolidation and diversification, today’s telecommunications sector would be unrecognizable to investors in the index, which was created in 1996. The index could be three stocks in the third quarter. “The telecom sector has evolved,” said David Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee, S&P Dow Jones Indices. “We have been discussing how these changes are impacting the market and expect to consult with investors in the near future.” Back in 1996, AT&T’s network carried long-distance calls over the wired network. Verizon Communications - then called Bell Atlantic - made most of its money connecting local calls. Cellphones were a luxury for many, and companies were still figuring out how the internet might be most useful. Fast forward to 2017, telecom companies are desperately trying to diversify with non-traditional services like TV and home security as they are now largely dependent on the highly competitive cellphone and internet industry for revenue. Mergers will further shrink the percentage of revenue from traditional telecommunications as AT&T Inc - the sector’s biggest company - has eyes on media company Time Warner Inc. Regional telecom operator CenturyLink Inc plans to buy Level 3 in the third quarter, a deal that would leave the index with just three companies. Unlike the other 10 sectors, the S&P 500 telecom segment is so small there is not a single exchange-traded fund (ETF) that mirrors it because a fund holding just a few stocks would fall short of regulatory requirements. Instead, the telecom ETFs that do exist include smaller telecom companies outside the S&P 500 and firms in the technology industry. The index currently represents just 2 percent of the S&P’s market value down from 9 percent at its peak in 1999. But the path to reorganizing the index is not so clear cut for S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc, which together manage the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) industry taxonomy for indexes. MSCI declined to comment. S&P Dow Jones Indices is a venture of S&P Global Inc and CME Group Inc. Options could include an expansion of the current index with competitors such as cable operators or an absorption of telecom companies into another S&P sector such as consumer discretionary, technology or utilities. The telecommunications sector’s biggest competitors in the S&P 500 are cable operators Comcast Corp and Charter Communications, while media rivals include online services such as Netflix Inc. These companies are in the consumer discretionary index. But cable companies are regulated differently and have different service offerings than telecom companies, so they may not be an exact match for a new index. Including AT&T and Verizon in the consumer discretionary index would be a massive change for that sector as AT&T would be the second biggest company by market value behind only Amazon.com, while Verizon would be the fourth biggest company, just behind Home Depot. Since slow-growing telecom operators are notable for their high dividend yields, some investors including David Haviland, managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management in Needham, Massachusetts, say they should be added to the utilities index. So far, investors have not been banging on S&P’s door looking for an elimination of the sector, according to S&P’s Blitzer. But many do question its relevance. “Four companies does not a sector make,” said Haviland, who uses the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund for telecom exposure. “The viability of a three-company sector is highly questionable.” ","

Going public allows Altice’s founder, French billionaire Patrick Drahi, to expand his budding U.S. cable empire by giving Altice USA public stock it can use to finance more acquisitions. Asked what U.S. assets he would look at, Drahi told reporters at a meeting on Tuesday that he considered cable expansion a priority, followed by mobile and content. “We’re too small in cable to go into mobile at the moment.” Altice is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider, with 4.9 million customers. It completed its $17.7 billion acquisition of Cablevision last June, after buying Suddenlink for $9.1 billion in 2015. Altice has said it is considering ways to enter the wireless business as other cable providers prepare to offer mobile services. “We are having discussions on lots of different types of alternatives out there,” Dexter Goei, chief executive of Altice USA, told reporters on Monday in remarks embargoed for Tuesday. Goei called the partnership between the two companies “interesting and innovative,” adding, “we’re clearly not the types of people to sit back and watch.” Asked whether his company would consider joining the Comcast-Charter alliance, he said, “I don’t think there is a necessity for us to join anything today.” Altice USA’s parent company also said on Tuesday it planned to rebrand Optimum, formerly known as Cablevision, and Suddenlink, as well as most of the other businesses under its umbrella, as Altice by mid-2018.

679,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed China Mobile Limited's (CML) Long-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+'. The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Dominant Mobile Market Position: The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that CML would be able to maintain its dominant position in China's mobile market over the medium term due to its significant economies of scale, robust financial position and solid execution ability. In 2016, CML's mobile service revenue market share remained high at 67%. At end-April 2017, it controlled subscriber share of 64% and 68% for all mobile and 4G services, respectively. The company also utilises its strength in mobile services to develop its broadband business, controlling a subscriber share of 28% at end-April 2017, based on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's data. Government-Directed Tariff Cuts: Further tariff reductions directed by the government may affect CML's revenue and EBITDA growth in 2017. However, we believe that the overall impact should be manageable for CML, as we expect to see continued favourable price elasticity. We believe this round of government-directed tariff cuts is less severe than the previous round in 2015. Chinese operators each pledged to substantially reduce dedicated internet access tariffs for small- and medium-sized enterprises and international long-distance call tariffs, and from 1 October 2017, cease to charge domestic long-distance and roaming fees for their mobile subscribers. Solid Profitability: We expect CML's EBITDA margin to remain solid at around 35%-36%, despite some pressure in 2017 due to utility- and labour-cost inflation and increased competition on 4G from the other two Chinese operators. CML's EBITDA margin rebounded to 36% in 1Q17, from 34% in 4Q16, after higher year-end customer retention and faster phasing-out of domestic long-distance and roaming fees in 2H16. We expect rising data demand, lower handset subsidies and improvement in the tower company's efficiency to help mitigate margin pressure. Declining Capex: CML's pre-dividend FCF margin should expand to over 14% in 2017-2019 as capex decreases. Fitch expects the company to continue to accumulate excess cash despite an increase in dividend payout ratio to 46% from 43%. CML will cut capex in 2017 to CNY176 billion as 4G investment declines. We forecast further capex cuts in 2018 and perhaps 2019. CML may start to spend on 5G capex slightly earlier than the other Chinese operators. However, we believe the majority of China's 5G capex is some years away; investment may start from 2019 at the earliest, but initial 5G spending is likely to be limited. Constrained by Sovereign Ratings: CML's ratings are constrained by China's sovereign rating (A+/Stable) as CML is ultimately controlled by the state. CML's standalone rating is 'AA-'. CML is 73%-owned by China Mobile Communications Corporation, which is 100%-owned by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. DERIVATION SUMMARY CML's standalone rating of 'AA-' remains the highest among all Fitch's telecoms credits, but its rating is constrained by China's sovereign ratings (A+/Stable). CML has significantly stronger market position and more substantial net cash position than its global peers. Its credit profile remains stronger than that of global and local telecoms peers, including China Telecom Corporation Limited (A+/Stable), Singapore Telecommunications Limited (A+/Stable), SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (A-/Stable), Telekom Malaysia Berhad (A-/Stable), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable) and AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - around mid-single digit revenue growth with rising data revenue offsetting the decline in voice revenue - operating EBITDAR margin at 43%-44% in two to three years - capex of CNY176 billion in 2017 and CNY160 billion-190 billion in 2018-2019 - dividend payout ratio at 46% RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A positive sovereign rating action Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Downgrade of the Standalone Rating to 'A+' - Reversal of its net cash position - Pre-dividend FCF margin falling below 8% on a sustained basis - Operating EBITDAR margin falling below 40% on a sustained basis CML has high rating headroom and Fitch therefore does not envisage a downgrade of the standalone rating to 'A+' from 'AA-' over the medium term. As CML's ratings are constrained by the sovereign's rating, any downgrade of the sovereign will lead to a corresponding downgrade in CML's ratings. LIQUIDITY Abundant Liquidity: At end-December 2016, CML's unrestricted cash balance of CNY426 billion far exceeded its interest-bearing borrowing of CNY5 billion. CML has no maturities due before October 2017. Debt Structure: Its debt totalled CNY5 billion at end-2016 (end-2015: CNY5bn), which consisted of the unsecured long-term bonds guaranteed by China Mobile Communications Corporation due in 2017.

681,Billy Duberstein,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Only a little more than a month ago, Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP) stock was at $36 per share. Last week, however, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) agreed to buy the company in an all-stock deal for $184, a whopping 404% premium to where the little-known, nine-employee company was trading on April 7. That's because AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon were involved in a bidding war for Straight Path's high-band spectrum assets, which may be the building blocks of a future 5G network. As I previously wrote, AT&T and Verizon are competing to assume pole position in the 5G race because their core wireless businesses are in trouble, due to the incredible success of low-cost provider T-Mobile. AT&T and Verizon are still much bigger so they are attempting to leverage their scale to be the leader in the next wave of innovation and differentiate their service based on quality. Right now, both Sprint and T-Mobile have upgraded their networks to a similar level of quality as the bigger players, so that advantage has waned. It is perhaps fitting that Verizon won this bidding war, as the new 5G is most crucial to its future. 5G is also important to AT&T, but the company has more diversification than Verizon, with a large media arm due to its acquisition of Direct TV and the pending acquisition of Time Warner, a larger enterprise fiber network, and a growing Latin American division. T-Mobile has promised a 5G network by 2020 as well. It believes that it will be able to deploy 5G on the low-band spectrum it purchased in the government auction this winter, when it spent $8 billion for lots of low-band 600 MHz spectrum. It's still unclear how comprehensive that network will be, however. Verizon, however, seems to be betting on leading technological innovation of the core network. There is still a debate about what 5G is and what it will mean. Perhaps the most bullish and intriguing thesis is that 5G could eventually replace cable companies' fixed broadband delivery. That would be an incredible boon for companies with 5G capabilities and a potential danger for players such as Comcast and Charter, which dominate this space. Interestingly, those two companies recently teamed up to offer wireless service and coordinate on similar technology platforms going forward. This is intriguing, and could be due to this potential threat as wireless operators move into cable and vice versa. Image source: Getty Images. Cowen & Co.'s analyst Colby Synesael recently discussed this phenomenon in a 25-minute video, in which he concludes that 5G could very well be a cable killer, but will not arrive until 2020 or later, and then only in developed countries such as the U.S. Also, the 5G buildout is likely to be complex and expensive. In the presentation, he notes that 5G will initially incorporate millimeter-wave spectrum (the kind that Straight Path owned), but will eventually be available on all spectrum waves. The government is likely to open up even more spectrum for 5G deployments in the years ahead. One might ask, then, why Verizon just paid $2.2 billion for these spectrum assets, when 5G will eventually become available on mid-band spectrum as well. Probably because even at $2.2 billion, the price paid for Straight Path's spectrum amounted to a rate of less than a penny per megahertz per person. This is in contrast to the recent auction the Federal Communications Commission held for the 600 MHz band, where that spectrum went for $0.93 per MHz-POP. So, Verizon is paying up now to likely be the first -- though not the only -- company to build out 5G, which will require this millimeter-wave spectrum for the first part of the network. Verizon shelled out $2.2 billion in stock for spectrum that will allow it to be a leader in the race for 5G. It's still unclear how much this will mean for its network superiority and its earnings in the 2020s, but investors need to keep an eye on the 5G race, as it will likely transform many big industries as we know them.

682,Brian Stoffel,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If there was one class of stocks retirees could always count on to provide regular income in the past, it was telecoms. While the investments in infrastructure these companies have to make are onerous, the businesses had huge moats: the aforementioned costs, long-term contracts, and -- often -- government sanctioned monopolies. However, over the last 20 years, that's all been turned on its head. In the age of mobile communications, landlines are a liability -- not an asset. And yet, the two telecoms we're matching up today -- Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) -- still have huge dividends: both yielding over 8%! Image source: Getty Images. Which is the better buy? That's an impossible question to answer with 100% certainty. But as you'll see below, there are three key ways we can approach the question. That should help give us clarity as to which is a better deal at today's prices. Simply put, there's nothing more important than a company's sustainable competitive advantages -- often referred to as its ""moat."" A solid moat is what differentiates a company from the competition and promises to keep it that way for the foreseeable future. As I said at the outset, the barriers to entry in telecom are high, as infrastructure costs are onerous. Since both of these companies are established players, that doesn't really serve as a differentiator. Frontier used to be primarily focused on landline businesses in rural America. Obviously, that's a dying business -- and so it has expanded out by focusing on two areas: providing Internet services to businesses, and buying up the Internet properties of AT&T and Verizon in Connecticut, Texas, California, and Florida. Unfortunately, those acquisitions aren't panning out very well, with the company losing customers at a brisk clip. CenturyLink also focuses on providing Internet and voice services. But its plan to acquire Level3 Communications (NYSE:LVLT) shows a shifting strategy. With the acquisition, CenturyLink would become one of the largest Internet providers in the nation -- able to sell its Internet capacity to rivals for a premium. While I'm not terribly excited about either company's moat, I think CenturyLink's is much wider as Frontier's, as the latter's inability to hold onto customers from its acquisitions shows just how narrow the moat is. Telecom investors make a crucial trade-off: They're willing to buy companies that have heavy debt-loads because there's lots of free cash flow (FCF) coming through that's passed on to them in the form of dividends. But it's still important to keep cash on hand. That's because every company, at one point or another, will experience difficult economic times. Those with cash on hand have options: to buy back shares on the cheap, continue paying a dividend, or even make strategic acquisitions. Debt-heavy companies are in the opposite boat, forced to figure out ways to stay solvent. Keeping in mind that CenturyLink is valued at over eight times the size of Frontier, here's how the two stack up. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow CenturyLink $0.2 billion $18.7 billion $0.6 billion $1.1 billion Frontier $0.3 billion $17.5 billion ($0.5 billion) $0.6 billion Data source: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance. To be honest, both of these balance sheets look pretty awful: very little cash, and a mountain of debt. Additionally, while there is FCF coming in, it's hardly enough to give investors confidence that the companies would be unscathed in the face of an economic downturn. Finally, we have valuation. While we don't have a one-size-fits-all metric to compare any two companies, we can use multiple data points to make an informed analysis. Company P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Dividend Yield FCF Payout CenturyLink 11 12 N/A 8.7% 107% Frontier N/A 3 N/A 12.4% 126% Here we have a very interesting case. Both stocks appear to be very cheap. But it's important to note that for most investors, it's all about the dividend. And in terms of dividend sustainability, neither appears to be doing quite well. Frontier slashed its dividend recently, and both CenturyLink and Frontier have paid out more in dividends over the past 12 months than they have brought in from FCF. That's not sustainable, and it should make investors think twice before falling in love with those outsized dividend yields. That being the case, I'm going with Frontier, here. Despite its recent payout reduction, and even though the company's FCF isn't terribly impressive, the stock is priced so incredibly low -- at three times FCF -- that there's a lot of pessimism already baked into the stock's price. So, there you have it: We've got a tie. Both stocks look cheap, have questionable balance sheets, and pretty narrow moats. But whenever there's a tie, I always side with the company with stronger competitive advantages. In this case, that's CenturyLink. If you're looking for outsized dividends, it might be worth investigating CenturyLink, but I also suggest you find companies that have more sustainable payouts for your portfolio. ","

The company of course still pays taxes, but if it advertises four lines for $160, that's actually the price consumers pay for the service. That's much different from how the other wireless companies operate, two of which -- AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) -- also sell cable and internet service. Legere, who never misses a chance to mock his two big rivals, went right after them in a press release when T-Mobile's offer was introduced. He was only speaking about wireless; he made no mention of cable or internet, though he might as well have: Wireless consumers pay billions extra every year in added surcharges, taxes, monthly fees and carrier price hikes. It's reached epidemic proportions! And, the carriers just keep inventing new ways to make their customers pay. Below are five of the most egregious ways many cable, internet, and wireless companies may be charging their customers more than their advertised prices. These aren't the only tricks up these companies' sleeves, but they are the most common -- and probably the most expensive. You don't have to rent a cable modem. Image source: Getty Images. In many cases cable companies, including Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), charge a monthly rental fee -- generally between $6 and $10 a month -- to rent a cable modem. What many cable providers don't explicitly tell you is that this is not a mandatory charge. Instead of renting a modem and paying its full cost many times over its lifespan, you can buy your own. The companies that offer modem rentals generally have Web pages that list alternatives, and some smaller players will actually sell you one up front at a fair price if you elect to buy it. For consumers, this is a no-brainer. Cable modems generally cost under $100, and while it's not fun to pay that up front, it makes a lot more sense than spending that much or more each year. Many cable companies charge extra fess for broadcast networks and sports channels that are not optional. Image source: Pixabay. Another cable and satellite add-on fee, the broadcast network fee is an attempt by these companies to recoup the money they pay to retransmit ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX. The problem with this fee, which is generally between $2 and $5 (though it can be more), is that it's not disclosed when companies advertise prices. For example, a cable or satellite company may advertise a $99-per-month package offering 100 channels. What they neglect to mention is that you won't actually pay $99 a month, or even $99 a month plus tax, because the broadcast network fee is added on on top of the base price. Overage fees have amounted to billions in profits from AT&T and Verizon. Image source: Getty Images. While unlimited plans have started to make overage fees a thing of the past, many AT&T and Verizon customers who opt for metered data plans still pay them. An overage fee is a charge consumers pay when they use more than their allotted data amount. Sometimes consumers aren't even notified they have gone over, nor are they offered the option of simply waiting until the next month before using any more data. AT&T and Verizon have made billions by charging consumers overage fees -- and convincing customers to buy more data than they need in order to avoid those charges. Now, in the cable space, Comcast is getting in on the game: In some markets, it caps internet usage and charges overage fees when subscribers exceed that allotment. Some cable companies charge extra mandatory fees for sports networks they also own. Image source: Comcast. Much like the broadcast network fee, the regional sports fee is a charge that some cable and satellite providers add to the base price they advertise. In this case, the added charge goes toward paying for regional sports networks, some of which are owned by the cable companies themselves. This fee may be even more egregious than the broadcast fee, because many of the people forced to pay it would simply choose not to get these channels if that were a choice. Instead, consumers are forced to pay a few extra dollars each month for channels they may not watch -- and in some cases, that money goes directly to the same company selling them pay television.

    4 Sneaky Fees You May Be Paying to Your Wireless, Cable, or Internet Provider -- The Motley Fool

684,Billy Duberstein,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investors in the telephone or cable industries have had a tumultuous year -- unless they've picked a very small handful of winners. Telecom giants AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) have been hit hard by low-priced upstart T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and are now in the midst of a vicious pricing war despite the existence of only four national carriers. Cable companies have been able to grow with increased broadband use, but those with large media arms have been hit by the cord-cutting phenomenon resulting from the rise of streaming services. Given these headwinds, most of the industry is looking hard at acquisitions to expand capabilities and lower costs. Now that a certain milestone has passed, the time for acquisitions may be now. Let's look at who may be flirting with whom. Image source: Getty Images. The end of March marked the end of a multistage wireless-spectrum auction. Wireless companies agreed to pay $19.77 billion for 70 Mhz of spectrum that television broadcasters sold for around $10 billion. The government -- which pocketed the spread -- compelled broadcasters to sell, since wireless had the need and many people now receive their broadcast channels by cable or satellite. This spectrum auction was a long process, and during the bidding period, telecom and cable companies weren't allowed to speak with each other about bidding strategies, mergers, and acquisitions. Now that it's over, telecom companies can talk to each other about hooking up. The company in the catbird seat is T-Mobile. It's earned a reputation as a low-cost disrupter in the space, and its stock has increased 60% in the past year. T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S) tried to merge in the recent past, but the Obama administration preferred to keep the number of wireless-carrier choices at four instead of three. Now that the more business-friendly Trump administration is in power and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is in charge, the common wisdom is that more mergers will be allowed. On the recent quarterly earnings call, T-Mobile CEO John Legere pointed to M&A as a potential benefit to both T-Mobile's own business and its customer, but reiterated that the company didn't need to do something: ""[F]irst of all, we should be clear that there are strategic possibilities between wireless companies, cable players, adjacent industries, Amazon, internet players that should be thought about, because they drive great value for shareholders and also new opportunities for customers. So there definitely are some things that are intuitively obvious."" [Transcript via Seeking Alpha.] Legere specifically pointed to Sprint as having ""an awful lot of scale and a good customer base,"" and to DISH Network as having ""access to good content and spectrum."" DISH, for its part, has been amassing a collection of spectrum that it will have to use by 2020 or face penalties. The company said it's planning to build an Internet of Things network with its spectrum, but it's still in the early planning stage. Since the company's main business of satellite cable is declining, it may be a better option to get acquired. Sprint's parent company recently indicated Sprint is open to a merger with T-Mobile or some other deal with another partner. At the same time, Comcast announced plans to sell its own wireless plans on Verizon's networks, so it's possible those companies may look to merge. That would be a blockbuster, but if AT&T's merger with Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) goes through, why not? Charter Communications is also planning a wireless partnership with Verizon and speculation has swirled about a tie-up. The bigger the deal, the more difficult it would be to get through the FCC, even a business-friendly one. Finally, there are small companies with spectrum assets. Given the recent bidding war for Straight Path Communications, these companies may also be targets going forward. One is Globalstar, and its spectrum that works well with small cells, which helps with densification, or serving places with lots of people. There is also private Ligado Networks, which is building a network geared toward the Industrial Internet of Things for transportation fields. Given Verizon's purchase of Fleetmatics, which provides fleet-management software, in 2016, that may be an interesting combination as well. Much of this is speculation, and investors shouldn't buy a stock just because they think it will get acquired. However, investors interested in the space should watch closely, because whatever happens, the telecom industry is likely to look much different in a few years. ","
      
    Why We Might See a Shakeup in the Telecom Industry Soon -- The Motley Fool

685,Daniel B. Kline,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Things have not gone as planned for Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) since the company acquired Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) for $10.54 billion. In the just-over-a-year since that deal closed, the company has met its cost-savings targets, but it has struggled mightily with revenue and holding onto customers. Those problems have led to a massive decline in the company's share price, which, as you can see on the chart below, has collapsed. None of these problems have discouraged CEO Dan McCarthy, who remains relentlessly optimistic even as his company's picture gets bleaker. It's not that the CEO is delusional, he just strongly believes that despite his company's struggles, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. ""During the quarter, we continued to realize our targeted efficiencies and synergies, and I am also pleased to have achieved our third consecutive quarter of improved FiOS gross additions in the California, Texas and Florida markets,"" he said in the first-quarter earnings release. ""We are executing on a number of initiatives with the goal of enhancing customer experience, reducing churn, stabilizing revenues and generating cash flow."" That's a very rosy read on another quarter where the company lost paying subscribers and saw revenue drop. McCarthy may be able to turn his company around, but there are significant hurdles that could bring Frontier down. Image source: YCharts. McCarthy has done a good job of managing expenses and exploiting the synergies created by the Verizon deal. He has created over $1 billion in annual cost savings, but that number won't mean anything if the company keeps bleeding subscribers. Frontier has lost customer in all four quarters it has owned the CTF properties. McCarthy first blamed that on the switchover from Verizon, then a lack of marketing, and most recently, an effort to clear non-paying customers from the company's books. Those excuses all seem valid, but if the company can't stabilize and then start adding paying customers, the reasons will no longer matter. Frontier bought the CTF properties to give it scale, and so far, that has paid off in operational savings, but continued drops will jeopardize the entire operation. While it has struggled, Frontier has kept shareholders happy by paying a dividend. That isn't going away, but it iss getting a lot worse. The company's board has authorized both a 15 for 1 reverse stock split and a cut in its dividend from $0.105 to $0.04 per share, beginning with the dividend payable on June 30, 2017. That's a sort of double-whammy of bad news that could cause shareholders to say enough is enough. Frontier exists in all of its markets as a secondary choice for customers fed up with the major players in the cable and broadband markets. That could serve the company well as consumers cut the cord with pay television but still need to keep a broadband provider. The risk the company faces in that area is that a number of companies are testing what could be considered national, alternative sources of broadband. There may not be an imminent risk in this area, but any new competition in offering internet service will drive prices down and cost Frontier market share. In addition, while McCarthy's company has a marketing edge in simply not being one of its well-known, little-liked-by-consumers cable/internet/phone giants, it would not have that edge over a technology company. This is sort of a vague threat hanging over every broadband provider, but the creation of a new rival in providing internet service could be a finishing blow for Frontier. ","
      
    3 Things That Could Bring Frontier Communcations Down -- The Motley Fool

686,"Rich Duprey, Tyler Crowe, and Travis Hoium",5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're a dividend investor, by definition, you're looking to earn an income from your stocks today. But equally important, if not more so, is ensuring that the companies you buy will be strong performers tomorrow, too. The goal should be to get paid day in, day out, for the life of your portfolio. So, we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to highlight dividend stocks they believe are not only great investments now thanks to their payouts, but will give income-seeking investors great returns for years to come. Read on to find out why they think Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), and Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (Verizon): A great dividend stock has consistent cash flow from operations and a business with a strong competitive advantage. As a wireless leader in the U.S., Verizon is in a great position on both fronts. The chart below shows Verizon's net income and cash flow from operations over the last five years, and while there's been a decline recently as promotional activity picked up, the company is a cash flow machine. VZ Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts Verizon's advantage has always been its network, which has long been superior to those of competitors like Sprint, T-Mobile, and even AT&T in most of the country. What makes its business great is its continuing investment in new network technology. The next step is the build-out of its 5G network, which it plans to launch on a trial basis this summer. That will make wireless connections available for billions of new connected devices, from cars to wearables. And each one will pay to use the network. Verizon's cash flow and the potential for 5G networks in the future make this a great dividend stock for tomorrow. And with a 5% dividend yield today, it's an stock every investor can get behind. Image source: Sempra Energy. Tyler Crowe (Sempra Energy): The more quarters that go by, the more I think I was initially wrong about Sempra Energy. The electric-and-gas company is looking to become more than just a run of the mill regulated utility that keeps its head down. Instead, it is making massive investments in utilities outside the U.S., as well as branching out into other energy-related businesses such as LNG exports. I had my doubts that the company could pull off the multibillion-dollar expansion it planned without either getting into debt troubles or needing to do some accounting wizardry. Over the past few quarters, though, it has become clear that management timed the execution of these projects well enough that earnings and cash flow growth are keeping pace with their ambitious spending plan. With $900 million in natural gas pipelines coming on line in the second quarter, Sempra will free up lots of cash to plow into its next big venture: The Cameron LNG export terminal. According to management, this project -- along with several other regulated utility upgrades, and a large investment portfolio to expand Mexico's energy infrastructure -- should boost earnings per share by 10% to 11% annually until 2021. Based on that, investors have been told to expect annual dividend raises in the 8% to 9% range over the same time frame. Over the past 10 years, Sempra Energy has more than doubled its dividend -- it yields roughly 3% at the current stock price -- and it looks like there is plenty of growth in the works to keep up that pace for quite some time. I may have been wrong about Sempra in the past, but I'm warming to the idea that this is a utility stock you'll want to own in the future. Image source: Whirlpool. Rich Duprey (Whirlpool): Appliance makers like Whirlpool aren't typically thought of as ""technology companies,"" but as the Internet of Things continues to expand into all facets of our life, even the most mundane of manufacturers will eventually need to embrace the digital age. This maker of ovens, refrigerators, and washing machines is grabbing the future with both hands. Whirlpool is the world's biggest major appliance manufacturer, with approximately $21 billion in annual sales and some of the most recognized brands in the industry, including KitchenAid, Maytag, Amana, Jenn-Air, and, of course, its own name products. In recent periods, it has put an increased emphasis on the connected kitchen and developing the smart appliances of the future that will help ease the tasks of cooks everywhere. Emblematic of that commitment is its recent purchase of personalized digital recipe platform Yummly. While that acquisition isn't material to its business, one thing Whirlpool can get out of the purchase (beyond its 20 million registered users) is an extension  of its appliances' usefulness. Those machines are already connecting with Amazon.com's voice-activated virtual assistant Alexa and its Dash automatic replenishment service; offering scan-to-cook technology that automatically downloads correct cooking instructions to your stove, oven, or microwave when the user scans in a product's UPC code; and giving you the ability to control appliances from anywhere in the house. Whirlpool's stock trades at just 10 times next year's earnings estimate, which analysts' average forecast places at around $17.38 per share, a 15% rise year over year. Its dividend of $4.40 annually currently yields 2.4%. Based on its present strength and its embrace of the future, the appliance maker could be one of the best dividend stocks for tomorrow.

    The 3 Best Dividend Stocks of Tomorrow -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9986
687,Dan Caplinger,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When a stock soars, investors take notice. In those extremely rare cases when a company's share price climbs 400% or more in a single year's time, it points to the sort of extraordinary circumstances that make many wonder if those gains are just the beginning of an even bigger rise. With that in mind, it makes sense to take a closer look at recent multibaggers Straight Path Communications (NYSEMKT:STRP), Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI), and Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL), to try to figure out whether further big gains are likely in their futures. STRP data by YCharts. Straight Path Communications has posted almost exactly a 400% return over the past 12 months. That sharp rise came as a shock to many investors, who had gotten used to the holder of wireless spectrum license assets trading in a relatively sedate manner. That all changed in April, when AT&T (NYSE:T) made a bid to purchase Straight Path in a deal that sent the stock up 150% in a single day. Many believed that AT&T's $96 per share bid would be a fitting end to Straight Path's efforts to divest its spectrum assets. Yet rival Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) came in with an even bigger bid, and after a few rounds of a bidding war, Verizon ended up with the final deal at $184 per share. Investors had briefly hoped that another bid would come in, but AT&T bowed out, which makes it unlikely that Straight Path will see any further gains before its acquisition by Verizon is completed. Image: Straight Path Communications. Elsewhere in the technology world, Applied Optoelectronics provides fiber-optic networking services to the telecommunications industry. Much of the stock's gain of nearly 700% over the past 12 months stemmed from the rise in demand for its services, which have become increasingly relevant as enterprise customers look to implement data centers and other cloud-computing based solutions. Solid performance from the business has built momentum for the stock, and investors now expect a round of upgrades by telecommunications providers could spur dramatic additions in capacity for fiber-optic networks. Most recently, Applied Opto's first-quarter results showed a doubling of data center revenue, and overall gains of 91% on the top line. Strong profits have also helped bolster the stock, and the company's management continues to have upbeat views about its prospects. With implementation of new fiber optic assets likely, Applied Optoelectronics has many investors excited for what could become a long period of strength for its core business. Finally, Tellurian managed to bounce back from adversity, rising almost 650% over the past year. Yet alone among these three stocks, Tellurian hasn't yet recovered all of its lost ground since 2014. Even after its huge gains recently, shares of the liquefied natural gas specialist are down more than 40% over the past three years. The explanation relates to the way in which Tellurian stock became available to the public. Last August, the then-privately held company did a reverse merger with Magellan Petroleum, which was already publicly traded. As a result, it was Magellan's stock-price history that Tellurian had to overcome. With the move, Tellurian shareholders gained exposure to the Driftwood LNG project in Louisiana, and big players in the energy industry have paid attention. In November, General Electric's (NYSE:GE) oil and gas division made a $25 million preferred stock investment in Tellurian, and Total (NYSE:TOT) followed suit in December, spending more than $200 million for an almost one-quarter equity stake in the LNG specialist. Tellurian isn't expecting to start construction of Driftwood until next year, and production there might not start until 2022. But investors think that the project could be extremely profitable, although the speculative nature of the company right now has made Tellurian shares quite volatile. You won't often find stocks that quintuple, but when you do, it's worth taking a closer look. Of the three, Applied Optoelectronics seems to have the clearest prospects for future growth, but the potential rewards from Tellurian are also quite extensive. ","

690,,6012017,Reuters,5252017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc has built a reputation as a scrappy underdog by offering cell service with no contracts and cheap prices. Now it’s aiming for another title: America’s No. 1 wireless carrier. That might seem a stretch for a cell-phone company long known for its lousy coverage outside of major cities. But over the past five years T-Mobile has been on a buying binge to extend its reach. Bankrolled by a $3 billion break-up fee from a failed 2011 merger with AT&T Inc, it has snapped up wireless airwaves in states ranging from New York to Washington. Suddenly, T-Mobile, the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier, is within striking distance of market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T, at least when it comes to delivering nationwide coverage. OpenSignal, a London-based startup that measures network experience based on data from users of its app, said in February that T-Mobile and Verizon were tied in speed rankings in the last quarter of 2016. Testers found a Verizon signal 88 percent of the time; T-Mobile’s network availability was just two percentage points lower. T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray says the bulk of the country will soon have access to its network. “There’s nothing that stands between us delivering and matching, if not beating, Verizon and AT&T’s coverage,” Ray said in an interview with Reuters in May. Verizon and AT&T still maintain a hefty lead when it comes to retail subscribers, each boasting around double T-Mobile’s 55 million users. They also have higher profit margins. Still, T-Mobile’s client base has been growing steadily. Its share of retail subscribers grew to 18 percent in the first quarter of 2017, up from 10 percent in the same period in 2012, according to data from financial services firm Barclays. And when it comes to users who pay a monthly bill, the industry's most valuable customers, T-Mobile has grown that segment for four straight years, while Verizon and AT&T lost monthly subscribers in the first quarter of 2017. T-Mobile’s German majority owner Deutsche Telekom AG, which owns roughly 65 percent of the U.S. carrier, says T-Mobile is now positioned to call its own shots as it plots its course in the United States. “We decide what, when, and how,” Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Tim Hoettges said at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. That includes T-Mobile remaining a stand-alone carrier. But the real intrigue in telecom circles is about a possible merger or acquisition. Rival Sprint Corp , America’s No. 4 carrier, has expressed interest in a tie-up. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Sprint’s controlling shareholder, was prepared to give up control to do a deal with T-Mobile, sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters in February. Cable companies, too, could be interested as they roll out wireless services to bundle more products together. In January, John Malone, whose Liberty Broadband Corp is the largest stakeholder in Charter Communications Inc, raised the possibility that major cable companies could get together and buy T-Mobile. The buzz has boosted T-Mobile’s stock price, which is up nearly 60 percent from a year ago. First-quarter profits hit $698 million, or 80 cents per share, up 46 percent from a year earlier and well ahead of analysts’ expectations. The success of T-Mobile, which has dubbed itself the “Un-carrier,” can be attributed partly to its straight-up approach to mobile. It was the first major carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has continued to badger rivals, most recently with its unlimited data plans. But copious data and fast speeds are pointless if mobile users can’t get a signal. Verizon, the biggest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, says T-Mobile still has a lot of catching up to do. Chief network officer Nicola Palmer pointed to data from testing firm RootMetrics, which has called Verizon the clear U.S. leader in coverage and reliability. Some T-Mobile customers, too, say their service isn’t what it should be. Austin, Texas-resident Abbie Scheider, an avid camper, says she’s out of luck in the woods of central Texas. “I never have service even when others do,” the 24-year-old ad agency account executive said. “It’s frustrating for sure.” T-Mobile’s big push to boost coverage began in 2012 when it received cash plus spectrum from a failed merger with AT&T. The U.S. Justice Department in 2011 sued to block the deal on concerns it would harm competition. Facing the prospect of a lengthy regulatory battle, AT&T walked away. T-Mobile subsequently picked up spectrum from a 2013 merger with Texas-based MetroPCS Communications, followed by a 2014 asset swap with Verizon. Its most ambitious effort yet came in April when it committed $8 billion to become the biggest spender in a U.S. government auction of wireless airwaves. The purchase, which T-Mobile executives refer to as the “mother lode,” will strengthen the company’s presence this year across the western United States, including Arizona, Montana, Texas and Wyoming. And T-Mobile isn’t done yet. Like its competitors, the company is pushing into so-called fifth generation wireless or 5G, a new network that is expected to offer higher speeds and lower response times. While it continues to invest in its network, T-Mobile says it is open to considering various strategic options. Company officials have acknowledged interest in talking with Sprint. At an investor conference in May, T-Mobile Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said Sprint’s spectrum was a “treasure trove that you could do amazing things with.” A Sprint spokeswoman declined to comment. Industry executives and analysts said T-Mobile has shown that it can go it alone, giving it leverage as it enters any discussions. “We want to be a global leader in this space,” Ray said. “That’s the plan and now the capability we have for T-Mobile.” ","

691,,6012017,Reuters,5252017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed China Mobile Limited's (CML) Long-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+'. The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Dominant Mobile Market Position: The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that CML would be able to maintain its dominant position in China's mobile market over the medium term due to its significant economies of scale, robust financial position and solid execution ability. In 2016, CML's mobile service revenue market share remained high at 67%. At end-April 2017, it controlled subscriber share of 64% and 68% for all mobile and 4G services, respectively. The company also utilises its strength in mobile services to develop its broadband business, controlling a subscriber share of 28% at end-April 2017, based on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's data. Government-Directed Tariff Cuts: Further tariff reductions directed by the government may affect CML's revenue and EBITDA growth in 2017. However, we believe that the overall impact should be manageable for CML, as we expect to see continued favourable price elasticity. We believe this round of government-directed tariff cuts is less severe than the previous round in 2015. Chinese operators each pledged to substantially reduce dedicated internet access tariffs for small- and medium-sized enterprises and international long-distance call tariffs, and from 1 October 2017, cease to charge domestic long-distance and roaming fees for their mobile subscribers. Solid Profitability: We expect CML's EBITDA margin to remain solid at around 35%-36%, despite some pressure in 2017 due to utility- and labour-cost inflation and increased competition on 4G from the other two Chinese operators. CML's EBITDA margin rebounded to 36% in 1Q17, from 34% in 4Q16, after higher year-end customer retention and faster phasing-out of domestic long-distance and roaming fees in 2H16. We expect rising data demand, lower handset subsidies and improvement in the tower company's efficiency to help mitigate margin pressure. Declining Capex: CML's pre-dividend FCF margin should expand to over 14% in 2017-2019 as capex decreases. Fitch expects the company to continue to accumulate excess cash despite an increase in dividend payout ratio to 46% from 43%. CML will cut capex in 2017 to CNY176 billion as 4G investment declines. We forecast further capex cuts in 2018 and perhaps 2019. CML may start to spend on 5G capex slightly earlier than the other Chinese operators. However, we believe the majority of China's 5G capex is some years away; investment may start from 2019 at the earliest, but initial 5G spending is likely to be limited. Constrained by Sovereign Ratings: CML's ratings are constrained by China's sovereign rating (A+/Stable) as CML is ultimately controlled by the state. CML's standalone rating is 'AA-'. CML is 73%-owned by China Mobile Communications Corporation, which is 100%-owned by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. DERIVATION SUMMARY CML's standalone rating of 'AA-' remains the highest among all Fitch's telecoms credits, but its rating is constrained by China's sovereign ratings (A+/Stable). CML has significantly stronger market position and more substantial net cash position than its global peers. Its credit profile remains stronger than that of global and local telecoms peers, including China Telecom Corporation Limited (A+/Stable), Singapore Telecommunications Limited (A+/Stable), SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (A-/Stable), Telekom Malaysia Berhad (A-/Stable), Verizon Communications Inc. (A-/Stable) and AT&T Inc. (A-/Rating Watch Negative). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - around mid-single digit revenue growth with rising data revenue offsetting the decline in voice revenue - operating EBITDAR margin at 43%-44% in two to three years - capex of CNY176 billion in 2017 and CNY160 billion-190 billion in 2018-2019 - dividend payout ratio at 46% RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A positive sovereign rating action Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Downgrade of the Standalone Rating to 'A+' - Reversal of its net cash position - Pre-dividend FCF margin falling below 8% on a sustained basis - Operating EBITDAR margin falling below 40% on a sustained basis CML has high rating headroom and Fitch therefore does not envisage a downgrade of the standalone rating to 'A+' from 'AA-' over the medium term. As CML's ratings are constrained by the sovereign's rating, any downgrade of the sovereign will lead to a corresponding downgrade in CML's ratings. LIQUIDITY Abundant Liquidity: At end-December 2016, CML's unrestricted cash balance of CNY426 billion far exceeded its interest-bearing borrowing of CNY5 billion. CML has no maturities due before October 2017. Debt Structure: Its debt totalled CNY5 billion at end-2016 (end-2015: CNY5bn), which consisted of the unsecured long-term bonds guaranteed by China Mobile Communications Corporation due in 2017.

692,Michael J. Kramer,6012017,Investopedia,5252017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A hotly debated topic among tech dealmakers has been how much Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO ) assets are worth. The new holding company for Yahoo will have its work cut for it after the company sells its search and other assets for an estimated $4.5 billion to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). If that deal is completed this month, Yahoo will shed its name and the holding company will be called Altaba Inc. How do you pronounce that new name? Al-ta-ba or Al-taba? That's a mouthful. No matter how you pronounce it, Altaba will operate as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The question every investor should ask themselves is this. Will the old Yahoo - under a new name - be good at managing the assets? YHOO Market Cap data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported an investment in Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) of $41.3 billion and an ownership interest in Yahoo Japan of $9.3 billion.  Yahoo beneficially owns 15.4 percent of Alibaba, representing 383.5 billion ordinary shares. Alibaba has a market cap as of June 1 of $310.99 billion, which would mean that Yahoo's current stake in Alibaba is roughly $47.89 billion. Yahoo Japan has a market cap of roughly $25.4 billion. Yahoo owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, representing a current market value of around $9.02 billion. YHOO Long Term Deferred Tax Liabilities (Quarterly) data by YCharts It seems like a no brainer right? Yahoo's current market cap - before the Verizon deal -  is $48.10 billion, and its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is worth $56.91 billion. So Yahoo currently trades for less than the market value of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Then throw in that Yahoo shows cash and short-term marketable securities of $6.91 billion, then add the sale from Verizon of roughly $4.5 billion, it bring Yahoo's cash value to $11.41 billion. That takes the valuation for Yahoo up to $68.32 billion. YHOO Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported deferred tax liabilities for its Alibaba investment of $16.7 billion; this represents nearly 40 percent of the value of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba of $41.3 billion. As of December 31, Yahoo reported deferred tax liabilities of $13.6 billion, while its investment stake was $33.6 billion, representing 40 percent of the value of the stake. With a $48.10 billion valuation on its Alibaba stake, its tax deferred liability, using the same 40 percent, would be $19.46 billion. The company lists other long-term tax liabilities at $519.95 million. Also, the company recently announced a stock buy-back program of $3 billion. So based on these liabilities, how much is Yahoo worth then? It may be less than the current valuation the market is assigning to it. There's a big ""IF"" in all of this. First, can Yahoo figure out how to avoid the tax bill from its Alibaba stake?

Many retirees are attracted to large-cap dividend stocks for their hefty yields, and because their size and name recognition give many an impression of safety. If only investing were so easy. Last week, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) shed almost 8% after earnings, joining IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) as significant laggards in an otherwise strong earnings season. These companies have the same basic problem: They have traditionally been able to charge exceptionally high prices for their products and services, but customers are becoming savvier, especially in tech, and smaller competitors are offering solutions rivaling the quality of ""price leaders"" -- at much lower price points. In response, all three companies are investing in next-generation technologies and acquiring smaller businesses to reposition themselves for the future. Let's examine each in greater detail. Source image: Getty Images. Cisco has long dominated enterprise hardware. While the company has acquired its way into greater diversification, it still makes 45% of its revenue from its core switching and routing hardware. These segments are currently under attack due to the rise of software-defined networking. Rival vendor Arista Networks has come out with its own switches geared for the data center. Its powerful EOS software allows the company to use the latest, most cost-effective hardware components to run its switches. In contrast, Cisco has long used custom chips developed in-house to run its switches, which is more expensive. Cisco has even reportedly contemplated selling its switching software separately in order to compete on ""whitebox"" solutions, as its data center segment fell 5% last quarter. Cisco also faces pressure on its wireless segment, which contributed 5% of revenue in 2016. Low-cost vendor Ubiquiti Networks is rolling out its Unifi Elite service this quarter, aiming to poach Cisco's enterprise-class clients with lower-cost offerings. Any loss of share there could also put pressure on Cisco's enterprise switching as well. While Cisco is touting growth in software, security, and services, its forecast of 4%-6% revenue declines reveals increased pressure in its core. IBM has long talked up its ability to run mission-critical functions for the largest organizations. The company makes mainframes, where sensitive company data and records are stored, and its consulting wing was the go-to for any advanced IT project. The rise of cloud computing and software-defined systems, however, posed a threat to IBM's core mainframe, consulting, and integration businesses. A turning point came in 2014, when IBM lost a huge contract with the Central Intelligence Agency, which switched to Amazon's cloud services in order to foster open collaboration between agencies and save money at the same time. The contract proved ultra-high-security entities could move to the cloud and away from locked-in data centers run by companies like IBM. IBM countered the loss with the acquisition of cloud-storage provider SoftLayer, and has been vigorously attempting to become a force in cloud ever since. In the most recent quarter, IBM marked impressive cloud growth of 35% year over year. The problem is, total revenue from its technology services and cloud platforms segment declined 2% and gross profit margin declined 200 basis points. That means either IBM is merely converting existing on-premise customers to its cloud, or it's losing more legacy customers than it's gaining new ones. IBM has spent years developing Watson, its cognitive artificial intelligence product, and its cognitive computing software segment grew 5% in the first quarter. Still, that only made up roughly 20% of revenues. With most other segments declining, the company will have to grow its new initiatives faster than it currently is able to. Verizon is slightly different from Cisco or IBM, but has long benefited from the same advantage -- having the highest-quality, most advanced solution, which allowed the company to price its offerings expensively. The problem for Verizon is that lower-cost wireless companies T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint have networks that are getting closer to Verizon's. Sprint is running ads with Verizon's old pitchman, taunting that its network quality was within 1% of Verizon's. Meanwhile, T-Mobile has been acquiring spectrum while forcing Verizon to go with an unlimited data plan, which has apparently also slowed down Verizon's leading network. In response, Verizon is acquiring digital-media businesses such as AOL and Yahoo!, telematics businesses like Fleetmatics, and next-generation 5G infrastructure with XO Communications for fiber, and Straight Path Communications for millimeter-wave spectrum. However, the segment, which includes digital media and telematics, generated only 5% total revenue last quarter. Meanwhile, the wireless segment, which makes up over half of Verizon's revenue, declined 5.2%. Investors in these companies likely own them for safety and yield, but none are buy-and-forget companies right now. It's possible today's growth seeds will become big moneymakers in the future, but investors won't know that for years. Meanwhile, it's possible these companies are facing a long, secular decline. Investors should be aware of both possibilities and tread carefully. ","

697,Daniel B. Kline,6012017,Fool,5252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Proprietary content can keep customers loyal. That's the logic behind Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ill-fated go90 platform. The problem, and it's a big one, is that creating content people actually want presents major challenges. In addition, go90 launched at a time when consumers have an unprecedented amount of content to choose from. Verizon, which spent $200 million on content for the service and another $80 million marketing it in 2016, according to Business Insider, also made the mistake of entering a market already owned by YouTube. go90 was an attempt to lure millennials, a generation particularly resistant to craven marketing efforts. It was an attempt that was badly off base and failed quickly. go90 still exists, but it has been dramatically scaled back, with 155 full-time staff losing their jobs in January, Deadline reported. Verizon hoped to lure young people in with go90. Image source: Getty Images. When it blows hundreds of millions of dollars on an idea that never had any hopes of working, a company like Verizon won't admit it made a mistake. Instead, it releases a statement like this one: Our focus with go90 and our Verizon digital media efforts are to fulfill our strategy of leveraging Verizon content investments, enhancing user experience, and strengthening our advertising infrastructure. Fulfilling this strategy has resulted in some duplicative resources and has required organizational changes impacting 155 employees as we consolidate offices in Los Angeles, San Jose, and New York. That's a whole lot of corporate gobbledygook to avoid saying what a terrible idea spending so much trying to create viral videos was. Of course, shareholders and the 155 who lost their job were probably delighted to hear that ""these changes are not indicative to a change in our strategy."" The biggest mistake Verizon made with go90 was attempting to launch it based on spending big. It would have made more sense to take a slower, more grassroots approach. That's how Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Hulu, and Amazon.com entered the content game. Verizon instead had the hubris to assume that it could throw money at the problem and millennials would be easy to lure in. That would seem to be the case given the enormous volume of highly watched yet awful content on YouTube, but that platform had the advantage of being first. At best, go90 was a me-too player in an already crowded field, and in reality it was never really a player at all. In addition, breaking into episodic programming and viral videos requires both talent and luck. All of the aforementioned platforms, as well as the broadcast networks and cable channels that produce original content, sometimes fail with shows that deserve an audience. There was no reason to believe that Verizon -- even a deep-pocketed Verizon -- would have quick and easy success in the content space. It's easy to see why Verizon wants to have a draw beyond a high-priced wireless service. The advantage its network once had over lower-cost rivals Sprint and T-Mobile has shrunk, taking away what has been its key marketing pitch. Owning content that people want to watch would be that draw. The problem is that creating content that keeps people paying for a service that costs more than its rivals isn't easy. HBO, Netflix, and very few others have been able to achieve that. Maybe in time go90 would have gotten there, but it doesn't seem likely. ","

698,"Travis Hoium, Timothy Green, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",6012017,Fool,5252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Long-term investing is often talked about in terms of a few years in today's stock market. But at The Motley Fool, we love to find stocks we can hold for decades and make money on over the very, very long term. We asked three of our contributors which stocks they want to own for the next 50 years, and SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) made the top of their lists. Reuben Gregg Brewer (SYSCO Corporation): SYSCO Corporation is the largest food distributor in the United States, serving restaurants, schools, and hospitals, among other customers. It also operates in Canada and Mexico, and recently bought a large European food distributor to expand its reach into a new market. Food distribution is a highly fragmented industry with ample opportunity for SYSCO to do ""bolt-on"" deals, which have been its bread and butter for decades. The company has faced two notable problems, lately. The first was a failed attempt to buy US Foods, one of SYSCO's largest U.S. competitors. The hope was to achieve cost savings through that deal that would improve SYSCO's margins, which had been falling since 2010. Weak margins in an already low-margin business is the second big problem. With the deal scuttled, however, SYSCO has renewed its focus on improving its own operations. And that's led to a notable operating-margin improvement over the last year. SYY Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. SYSCO is clearly aware of the problem, is dealing with it, and achieving success. That's actually not so surprising from a company that's increased its dividend for 47 years and counting. The dividend-growth rate has slowed to about the rate of inflation over the last few years, but over the past decade, the annualized growth rate has been roughly twice that level. With a solid 2.5% yield, as well as a long history of successfully expanding via acquisition in a fragmented industry and rewarding investors along the way, SYSCO is the type of company you can own for a very long time. Tim Green (McDonald's): Restaurants, perhaps more than any other type of business, come and go. The industry is brutal, with no barrier to entry driving intense and unending competition. But McDonald's is no ordinary restaurant. The company has been around for decades, and its business model of having most of its restaurants run by franchisees is wildly profitable. McDonald's earned $4.7 billion of net income last year on $24.6 billion of revenue. Image source: McDonald's. In order to thrive for another 50 years, McDonald's will need to change with the times. McDonald's now offers delivery through the UberEATS service in some cities, and it plans to roll out mobile ordering and pickup to all of its U.S. restaurants by the end of the year. McDonald's is a laggard when it comes to digital strategy, but it's aiming to catch up quickly. If I had to bet on any restaurant chain being around in 50 years, it would be McDonald's. The company is nearly recession-proof, with its focus on low prices driving sales in even the worst of times. Revenue dipped slightly in 2009 during the financial crisis, but it quickly recovered, and the bottom line was completely unaffected. McDonald's has thrived during its first 50 years, and it will likely do the same for decades to come. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Besides food and housing, I think one thing that will be similar 50 years from now as it is today is data flowing through the air wirelessly, and then being disseminated to other people or things. Maybe it'll be phone calls, or maybe it'll be data from self-driving cars, or maybe personal drones will need to communicate with central command wirelessly. Whatever it is, I think Verizon is well positioned to be at the center of that wireless-communications future. You can see below that Verizon is essentially tied with AT&T as the most profitable U.S. telecommunications company. This gives Verizon a powerful position in a market with very few players and the cash flow needed to upgrade its network, when necessary. VZ Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the next few years, we'll see Verizon's strong position playing out as it rolls out a 5G network, starting with an 11-city pilot by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Sprint and T-Mobile don't plan on rolling out 5G until 2019. As more devices become connected and the Internet of Things grows, Verizon's network will become more and more valuable. Fifty years from now, this still will be a company that will likely be making tons of money for investors. And getting a 5% dividend yield in the meantime is a nice way to generate cash from a great long-term investment. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years -- The Motley Fool

699,Travis Hoium,6012017,Fool,5252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sprint (NYSE:S) are two of the biggest mobile network operators in the U.S., but they are very different companies for investors. Sprint is the low-cost provider trying to disrupt the market, while AT&T is the decades-old behemoth that's now expanding into mobile television. Which stock is the better buy for investors today? Here's a look at how they stack up against each other. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has one of the biggest and best wireless networks in the U.S., rivaled only by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in scale and quality. Sprint's network isn't quite as good, which everyone knows and forces Sprint to compete mostly on price. If it can't offer customers lower prices than AT&T or Verizon, it simply can't compete. Being the cost leader may not necessarily be a problem if it weren't for the fact that wireless companies leverage their scale to make money and have to constantly invest billions of dollars into network upgrades. And if you have lower margins than your competitors, you also have less money for upgrades. That brings us to the difference in these two companies' scale. The chart below does a good job of showing the difference between Sprint's and AT&T's pricing power and their total assets. AT&T's sheer scale shows how much it's invested in its network advantage and the higher margin is the result. T Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Sprint has chipped away at some of that advantage as 4G wireless networks have aged and the difference between networks has subsided. But that gap is about to open again. Where Sprint will have real difficulty competing is when 5G networks start to launch later this year. AT&T has said it will have 5G in at least 20 metro areas by the end of 2017, and Sprint doesn't have plans to enter the 5G market until at least late 2019. That will give AT&T a huge head start in signing up high-end customers willing to pay a premium for 5G speeds. Then there's the DirecTV acquisition by AT&T that allows it to offer a more complete wireless and digital service across the country. It can now bundle services together like cable companies did with TV, internet, and phone. Except this time around, all of those services will be wireless. In telecommunications, AT&T is just a better company today. Its roomier balance sheet is a big advantage, as shown by much higher margins. And it's investing more in future technologies than Sprint has the ability to do. To top it off, the stock's dividend yields 5.1%, a nice payout for owning a company built to last in a world going more mobile every day. ","
      
    Better Buy: AT&T, Inc. vs. Sprint -- The Motley Fool

700,Brian Stoffel,6012017,Fool,5252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. As our lifespans increase in the 21st century, our nest eggs need to provide for a longer time frame. This is a good problem to have, but it does present unique challenges. Image source: Getty Images. Retirements often last over two decades. Remembering that, here are the two big reasons I believe retirees should look elsewhere for their dividends. One of the things I look for in an investment is redundancy. That means when shocks hit the company, it can emerge stronger than it was before. There are two key metrics to measure redundancy: On both fronts, American Tower falls short. Currently, the company has $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, but over $17 billion in debt. That means in times of stress, its highly levered balance sheet would be a liability. But it's customer concentration risk that really concerns me. American Tower relied upon AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile for 21%, 15%, 11%, and 9% of their sales in 2016, respectively. And if we look at the trends, this has been the case for a while. American Tower's Reliance on the ""Big Four""Create column charts Think about it: All it would take is one decision by one committee -- or even one person -- at one of these companies to drastically affect both American Tower's business, and its stock price. Sudden downward swings in prices are not a retiree's friend. Of course, you could rightfully argue that American Tower is without substantial peer, that these companies would be foolhardy to abandon American Tower, and its moat is wider than I'm letting on. Many of the contracts in place, after all, are long term in nature. To that, I would say two things. First, consolidation in the industry is a bad thing for American Tower, but there are hints that it might already be happening. When one more customer is eliminated, the amount paid to American Tower will surely drop. Second, there are plausible scenarios that could make American Tower obsolete over the next two decades. While several technology companies have experimented, for instance, with beaming down Internet connectivity from unmanned solar drones, who's to say the same couldn't eventually be done for wireless telephony? The possibility for a leap-frogging technology could undermine American Tower's expansion abroad -- particularly in Brazil and India. To get my gist, imagine the possibilities that PC makers imagined for international expansion back in the early 2000s. But then, they were leap-frogged by smartphones. Today, virtually all Internet users coming online in emerging economies do so from mobile devices. The fact of the matter is that American Tower is relying upon the status quo -- in terms of wireless connectivity -- to remain exactly the same. And in today's communications field, that's not a great stance to have. The company's mission is ""to make wireless communication possible anywhere."" That's actually a great mission statement, but the company's business is almost entirely dependent upon land-based towers to transmit signals. Such an approach doesn't lend itself to flexibility, adaptability, or the possibility of ""multiple futures"" in the face changing industry dynamics. When you're counting on your nest egg to continue providing for you until -- at least -- 2037, I think there are better dividend-paying bets for your retirement dollars. ","
      
    1 Terrible Stock for Retirees -- The Motley Fool

  ",-0.9839
701,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",6012017,Fool,5252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock ""somewhat downward."" However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has ""stickiness,"" meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $5 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. Apple's iPhone, which heralded the age of touchscreen smartphones and app ecosystems, was one of the most successful tech products of the past decade. But for every hit product that reshapes the market, there are countless flops that became cautionary tales. Let's look back at ten of the biggest technological duds of the past decade. Image source: Getty Images. Back in late 2002, Toshiba and NEC developed the HD DVD as the high-capacity successor to DVDs. But at the same time, Sony was developing the competing Blu-Ray format in partnership with eight other leading electronics companies. Sony -- which had its own movie studio and extensive media partnerships -- also convinced other major studios to launch their films in the Blu-Ray format. The disc war was over by 2008, and companies withdrew their support for HD DVDs. By the end, Toshiba had sunk over $1 billion into the doomed technology. Image source: Google. Image source: Microsoft. In late 2001, Apple changed digital music forever with the launch of the iPod. Microsoft launched its rival, the Zune, five years later. Despite positive reviews, the Zune flopped due to its delayed entry, weak marketing efforts, and lack of support among major record labels. Sales never picked up, but Microsoft kept the Zune alive for six more generations before killing it off in 2012. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft launched Windows Phone 7, its first multi-touch mobile operating system, in 2010 -- three years after the first iPhone arrived and two years after the first Android devices launched. That delay was costly, since most developers and consumers were already tethered to the iOS and Android ecosystems. In a desperate bid to expand Windows Phone, Microsoft acquired Nokia's handset unit in 2014 -- which resulted in billions of dollars in writedowns a year later. Today, Windows Phone accounts for less than 1% of the smartphone market. Image source: BlackBerry. After the iPhone arrived, smartphone market leader BlackBerry dismissed the idea of touchscreen phones, claiming that enterprise users would always want keyboards. When enterprise users started buying iPhones, BlackBerry tried straddling touchscreens and keyboards with the Storm, a bizarre touchscreen phone which had a ""clickable"" screen that simulated the physical response of a keyboard. Yet that odd mechanism frequently failed, and Verizon reportedly replaced most of the 1 million Storms which it sold in 2008, resulting in nearly $500 million in losses. BlackBerry's market share continued plunging afterwards, and it finally stopped making its own phones last year. Image source: HP. HP launched the Touchpad in July 2011 as a potential competitor to Apple's iPad. But just a month later, HP announced that it would discontinue all devices running webOS -- including the Touchpad -- to pivot away from the competitive mobile market. The remaining Touchpad inventory was subsequently liquidated for $99 per unit -- making it one of the shortest-lived tablets in history. Image source: Facebook. In 2013, Facebook tried to take over Android devices with Facebook Home, a replacement launcher that let users quickly view and post content on Facebook, message other users, and launch apps. The lock screen also displayed notifications from Facebook and other apps. Facebook Home was a clear attempt to take over a mobile OS without actually creating one -- but the app was skewered by poor reviews (generally complaining about the pushy and overbearing nature of the app) and privacy concerns. That flop caused Facebook to go back to the drawing board and make Messenger a platform instead. Image source: Google. Google initially launched Glass via a limited ""Explorer"" program in 2013, then offered the augmented-reality device to the public the following year. Its initial price of $1,500 was steep, but Google intended to lower it for a commercial launch. Many tech enthusiasts hailed Glass as the next big computing platform, but Google didn't consider the privacy implications of putting cameras on users' faces. Businesses banned Glass from their establishments, while mainstream consumers disliked the device's awkward appearance and high price tag. Google discontinued Glass in 2015 but promised to launch a next-gen version in the near future. Image source: Amazon. In 2014, Amazon believed that its success with the prisoner-taking Kindle Fire tablets could be replicated with the Fire Phone. However, the mid-range hardware failed to impress customers who were already using iPhones and Android devices. Amazon slashed the price of the Fire Phone from $199 to $0.99 (with a two-year contract) within the first month, took a $170 million writedown on unsold phones later that year, then killed off the device in 2015. Image source: Samsung. Last year, Samsung's well-received Note 7 smartphones started exploding due to faulty batteries. The ensuing debacle resulted in millions of units being recalled and the cancellation of the flagship device -- which resulted in a $2.3 billion writedown during Samsung's third quarter and plenty of lost revenue during the holiday season. Despite that big setback, initial demand for Samsung's new Galaxy S8 devices appears to be robust -- indicating that the brand wasn't tarnished by the scandal. ","

Kline,6012017,Fool,5252017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A full transcript follows the video. Daniel Kline: We're coming to you from the past, but talking about the future, so it's very confusing. Shen: You had some issues getting to Fool HQ this time around. Kline: I was three miles from the airport, about 45 minutes from my house, when my low-pressure light comes on. Being the responsible fellow I am, I decide I'll pull over to the righthand lane. Boom, my right front tire blows up. I have no idea what happened. Fortunately, AAA said they would be there in 45 minutes. Two hours and 45 minutes later, they showed up. I missed my flight, I had to fly to a different airport, but I did eventually get here, all for you. Shen: Dan, I was giving you an opportunity to say that you rolled up your sleeves yourself, jacked the car up, changed the tire. Kline: Here's the sad thing. One, I couldn't have done that, because I was on a highway with absolutely no room. But I could have been in a parking lot, and I still couldn't have done that. The guy from AAA asked me, ""Do you have a spare?"" I was like, ""I don't know?"" I said, ""I have a trunk? There's a possibility."" Shen: Regardless, I'm glad that you can make it. It's always really nice to have you in studio. Fools, our focus for this episode will be technology in the restaurant sector. Before we get into that, Dan, you cover a ton of wireless companies and cable companies, too. You cover them quite extensively. Last week, I spoke with Asit a little bit about the partnership that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) entered with Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) to unite their very significant resources, as they get into the wireless business. Xfinity Mobile from Comcast is expected to hit the market soon. What are your thoughts? Kline: I think it's a major uphill battle. On paper, it makes sense. Just like when any of those companies, any of the cable companies, decide to sell home alarms, there's a logic of, they have the customer base, they already have an install force. But it never works that well, because the reality is, all Americans that want mobile phones have mobile phones. And while there is some churn, the four major wireless carriers are really well setup to bring your number over, to bribe you to make the change. So just because you're going to pay a little less, you're going to get $5 or $10 back in credit, whatever it works out being with the bundling, I just don't see too many people. And while not all the details are out, these systems tend to be limited, where it's just the iPhone. I think in this case, it is just the iPhone so far. And consumers are used to choices. So I don't think it's necessarily going to be a failure in terms of, will it add some bottom line for these companies for relatively little effort on their part. But I don't think this becomes the fifth wireless carrier that gets up to, T-Mobile is in 70-something million homes, I'm guessing at that number, but T-Mobile plus Sprint is right around where AT&T and Verizon are. I don't think it becomes even a blip on that. It'll be a few million people if they're lucky. Shen: Sure. As far as I know, from what I could find out about the offering, iPhone is definitely the focus, but they mentioned a few other flagship devices will be available from competing handset makers like Samsung. But, don't you feel like, in terms of sheer resources, if there's any company that's going to try and get into the very competitive wireless space, Comcast is in a position where they can throw their weight around. Kline: I think they should buy Sprint. If you want to get into this space and you're Comcast, just get into this space. Then make a Sprint movie and have a Sprint ride at Universal Studios, have the can you hear me now guy, where he says now I'm talking, or whatever it is, have him in a TV series on NBC. I don't really get this playing around the edges. Cablevision did this. When Cablevision did it, it was much more based on wifi and being as cheap as possible in terms of using the airwaves, which is part of what Comcast and Charter are doing but only part of it. And it was very incremental. It was for parents who wanted a third phone for their child but didn't necessarily want to spend the real money. It's very hard to make people switch from something that works. I have T-Mobile, I'm not sure what you have. Shen: I have Straight Talk, which is essentially AT&T, similar service to this, in a way, piggybacking off of a major carrier. Kline: Right. I know that I get better offers. Sprint and T-Mobile are perpetually battling each other. If I'm happy, I'm not going to change. You have to mail your phones back and go to a store and fill out paperwork, it's not simple, and I'm not going to deal with it just to give Charter more money. Charter is still one of the least liked companies out there. I don't think people are clamoring to do more business -- Shen: Along with Comcast, no less. Kline: Yeah, I don't think people are going, ""Oh, I really want to give these guys a bigger chunk of my business!"" Shen: OK. Well, I wanted to get your first impressions on this. Once it launches and we have more information, maybe some first-hand experience from subscribers, we'll talk about it more, see if it's having any impact for the business -- Kline: Yeah, we'll test it. My mom lives in a Comcast van at home, so we'll try to get a phone and see what it looks like. Shen: There you go. Moving on to our main topic, we have restaurants. Specifically within this space, the role of technology. For any Fools who have been following this sector, you've seen in headlines recently that restaurants have struggled with some low traffic, declining same-store sales from a period of overexpansion, but I was thinking about this in relation to these other industries that I've talked about today, with you and earlier in the studio with Adam, the fact that department stores, on the one hand, and cable companies, they face some existential threats. You have e-commerce on one hand, you have various streaming internet alternatives on the other for cable companies. I think the restaurant industry is interesting because fast-casual might take share from quick service, the broad industry might see weakness due to excessive expansion, like in this case. But in the end, people have to eat, they love eating out. And as a result, I think execution becomes a really clear differentiator between different chains, and there's not as much of an industry boogeyman that you can pin your problems to. But on the flip side, you have the success stories, and some of the big trends I get excited for the restaurant industry include loyalty programs, restaurants trying to source ingredients locally, and also, there's technology. That's where we will focus. I think previously, we spoke about how robots, for example, eliminate the need for human employees all together. But a lot of the technology initiatives that we'll talk about today seem to be previews of how that might work. Kline: I think if you look at some of the technology we're talking about, what you're really focusing on is, restaurant sales overall are down a little bit, 1% or 2%. It's not anywhere near the retail drop. So you're looking here and saying, I'm Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), or McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), or whatever the chain is -- how do I maximize my business? What's worked, and it's worked for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Panera, and we've talked about this before, is mobile ordering. I think mobile ordering at Chipotle makes a ton of sense and will be a game changer. When I say game changer, I mean a 2% to 3% net sales gain. It's not suddenly going to explode their business. But if you walk into a Chipotle -- and we've both done this -- and there's 10 people in line ahead of you, you might leave, because it's slow. So what a lot of Chipotles have done is set up a second production line in the store, and if you order from the app, your food will be ready when you get there. And they're having all the same execution problems Starbucks had. The people at the front don't know where the order is, have you paid, how do you handle it, do you pick it up. But all that will get sorted out, that's just growing pains and retail training, which is not an easy thing to do. So I think at your higher-end places like Chipotle that have lines, that's actually going to allow them to serve more customers during peak hours. At a place like McDonald's, I think ultimately, there's a gain in taking workers out of the equation. But in the short-term, maybe there's some drive-thru benefit to being able to order and pick up, not going through the line. But in a McDonald's, I don't see as big a benefit when most things are not made to order, and it's sort of a production line, of even if you want a pretty special order, it's coming out quickly. So there's not really a major need to cut that. So McDonald's will gain eventually from technology, but in the short-term, I think you're going to see some of your higher-volume fast casual places like Chipotle, as you've seen with Panera, really benefit from this technology. Shen: Yeah. And we're definitely still, I think, in the early stages of the launch and the testing phases for a lot of the companies that are dipping toes into this. There are companies like Domino's (NYSE:DPZ), which are turning this into an art for themselves, and really juicing their quarterly results, seeing tons of growth with the technology and how they implemented it really well. With Chipotle, you mentioned the second make line, I think they call it, they're calling it ""smarter pickup times"". They've been able to quantify some of the benefits in that this better management of their digital orders, they give them more accurate estimates of when orders will be ready. In some of their testing, they mentioned that digital order wait times decreased as much as 50%. Restaurant staff have better tools to essentially manage this channel, like you mentioned, during peak business times. If they have a bottleneck, in terms of those peak hours and how many people they can serve, this can alleviate some of that, then that does flow through to their top and bottom line. Kline: And there's a major customer service benefit. If you call Domino's -- back in the old days when you called Domino's. I'm sure your generation now is Snapchatting Domino's and then paying via Venmo. Shen: Exactly. Kline: But back when you used to call Domino's, if they told you your pizza was going to be an hour, you went, ""OK, my pizza will be an hour."" If in an hour, your pizza showed up, you were satisfied. So I was talking with you earlier. I use the Pei Wei app. The Pei Wei app is pretty innovative in that you can completely customize any order. If you want sweet and sour chicken with no sweet and sour sauce, hold the chicken, you can do that. And you can put in what time you want to pick it up. I was picking up, it was maybe 5:20, so I put in 5:40, that was the distance from my house. And the app came back and said, ""Your time has been adjusted to 5:50."" And I went, OK, no problem, I'll leave 10 minutes later versus if I had been at the store, waited in line, placed my order, I would have been there for 30 minutes. So it was an absolute benefit of my time, better customer service, and it will make me much more likely to go back. And I think that's where you're starting to see some of the value in these. Pei Wei is a higher end fast casual concept that can take quite a while in a line. Shen: So we've talked so far about Chipotle, Pei Wei, in your experience. I think those are places where the food quality may be up a tier, they're bringing in plenty of customers in that regard. Going to the more fast casual side, where a company like McDonald's -- Kline: The more fast food side. Shen: Yeah, the fast food side. Bringing out their ""Experience of the Future"", they're dubbing it, testing with kiosks for ordering, technology that allows their employees to bring food to your tableside. McDonald's management has cited that 500 million orders were lost to their direct fast food competitors in the past few years, due to their issues they faced. The thing with McDonald's is, they saw quite a nice bump, at least relative to their more stable industry in their business, due to all day breakfast. That has essentially dissipated. Do you think that technology in this regard can help them overcome some concerns that there always are, in terms of food quality? Kline: It's eventually going to help them overcome some costs. That, we've covered. In the short term, we've talked about this personally but I'm not sure if we've talked about it on the show, if I walk into McDonald's and I want a Big Mac with no special sauce, with an extra slice of cheese, with four pickles, not three, and I try to tell that to the human being behind the counter, who may be a college kid, may be a go-getter, super smart, they've been working at McDonald's for seven hours at that point, they don't care that I want four pickles. So if that goes into a kiosk, not only is there a much easier ability for the person -- eventually robot -- making that hamburger to get it right, and a record for if they don't get it right, for me to hand them a receipt, to say, ""This wasn't supposed to have ketchup."" So I think you're going to see a subtle but important improvement, especially on drive-thru where there is nothing worse than, you order your 10-piece McNuggets, your large fries, and you get home with your drive-thru back and open it up and it's someone else's Big Mac that you don't want. So I think this is going to eliminate a lot of that pain point, and that will absolutely have an impact on the bottom line, but it's not as direct as, ""Boy, the line is long, now I can serve twice as many people."" Shen: Yeah. I will add, in addition to McDonald's, Wendy's announced earlier this year that they would install kiosks at about 1,000 of their locations by the end of this year. They've cited similar things that we've talked about, reducing labor costs, for example. But on the Panera side, Panera 2.0, some things management has said that I think make it really interesting, in terms of the lift in ticket size that you can get from these kiosks, there is a quote from, I don't know if it was somebody in their management, but I found this quote that basically said, ""People who order at a kiosk will generally spend about twice as long ordering with that kiosk than they do if they're speaking directly to a cashier."" What that ultimately means or leads to is more opportunities for upselling -- every time you place an order for a salad, do you want to pair that with a soup? You order a coffee, do you want to pair that with a donut? Then, they're able to customize their orders, and ultimately get larger tickets. Domino's has spoken to this as well with their apps. People upsell themselves. When they're ordering a pizza, they add things to it that they wouldn't otherwise if ordering by the phone. Kline: And it takes away shame. If I'm at Starbucks, and there's a person, I'm going to buy black coffee, room for cream. If I'm ordering on my own, I'm like, ""I'll have a Unicorn Frappuccino with extra chocolate chips, could you grind up a pie in that?"" So, I think there's a level where, if I'm ordering Domino's and I'm a person talking to a person, I might be like, ""I'll have a medium pizza with pepperoni, please."" If I'm on my own, bacon, pepperoni, sausage, and put another pizza on top of it. So you get into some impulse control issues. And I think there might be some technology ability going forward to manage calories and things like that, in a way that you'll still spend, but maybe not make the stupid decisions I just described. But, yeah, absolutely, if you don't have to interact with another human being, you're going to order more. You might get that soda you'd be embarrassed to buy from a person, or the dessert, or whatever it is. Shen: I think trying to quantify some of these things, some of the benefits we see, beyond the labor cost, the large ticket sizes, the fact that people order more, and the fact that if you order exactly what you want and you're not worried about it because you're on a kiosk, you're not worried about telling the cashier about all the different customizations that you want to make, you'll enjoy the food more. And maybe that leads to better loyalty to that chain, or whatever it is. Kline: It's also about removing uncomfortableness. We've talked a lot about this, we both like all sorts of different ethnic food. If I'm an American and I've never had Thai or Korean or Japanese or whatever, and I walk in and it says, whatever the local name is, it says Pad See Ew, and I'm like, ""I don't know what that is. Is that chicken? Is that noodles?"" If it says Pad See Ew, they're noodles with this and that and that. Or, an empanada, here's what an empanada is, and it lays it out. Shen: Or, if it's spicy, and you worried about that -- Kline: Right, where you want to remove the spice, or allergen concerns, or whatever it is, the more of that you can make not embarrassing -- as someone who has a food allergy, I hate walking into a restaurant, and I have cousins who have very serious peanut allergies, so you have to make a big deal out of it. If that could just be something that I could automate and still know they were going to be safe and things were going to be done, it would make times I cook at home times I go out to restaurants. Shen: Sure. So we have these kiosks, and we have, even beyond the mobile ordering, which obviously, hopefully, can help some of these restaurants during the peak hours speed customers through, increase their volume. The idea of some of these tablets that restaurants are also outfitting some of their tables with. This is more of a sit-down experience. Shen: And a lot of restaurants that have outfitted their tables with these tablets have found that people are more likely to order the ancillary items, higher instances of customers ordering dessert, coffee, other drinks. Those are all nice margin boosters for those businesses. Kline: There's a window. If you're a restaurant, there's a period between the end of dinner and the feeling of fullness when people will buy dessert. They often regret desert by the time it shows up. That's why most restaurants have a to-go container for desserts you shouldn't have ordered. But if the waitress is too busy or misses that window, or I would have had another beer if she got to me 10 minutes into my meal, but at 20 minutes into the meal I'm like, ""Oh, I'm driving too soon,"" or, ""Maybe I don't need to spend this money."" So there's an amazing ability to give me every impulse if I'm sitting there and finish my gin and tonic and want another one, I just hit the button and there it comes whereas if I had that extra five minutes of reflection, maybe I would go, this is a bad idea. Shen: An overarching theme, in terms of some of the technology we've had, eliminating the need for an employee, or someone to actually be the cashier, to be the server, also maybe minimizing some of the inconsistency that you can get in terms of the service experience. I want to end the show, though, on a bit of irony. You brought this up before we filmed, and I thought it was really interesting. Some reports that we have from insiders in the fast food industry, various recruiters for these companies who are running into a lot of problems, actually, staffing restaurants, and reducing some of the turnover that we see, which is at record levels right now, and keeping well-trained employees there. The management team at Chipotle, for example, has spoken about how they lost sight of that service side, about keeping restaurants clean, keeping the beverage and fountain machine clean, napkins off tables, trash off tables. I just thought it was interesting that, on the one hand, if you look out 10 to 20 years, you have this idea that you're going to eliminate the need for these employees entirely. But right now, even as they're testing things like these kiosks and tablets, which help eliminate the need, they're also running into issues keeping the restaurant staffed. The median wage for fast-food work in this country is $8 to $9 per hour. But Wal-Mart, just two years ago -- Kline: Went to $10. Shen: -- went to $10 across the country. Across their entire network of stores, at the minimum. They're running into this competition across all of retail. Kline: And I think you're seeing a justification for the companies that invested in employees. If you look at a Starbucks, which has healthcare and the college benefits, their turnover is less. I worked in retail, I ran a store. Just teaching someone all the procedures to run the register took months before they were good at it. If you're integrating someone onto the line at Chipotle, or working the fry later and knowing the procedural manual to clean the shake machine at McDonald's, which is horrifying, my wife having worked there in college -- that's not ice cream. But there's a huge opportunity cost. If you have been paying better all along, you might have actually been able to do it with less workers. Now, you're seeing a bit of a hierarchy. If I'm a worker at Dunkin' Donuts, I might be able to get hired at Starbucks, which will treat me better. If I'm a Taco Bell worker, maybe I can go to Chipotle or Starbucks. And you're going to start seeing the bottom of the chain -- during the last time we had a boom economy, my wife and I used to joke that you would go to the Dunkin' Donuts and the people working there would just point, and you wouldn't get what you wanted, but eventually they would get to something you like, and you would just take that anyway. And you're going to start to see real differences in service. As a country, you can argue what full employment means. But on a technical basis, we're at full employment, or right close to it, meaning there's not a huge pool of people -- there might be lots of people looking for better jobs, but there's not a huge pool of people looking for entry-level jobs. So you're going to start to see more teenagers. Starbucks doesn't hire a lot of 16 year olds in most markets. But you're probably going to see people like that, younger people, get some of these jobs, which can be good, but it's also a training issue, it's a scheduling issue because they can only work so many hours, they can't work during school, they can't work late at night. This is going to be a major factor, and for successful chains, it's going to force automation. Shen: Yeah. And we've talked before about how, ultimately, labor costs for a lot of these major chains, as much as 25% to 30% of their cost structure is there. It's interesting, trying to see them commit to this balancing act that they have, of making sure that right now, where they're not at the point where they can automate everything, having their employees be trained well, making sure the service experience is positive, and keeping customers coming back. Kline: I think if you're a worker -- I'm not 15 anymore, but I have a 13 year old child, and if he told me he wanted to be a manager someday of a restaurant chain, I would tell him to look at the ones that have a commitment to people. Starbucks has endlessly said and proven that with automation, they're not looking to replace workers, they're looking to shift the labor flow into production, meaning that there's always going to be an art to building a latte. Yes, you can go to Wawa and get a latte made by a machine, but that's not the same as one built by a person. If Starbucks is saying, ""Yeah, we may not have order takers who are people, but we're absolutely going to have customer service and baristas and product experts, and we're going to put in these upscale bars, and you'll be incentivized to learn more about coffee,"" well, those are the chains that are going to attract whatever worker pool there is. And I think McDonald's is going to automate, because it's a difficult job, there's some upward mobility but it's still a hot, sweaty, unpleasant place to work, for the most part. It's all going to sort itself out, as long as the economy stays strong. Shen: OK. Any final points, Dan, before we roll up here? Kline: I'm kind of hungry. Where are we going? We're thinking Shake Shack later. [laughs] ","

707,,6082017,Reuters,6012017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Police officers for the first time could be required to obtain warrants to get data on the past locations of criminal suspects based on cellphone use under a major case on privacy rights in the digital age taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. The justices agreed to hear an appeal by a man convicted in a series of armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan with the help of past cellphone location data who contends that without a warrant from a court such data amounts to an unreasonable search and seizure under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. Cellphone location records are becoming increasingly important to police in criminal investigations, with authorities routinely requesting and receiving this information from wireless providers. Police helped establish that the man at the center of the case, Timothy Carpenter, was near the scene of the robberies at Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores by securing past “cell site location information” from his cellphone carrier that tracked which local cellphone towers relayed his calls. The case reaches the high court amid growing scrutiny of the surveillance practices of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies amid concern among lawmakers across the political spectrum about civil liberties and police evading warrant requirements. The Supreme Court has twice in recent years ruled on major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, on each occasion ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. Two years later, the court said police need a warrant to search a cellphone that is seized during an arrest. The information that law enforcement agencies can obtain from wireless carriers shows which local cellphone towers users connect to at the time they make calls. Police can use historical data to determine if a suspect was in the vicinity of a crime scene or real-time data to track a suspect. Carpenter’s bid to suppress the evidence failed and he was convicted of six robbery counts. On appeal, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his convictions, finding that no warrant was required for the cellphone information. Civil liberties lawyers have said that police need “probable cause,” and therefore a warrant, in order to avoid constitutionally unreasonable searches. “Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives, police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberty Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project who represents Carpenter. “The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the longstanding protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records,” Wessler added. But, based on a provision of a 1986 federal law called the Stored Communications Act, the government said it does not need probable cause to obtain customer records. Instead, the government said, prosecutors must show only that there are “reasonable grounds” for the records and that they are “relevant and material” to an investigation. The case will be heard and decided in the court’s next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2018. The Trump administration said in court papers the government has a “compelling interest” for acquiring the records without a warrant because the information is particularly useful at the early stage of a criminal investigation. “Society has a strong interest in both promptly apprehending criminals and exonerating innocent suspects as early as possible during an investigation,” the administration said in a brief. David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, said warrants can be obtained quickly from judges but police may have problems getting the evidence needed to show probable cause. “They may not be able to get over that legal hurdle, so the court couldn’t issue the warrant,” LaBahn said. Civil liberties groups assert that the 1986 law did not anticipate the way mobile devices now contain a wealth of data on each user. Steve Vladeck, a national security and constitutional law professor at the University of Texas, said the case will have “enormous implications” over how much data the government can obtain from phone companies and other technology firms about their customers without a warrant. “Courts and commentators have tried to figure out exactly when individuals will have a continuing expectation of privacy even in data they’ve voluntarily shared with a third party,” Vladeck said. “This case squarely raises that question.” ","

708,Donna Fuscaldo,6082017,Investopedia,6012017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Verizon Communications (VZ) is reportedly gearing up to lay off as much as 1,000 jobs at both AOL and Yahoo as it begins the work of integrating its soon to be completed $4.5 billion acquisition of the internet company. Unnamed sources told Recode that the downsizing will likely happen across AOL and Yahoo and that if there are a thousand job cuts it would be less than 20% of the combined company. Reductions were expected given that Verizon and Yahoo have a lot over overlap, including in human resources, finance, marketing and general business administration. The acquisition, which was dragged out due to a massive cybersecurity breach of Yahoo’s user accounts, is expected to be closed next week after a shareholder meeting to approve the deal on Friday. The combined Yahoo and AOL is being rebranded as Oath: A Verizon Company. In April the wireless carrier announced the new name, which attracted plenty of ridicule across Silicon Valley and in the media, with comparisons being made to Tribune Publishing's notorious 2016 decision to rename itself Tronc. (See also: Verizon Finally Acquires Yahoo Core Operations.) According to a tweet from AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong at the time, Oath will oversee more than 20 brands and reach more than a billion consumers. Both the Yahoo and AOL brands are expected to survive, although Verizon refused to reveal any further details about the new entity until this summer. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) Recode’s sources claimed at the time that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who was at the helm of the internet giant for four years, which featured a prolonged trading downturn, will not be joining Oath. Those challenges, coupled with a reputation for lavish spending and mistimed acquisitions—e.g., paying $1.1 billion for social the blogging platform Tumblr—led many to expect Mayer’s departure. Recode added that Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products at Yahoo, is also likely to get the boot, while communications products head Jeff Bonforte is set to be one of the few executives to stay. Armstrong will soon make the rest of his choices on who stays and who leaves. At risk are Yahoo’s Chief Revenue Officer Lisa Utzschneider and advertising and search product boss Enrique Muñoz Torres.

709,Michael J. Kramer,6082017,Investopedia,6012017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A hotly debated topic among tech dealmakers has been how much Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO ) assets are worth. The new holding company for Yahoo will have its work cut for it after the company sells its search and other assets for an estimated $4.5 billion to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). If that deal is completed this month, Yahoo will shed its name and the holding company will be called Altaba Inc. How do you pronounce that new name? Al-ta-ba or Al-taba? That's a mouthful. No matter how you pronounce it, Altaba will operate as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The question every investor should ask themselves is this. Will the old Yahoo - under a new name - be good at managing the assets? YHOO Market Cap data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported an investment in Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) of $41.3 billion and an ownership interest in Yahoo Japan of $9.3 billion.  Yahoo beneficially owns 15.4 percent of Alibaba, representing 383.5 billion ordinary shares. Alibaba has a market cap as of June 1 of $310.99 billion, which would mean that Yahoo's current stake in Alibaba is roughly $47.89 billion. Yahoo Japan has a market cap of roughly $25.4 billion. Yahoo owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, representing a current market value of around $9.02 billion. YHOO Long Term Deferred Tax Liabilities (Quarterly) data by YCharts It seems like a no brainer right? Yahoo's current market cap - before the Verizon deal -  is $48.10 billion, and its stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is worth $56.91 billion. So Yahoo currently trades for less than the market value of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Then throw in that Yahoo shows cash and short-term marketable securities of $6.91 billion, then add the sale from Verizon of roughly $4.5 billion, it bring Yahoo's cash value to $11.41 billion. That takes the valuation for Yahoo up to $68.32 billion. YHOO Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts As of March 31, the company reported deferred tax liabilities for its Alibaba investment of $16.7 billion; this represents nearly 40 percent of the value of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba of $41.3 billion. As of December 31, Yahoo reported deferred tax liabilities of $13.6 billion, while its investment stake was $33.6 billion, representing 40 percent of the value of the stake. With a $48.10 billion valuation on its Alibaba stake, its tax deferred liability, using the same 40 percent, would be $19.46 billion. The company lists other long-term tax liabilities at $519.95 million. Also, the company recently announced a stock buy-back program of $3 billion. So based on these liabilities, how much is Yahoo worth then? It may be less than the current valuation the market is assigning to it. There's a big ""IF"" in all of this. First, can Yahoo figure out how to avoid the tax bill from its Alibaba stake? If not, and Altbaba has to pay that bill at some point, then you can subtract $20 billion from the value of its investment stake in Alibaba. That would be a big hit. Second, an investor in Altaba is hoping that this new investment company can avoid past mistakes made by Yahoo's management. So this means investors in the new Altaba will be betting on management's ability to navigate the company through a quagmire of financial issues and create value. That's a big IF at Altaba.

The idea is simple and appealing. Deliver easily prepared meals to clients' doors. Young professionals and harried homemakers can appreciate not having to stop at stores or draw up menus. Budding cooks can try out new dishes. Customers with few restaurant options nearby can try out cool recipes.

Verizon wouldn't be interested in an outright buyout of Pandora, sources say. Instead, the telecom giant is considering a $100 million investment. The deal would only happen if Sirius XM doesn't succeed in swallowing Sirius XM whole, and that's just as well. This isn't exactly a bidding war between Sirius XM and Verizon that would ultimately reward Pandora shareholders with a higher exit price, but Pandora's remaining independent would be an interesting consolation prize. Image source: Pandora. The spike in interest in Pandora doesn't come out of the blue. Ever since Pandora announced last month that it secured $150 million in financing from private equity firm KKR -- and that it would explore strategic alternatives in the 30 days leading up to the close of infusion -- it's been the equivalent of a bartender's final call for alcohol. An investment in Pandora would be dilutive for any potential acquirer, a field that presently only include Sirius XM if it's even making a play on the former dot-com darling at all. We'll have clarity on the situation soon enough, as Thursday marks 30 days since the announcement of KKR's investment and seemingly the deadline for Pandora to have found an acquirer. It's starting to seem as if the most likely scenario is that Sirius XM stays away, and both KKR and Verizon come in as investors. Both scenarios would be positive to Pandora's prospects as an ongoing business, making it a compelling investment in the single digits. ","

714,Daniel B. Kline,6082017,Fool,6012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) made a $10.54 billion bet on growth, and so far, it has not paid off. The company bought Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF). That gave Frontier approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband connections, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers, according to a press release. At the time the deal closed in April 2016, CEO Daniel McCarthy was excited and believed he had set his company up to succeed in the long term. ""This is a transformative acquisition for Frontier that delivers first-rate assets and important new opportunities given our dramatically expanded scale,"" he said. ""It significantly expands our presence in three high-growth, high-density states, and improves our revenue mix by increasing the percentage of our revenues coming from segments with the most promising growth potential."" The Verizon deal did make the company bigger and it did create an economy of scale. What McCarthy did not count on is that in all four quarters since the CTF purchase closed, Frontier has lost some of the customers it paid $10.54 billion for. Frontier has seen its subscriber counts move steadily in the wrong direction. Image source: Getty Images. When Frontier reported its Q2 2016 results McCarthy explained that it had lost customers partly due to the switchover from Verizon and partly due to the suspension of marketing activities. That tune continued in Q3, before the CEO introduced a new excuse in Q4. At the end of 2016, when Frontier reported the loss of 144,000 more residential customers as well as 14,000 business customers, McCarthy had a new excuse. He blamed the drop on Frontier getting rid of former Verizon customers who had not paid their bills. ""This process is almost complete, and we expect to return to a normalized trend by the start of the second quarter,"" he said in the Q4 earnings release. ""I am pleased that underlying CTF customer trends improved in Q4 and continue to improve in Q1."" That did not happen. In Q1 Frontier lost 155,000 residential customers and 18,000 business customers. Those are bigger losses than the previous quarter, and despite the company and its CEO continually saying the trend will reverse, there is little reason to believe it will. The company needs to show it can stop customers from leaving and attract new ones. McCarthy has done a very good job managing expenses and squeezing operational efficiency out of his newly larger company. Still, even though he has delivered $1.25 billion in annualized cost synergies at the end of Q1, you can't cut your way to success. If Frontier keeps losing around 160,000 subscribers each quarter some of those cost savings gained from being bigger will start to disappear. That's a very realistic scenario because while McCarthy delivers credible excuses for the drops, he has not shown he knows how to stop them. Frontier may well be falling victim to the cord cutting impacting most of its competitors. It also appears to have lost momentum as an alternative to the established players in cable, likely because so many new options have popped up in recent months. Those may not be solvable problems. Frontier may well be a tire with a slow leak where at first it does not seem so bad, but eventually the problem leads to a blow out. ","

T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is the fastest-growing postpaid wireless carrier in the United States. That said, it still has a long way to go to catch up to the massive subscriber bases of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). But T-Mobile CFO Braxton Carter said there are two major growth drivers for the company that could allow it to continue adding millions of new subscribers to its platform for years to come. First, it's still expanding its distribution footprint to catch up to its nationwide network coverage. Second, its improved network coverage will allow it to penetrate the enterprise market. T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image source: T-Mobile Carter says the company's current store footprint only reaches about 230 million people in the United States. Meanwhile, it expects its network to cover 320 million people by the end of the year. T-Mobile is quickly expanding the number of stores it's opening. It expects to open an additional 1,000 stores by mid-year, with 500 more by the end of the year. Overall, Carter expects the stores to reach an additional 30 million to 40 million people. Importantly, T-Mobile will be able to leverage its nationwide advertising. It already has brand recognition in these areas; it just doesn't have stores to serve the customer base. As it opens stores, it could quickly ramp up its share of the market. What's more, the competition in these new areas is less intense than in the metro areas where T-Mobile currently plays. Instead of the four or more competitors traditionally present in metro areas, in these more rural markets Carter says there are only two or three. That means it'll be easier for T-Mobile to take share. In established metro areas, T-Mobile takes as much as 30% of the market. Carter sees no reason T-Mobile can't eventually reach those levels nationwide. But in a five-plus-year time horizon, he expects ""substantial inroads into the teens"" in terms of market share. That implies an addition of about 5 million customers over the next five years. More than likely, many of those customers will come from AT&T and Verizon. The two have had leading nationwide network coverage for years. But each has been bleeding subscribers to T-Mobile for awhile, and its store footprint expansion could exacerbate the problem. There are over 100 million enterprise phone customers in the United States, according to Carter. T-Mobile has less than 5% of those customers. ""Given where our network is today, there's no reason we can't have our fair share of that marketplace,"" he said. T-Mobile plans to bring the same Un-carrier initiatives that helped it succeed in its retail business to the enterprise market. Things such as including text and data in over 150 countries with its plans or more transparent pricing ought to appeal to business customers as much as they do to retail customers. AT&T's business-solutions segment continues to add new customers, mostly at the cost of its own retail customers. The company's enterprise segment now boasts over 82 million connections and over 50 million postpaid phone subscribers. That makes it likely the largest enterprise service provider in the country, putting a target on its back for T-Mobile. The enterprise opportunity is massive for T-Mobile. It ought to be able to grow its share of the market to close to its current market share for non-enterprise, which stands as high as 30% in some metro areas. Even if it just reaches the mid-teens, that's another 10 million or so subscribers who could join T-Mobile over the next few years. Combine enterprise with its expanding footprint as well as its continued execution in the territories it's already doing well in, and T-Mobile has a lot of subscriber growth left in it over the next few years.

Proprietary content can keep customers loyal. That's the logic behind Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ill-fated go90 platform. The problem, and it's a big one, is that creating content people actually want presents major challenges. In addition, go90 launched at a time when consumers have an unprecedented amount of content to choose from. Verizon, which spent $200 million on content for the service and another $80 million marketing it in 2016, according to Business Insider, also made the mistake of entering a market already owned by YouTube. go90 was an attempt to lure millennials, a generation particularly resistant to craven marketing efforts. It was an attempt that was badly off base and failed quickly. go90 still exists, but it has been dramatically scaled back, with 155 full-time staff losing their jobs in January, Deadline reported. Verizon hoped to lure young people in with go90. Image source: Getty Images. When it blows hundreds of millions of dollars on an idea that never had any hopes of working, a company like Verizon won't admit it made a mistake. Instead, it releases a statement like this one: Our focus with go90 and our Verizon digital media efforts are to fulfill our strategy of leveraging Verizon content investments, enhancing user experience, and strengthening our advertising infrastructure. Fulfilling this strategy has resulted in some duplicative resources and has required organizational changes impacting 155 employees as we consolidate offices in Los Angeles, San Jose, and New York. That's a whole lot of corporate gobbledygook to avoid saying what a terrible idea spending so much trying to create viral videos was. Of course, shareholders and the 155 who lost their job were probably delighted to hear that ""these changes are not indicative to a change in our strategy."" The biggest mistake Verizon made with go90 was attempting to launch it based on spending big. It would have made more sense to take a slower, more grassroots approach. That's how Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Hulu, and Amazon.com entered the content game. Verizon instead had the hubris to assume that it could throw money at the problem and millennials would be easy to lure in. That would seem to be the case given the enormous volume of highly watched yet awful content on YouTube, but that platform had the advantage of being first. At best, go90 was a me-too player in an already crowded field, and in reality it was never really a player at all. In addition, breaking into episodic programming and viral videos requires both talent and luck. All of the aforementioned platforms, as well as the broadcast networks and cable channels that produce original content, sometimes fail with shows that deserve an audience. There was no reason to believe that Verizon -- even a deep-pocketed Verizon -- would have quick and easy success in the content space. It's easy to see why Verizon wants to have a draw beyond a high-priced wireless service. The advantage its network once had over lower-cost rivals Sprint and T-Mobile has shrunk, taking away what has been its key marketing pitch. Owning content that people want to watch would be that draw. The problem is that creating content that keeps people paying for a service that costs more than its rivals isn't easy. HBO, Netflix, and very few others have been able to achieve that. Maybe in time go90 would have gotten there, but it doesn't seem likely. ","

AT&T (NYSE:T) is a television and wireless juggernaut, and it's using its heft in both markets to attract new subscribers. The company's most recent move is to offer a $25 discount on video services to wireless customers subscribing to its Unlimited Choice plan. The move follows a similar offer tied to its more expensive Unlimited Plus plan. At $60 per month for a single line, AT&T's Unlimited Choice plan is already priced below similar plans from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Offering a video package for as little as $10 per month on top of that makes it an excellent value for individuals. And with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) entering the wireless market, AT&T is really stepping up its bundle promotions to remain competitive. Image source: AT&T. As mentioned, AT&T's single-line pricing is less than Verizon and T-Mobile's. Granted, AT&T imposes added restrictions on its Unlimited Choice plan to keep the price low. Subscribers that don't want those restrictions would have to pay an extra $30 per month, making the plan more expensive than comparable plans on T-Mobile and Verizon. That said, the second line pricing for AT&T is comparably very expensive. T-Mobile offers significant savings versus AT&T for family plans especially considering its recent move to include taxes and fees in its pricing. In fact, the savings on a two-line account are enough to completely offset the $25 video discount for some subscribers. That's important to note because there's an industrywide push toward more family plans. Both T-Mobile and Verizon have seen the average number of devices per account steadily climb over the past couple years. Multi-line accounts generally exhibit lower churn rates, allowing a carrier to grow faster without having to find as many gross additions. AT&T may be trying to zig while the competitors zag, specifically targeting single-line customers. Offering a substantial discount on video service should help keep churn lower than otherwise. Comcast is taking a similar approach with its wireless plan pricing, which is only really attractive if you're also subscribing to Comcast's high-end video and internet package. AT&T has lost postpaid phone subscribers for 10 straight quarters dating back to the end of 2014. Additionally, it lost 233,000 video subscribers last quarter, and DIRECTV Now isn't adding any new subscribers either. AT&T is getting desperate to add new high-value customers, but doing it one customer at a time is a lot more difficult than adding three or four lines at once. It requires a lot more marketing expenses and customer acquisition costs with a higher risk of defection just a few months later. It's already shown an inability to hold onto customers if and when its promotions end. It's experiencing significant customer losses from U-Verse video as it stops its footprint expansion and customers' promotional discounts end. DIRECTV Now lost 3,000 subscribers in February after many users signed up for a ""free Apple TV"" after committing to three months of service. Unless AT&T plans to subsidize its already low-margin DIRECTV Now business indefinitely, this bundle is just a band aid instead of a real fix to its subscriber loss problem.

718,Andrew Tonner,6082017,Fool,6012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Finding the best telecom stock on the market today is a matter of process of elimination. Smaller wireless providers such as Sprint and T-Mobile don't pay dividends, instead reinvesting all of their profits and excess cash flows back into their businesses. Since many telecom investors target the sector for its rich history of cash distributions, we can strike these two from the list. Without turning to international wireless stocks, we find that telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offer the same 5.1% dividend yield. So deciding between these two wireless rivals comes down to which offers the better growth prospects. The winner on that front is AT&T. Let's see why. No other telecom comes close to AT&T's credentials as a dividend stock, though Verizon deserves credit for its high yield. AT&T's track record of consistently growing its payouts stands head and shoulders above its industry counterparts. The company has increased its annual dividend per share for an impressive 32 years running, earning it the much-desired title of a Dividend Aristocrat. It already increased its annual payout for 2017, raising its quarterly cash distribution from $0.48 to $0.49 per share. Though it's grown its payouts in steady annual intervals for longer than I've been alive, the company has grown its dividends at a fairly glacial pace. As I noted in another piece, AT&T's dividend's compound average growth rate totaled a meager 3.2% over the past decade. However, the company claims its pending acquisition of Time Warner -- more on that in a moment -- will be accretive to its adjusted EPS, free cash flow, and dividend payout coverage this year, assuming the deal closes on time. Given AT&T's 95% dividend payout ratio, this news should comfort income investors. Better still, AT&T's purchase of Time Warner will provide the company with even more significant competitive advantages to shape the converging future of the telecom and media industries. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to its prominence as an income investment, AT&T has a good chance to grow faster than the industry averages in the coming years, in part thanks to the leadership position it should be able to establish in bringing cable TV services onto wireless networks. The key lies in AT&T's pending acquisition of Time Warner. The $85.4 billion cash-and-stock deal is expected to close by the end of the year as most critical regulatory hurdles have been cleared. With Time Warner added into its corporate fold, only AT&T and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) will own the requisite mix of content assets and wireless spectrum necessary to drive this trend forward. As one of the largest wireless providers in the country, AT&T has a national wireless network that's already well positioned in terms of its spectrum bandwidth ownership and cell-tower deployments. The company will need to continue to invest in faster wireless standards such as 5G, but the company is well under way in its preparations to bring 5G to mainstream deployment, starting as soon as this year. Time Warner also factors into this strategy, in terms of content rights. Along with Comcast, AT&T stands to considerably strengthen its competitive position by launching an over-the-top wireless cable service. It seems likely the company will combine a new wireless cable service with its current cellular, internet, and other services to create a highly competitive bundle that peers such as Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile will struggle to replicate. The advantage of having Time Warner is that it should allow AT&T to secure the over-the-top broadcast rights from other cable providers that might otherwise be leery of allowing AT&T to become so powerful. One useful example is Comcast, which provides cable subscriptions to 22.4 million consumers and owns networks such as NBC, Bravo, and USA Network. Though Comcast will probably launch its own wireless cable offering, AT&T could gain a first-mover advantage if it beats the cable giant to market. While that might give Comcast an incentive to withhold over-the-top rights from AT&T, that situation probably wouldn't last since Comcast also needs Time Warner's content assets for its current cable offerings and to eventually launch its own service and if AT&T owns them, that would forces the rivals to the negotiating table. This all involves a fair amount of speculation on my part, though it seems like a logical set of steps for the parties involved. Time Warner should allow AT&T to take a leadership position in the next era of the cable business, which should allow it to grow its earnings and dividends in the years to come. ","

Long-term investing is often talked about in terms of a few years in today's stock market. But at The Motley Fool, we love to find stocks we can hold for decades and make money on over the very, very long term. We asked three of our contributors which stocks they want to own for the next 50 years, and SYSCO Corporation (NYSE:SYY), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) made the top of their lists. Reuben Gregg Brewer (SYSCO Corporation): SYSCO Corporation is the largest food distributor in the United States, serving restaurants, schools, and hospitals, among other customers. It also operates in Canada and Mexico, and recently bought a large European food distributor to expand its reach into a new market. Food distribution is a highly fragmented industry with ample opportunity for SYSCO to do ""bolt-on"" deals, which have been its bread and butter for decades. The company has faced two notable problems, lately. The first was a failed attempt to buy US Foods, one of SYSCO's largest U.S. competitors. The hope was to achieve cost savings through that deal that would improve SYSCO's margins, which had been falling since 2010. Weak margins in an already low-margin business is the second big problem. With the deal scuttled, however, SYSCO has renewed its focus on improving its own operations. And that's led to a notable operating-margin improvement over the last year. SYY Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. SYSCO is clearly aware of the problem, is dealing with it, and achieving success. That's actually not so surprising from a company that's increased its dividend for 47 years and counting. The dividend-growth rate has slowed to about the rate of inflation over the last few years, but over the past decade, the annualized growth rate has been roughly twice that level. With a solid 2.5% yield, as well as a long history of successfully expanding via acquisition in a fragmented industry and rewarding investors along the way, SYSCO is the type of company you can own for a very long time. Tim Green (McDonald's): Restaurants, perhaps more than any other type of business, come and go. The industry is brutal, with no barrier to entry driving intense and unending competition. But McDonald's is no ordinary restaurant. The company has been around for decades, and its business model of having most of its restaurants run by franchisees is wildly profitable. McDonald's earned $4.7 billion of net income last year on $24.6 billion of revenue. Image source: McDonald's. In order to thrive for another 50 years, McDonald's will need to change with the times. McDonald's now offers delivery through the UberEATS service in some cities, and it plans to roll out mobile ordering and pickup to all of its U.S. restaurants by the end of the year. McDonald's is a laggard when it comes to digital strategy, but it's aiming to catch up quickly. If I had to bet on any restaurant chain being around in 50 years, it would be McDonald's. The company is nearly recession-proof, with its focus on low prices driving sales in even the worst of times. Revenue dipped slightly in 2009 during the financial crisis, but it quickly recovered, and the bottom line was completely unaffected. McDonald's has thrived during its first 50 years, and it will likely do the same for decades to come. Travis Hoium (Verizon): Besides food and housing, I think one thing that will be similar 50 years from now as it is today is data flowing through the air wirelessly, and then being disseminated to other people or things. Maybe it'll be phone calls, or maybe it'll be data from self-driving cars, or maybe personal drones will need to communicate with central command wirelessly. Whatever it is, I think Verizon is well positioned to be at the center of that wireless-communications future. You can see below that Verizon is essentially tied with AT&T as the most profitable U.S. telecommunications company. This gives Verizon a powerful position in a market with very few players and the cash flow needed to upgrade its network, when necessary. VZ Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the next few years, we'll see Verizon's strong position playing out as it rolls out a 5G network, starting with an 11-city pilot by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Sprint and T-Mobile don't plan on rolling out 5G until 2019. As more devices become connected and the Internet of Things grows, Verizon's network will become more and more valuable. Fifty years from now, this still will be a company that will likely be making tons of money for investors. And getting a 5% dividend yield in the meantime is a nice way to generate cash from a great long-term investment. ","

For those unfamiliar with the telecom titan, AT&T (NYSE:T) may not look like the best bet in telecom today. Case in point, the wireless giant's shares have dramatically underperformed the broader market averages over the past 12 months and year to date in 2017. T data by YCharts. However, its recent performance obscures two important reasons AT&T remains a compelling buy. Here's why the telecom giant's powerful combination of dividend payments and growth potential makes it my top pick in the telecom sector today. Let's start with the past and present before moving on to the future. Working within this construct, AT&T's impressive history as an income investment is particularly noteworthy. As I have cited in many prior posts, AT&T's potent mix of historical dividend growth and current yield earn it my vote for the best dividend stock in the telecom industry. Here are two important figures you should know that help support this point: That said, AT&T stock is not necessarily the embodiment of dividend perfection, either; it has some important risk factors. Namely, the company currently pays out almost all of its net income -- a 95% dividend payout ratio at most recent count -- as dividends. However, it's important to note that the cash-rich nature of AT&T's business model means its actual cash flows are far larger than its accounting income. Case in point, AT&T's cash flows from operations totaled $40.6 billion versus $12.6 billion in income attributable to common shareholders over the past 12 months, so the metaphorical well from which AT&T can pay its dividends is much deeper than a metric like payout ratio suggests. Equally important, its paltry dividend growth rate also detracts from AT&T's status as an otherwise great dividend stock. The company has only increased its cash payouts at an average annual rate of just 3.2% each year over the past decade. Of course, some growth is better than none, but this falls well short of some of the top dividend growth stocks on the market today. Fortunately, AT&T has one extremely important growth driver in place that should allow the wireless giant to continue its rich tradition of overall dividend excellence for years to come. Image source: Getty Images. Last October, AT&T struck a deal to acquire TV and movie programming giant Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in an $85.4 billion stock-and-cash deal. The deal stands as just one of AT&T's recent mega-deals -- its $48.5 billion buyout of DirecTV in 2014 also deserves note, here -- but this buyout holds the key to AT&T's vision to bring cable broadcasts directly to mobile devices. Let's walk through the steps involved in this investing thesis since it can seem somewhat unintuitive. In a sense, the deal is all about leverage. AT&T already owns the requisite spectrum to launch its own wireless cable service in the coming years, especially as 5G networks come online toward the end of the decade. It also counts 146.8 million wireless customers and 38.7 million TV subscribers to whom it could distribute this type of product. However, AT&T will likely need to secure additional content distribution rights from major content powers like Comcast to broadcast their channels via its over-the-top service. In theory, large cable producers could simply refuse to license these new terms, essentially blocking AT&T from launching what figures to be a highly compelling offering. However, with Time Warner's cable assets like CNN, TNT, TBS, and more, AT&T can leverage its own content assets to bring other cable companies to the table. At least in this sense, Time Warner's strategic value is akin to a massive insurance policy. Expect AT&T combine this new wireless cable service with its current cellular, internet, and other product offerings. Since only Comcast should be in a position to match AT&T on this front, it certainly seems plausible that AT&T could use its wireless cable to steal wireless customers away from rivals like Verizon Communications, T-Mobile, Sprint, and more. Seen through this lens, there certainly appears to be ample evidence to remain bullish on AT&T stock in the years to come. ","
      
    Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for AT&T, Inc. -- The Motley Fool

721,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",6082017,Fool,6012017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A stock's share price all by itself isn't very meaningful. A company with 1,000 shares of stock trading for $10 and another company with 10,000 shares trading for $1 are worth the exact same amount of money. Having said that, there are certain advantages to lower-priced stocks. In addition to making it more economical to employ certain options strategies, a lower share price allows smaller, everyday investors to put more of their money to work right away. Think of it this way. Let's say you have $300 from your last paycheck to invest, and you want to buy a telecom stock. If you choose AT&T, which trades for $38.24 as I write, you can afford to buy seven shares, leaving about $32 of your money uninvested. On the other hand, if you choose Sprint, which trades for just $8.41, you can buy 35 shares and leave less than $6 on the table -- perhaps just enough to cover your trading commission (depending on your broker). The point is that you aren't leaving as much cash on the sidelines with the lower-priced stock. With that in mind, here are three stocks that look attractive right now, all of which have sub-$10 price tags. Then read on for a little bit about the potential of each one. Company Industry Recent Stock Price Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) Mining $5.69 Sprint Corp. (NYSE:S) Telecommunications $8.87 Fitbit Inc. (NYSE:FIT) Wearable technology $5.51 Stock prices are current as of June 2, 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Iron ore miner Cliffs Natural Resources has been beaten down quite a bit in recent months. The stock trades for less than $6 per share, and just three months ago, it wouldn't have qualified for this list. However, I think Cliffs looks rather interesting after the drop. The company has done an excellent job of paying off debt and would have been profitable in the first quarter if it hadn't prudently spent money for that purpose. Debt is still a little too high for comfort, but it has fallen by almost 25% in 2017 alone. In a nutshell, Cliffs has done a good job of improving its financial condition, and recent drops in iron ore have made the stock much cheaper over the past few months. As the largest supplier of iron ore pellets to U.S. steelmakers, Cliffs stands to benefit tremendously over the next few years, especially if President Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan becomes a reality, given his pro-U.S. steel stance. Cliffs is still a highly speculative investment, so approach it with caution, but if the company's turnaround efforts continue to be successful, and commodity prices cooperate, investors with the patience to wait and the stomach for some volatility along the way could be handsomely rewarded. Sprint is a somewhat different investment from rival telecom giants AT&T and Verizon. Specifically, while AT&T and Verizon both have massive, high-quality wireless networks, Sprint's focus is to compete on price. The company is much smaller in scale than those other two and operates at a significantly lower profit margin. And the company's latest quarter produced a net loss of $0.07 per share, while sales fell short of analyst estimates. Even so, there are reasons to be positive on Sprint. The company added 187,000 net new subscribers during the quarter and was able to report positive free cash flow for the first time in years. Sprint has been in an ongoing effort to turn the company around, and while it remains to be seen whether it will ultimately be successful, if the company's earnings start to look impressive, there could be lots of upside potential for shareholders. Shares of wearable-technology company Fitbit have been absolutely crushed since the company's 2015 IPO. The stock has fallen 82% from its first trading day and nearly 90% from its peak. It's fair to say that the market's euphoria on Fitbit has cooled off significantly. FIT data by YCharts The recent numbers aren't too promising. In its most recent quarter, Fitbit's revenue fell 41% year over year, and the company lost $0.15 per share, down from a profit of $0.10 a year ago. And as my colleague Leo Sun pointed out recently, the company's market share plunged from 29% at the end of 2015 to 19.2% at the end of last year. Despite the numbers, Fitbit could still have some tricks up its sleeve. New products are expected to launch this fall, including a successor to the Blaze smartwatch that's rumored to have some Apple Watch-beating features. Only time will tell if consumers will embrace the next generation of Fitbit products, but if they do, there is tremendous upside potential. Of course, given its low price, the company could also be an attractive takeover target. As I mentioned, Cliffs and Fitbit are stocks that I consider to be quite speculative, so if you choose to invest, be sure you can stomach the volatility that will undoubtedly occur, and don't put in money you can't afford to lose. Having said that, I consider all three of these stocks attractive from a risk-reward perspective, and over time, all three have the potential to deliver outstanding returns in your portfolio.

With the stock market hovering near all-time highs, it can be a smart idea to think a little defensively in your portfolio. However, that doesn't mean you need to give up your growth potential if the market keeps rising. Blue chip dividend stocks have historically performed better than their non-dividend counterparts during tough times, and many have outperformed the overall market over long time periods. With that in mind, here are five of the largest dividend payers in the market, all of which pay out more than $5 billion per year to shareholders and could make excellent additions to your portfolio now. Company Recent Stock Price Dividend Yield Annual Dividends Paid ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) $81.55 3.8% $12.9 billion AT&T (NYSE:T) $38.12 5.1% $12.0 billion Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $52.41 2.9% $7.6 billion Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) $87.25 3.2% $7.2 billion International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) $152.49 3.9% $5.6 billion Data source: CNBC and author's calculations. Stock prices, dividend yields, and annualized dividend rates are current as of May 29, 2017. Annual dividends paid are calculated by multiplying the current quarterly dividend rate by four, and then multiplying by the number of outstanding shares. Integrated oil giant ExxonMobil is one of the largest companies in the world, so it should be no surprise that it's also one of the biggest dividend payers. One major reason to like Exxon is for the diversification of its business. The company has operations in offshore and onshore oil drilling, chemicals, refining, and more. And while much of Exxon's revenue suffers when oil prices fall, some areas of the business actually tend to do better. For example, as my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out, 2015 was a terrible year for Exxon's drilling operations, but the company's refining business more than doubled its profits. As far as the dividend goes, Exxon is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats index, having raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years, and pays 3.8% as of this writing. Considering the company's financial strength and profitability, the streak shouldn't be in jeopardy anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. Telecom giant AT&T is a favorite stock among dividend-seeking investors, and for good reason -- its 5.1% yield is among the best you'll find from such a stable company. And like Exxon, AT&T has a streak of consecutive dividend increases that exceeds three decades. There are a few good reasons to like AT&T over the long term. For one thing, AT&T has a pending acquisition of Time Warner. That will add all of the latter's content, helping AT&T to keep building a moat around its business, and allowing it to continue to bundle more and more services together -- potentially capturing market share from rivals such as Verizon and Sprint. Wells Fargo has significantly underperformed the rest of the banking sector over the past nine months or so, as a result of the now-infamous ""fake accounts"" scandal. This was certainly a major misstep by the bank, and the fallout from the scandal is obvious. The bank's non-interest income has fallen significantly, expenses are up, and the bank's normally strong efficiency ratio has suffered. Having said that, I believe that the effects of the scandal will be temporary. Wells Fargo remains one of the most well-run banks in the world, in terms of risk management, efficiency of operations, and profitability. The bank has consistently delivered better returns on equity and assets than its rivals, while maintaining a relatively low-risk asset portfolio. Consumer product giant Procter & Gamble's strength lies in its vast portfolio of well-known brand names, including Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Downy, just to name a few. To be clear, there certainly are some challenges facing Procter & Gamble going forward. For example, discounted and subscription-based razor competitors such as Dollar Shave Club have cost the Gillette brand market share in recent years. However, the long-term outlook is still strong for P&G shareholders. The company has proactively shed non-core brands to focus on its biggest winners, and has done an excellent job of controlling costs and boosting margins. Finally, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks of consecutive dividend increases in the market at 60 years and counting. It was recently disclosed that Warren Buffett had unloaded about 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's massive stake in International Business Machines, better known as IBM. Buffett said that the company was facing strong competition, and therefore he had valued its stock ""somewhat downward."" However, don't be too quick to abandon IBM -- Buffett still owns more than 50 million shares of the tech giant, and the central reasons Buffett bought IBM in the first place still apply. For one thing, IBM still has great relationships with large organizations, which not only provide stability to its revenue, but also give the company a strong base on which to grow with new product developments. The business also has ""stickiness,"" meaning that it would cost its customers a lot of money to choose a new provider for the integrated solutions (hardware, software, and services) that IBM provides.

    5 Dividend Stocks That Pay Out Over $5 Billion a Year -- The Motley Fool

That was well above consensus expectations of 36% growth as of May 31, according to a FactSet survey of Wall Street analysts, and compares with 2017 growth of 47%. The comments sent Alibaba’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) soaring $16.70, or 13.3%, toward a record close of $142.34, adding about $43.1 billion to the company’s market capitalization. That marked the biggest one-day price and percentage gains since the ADRs made their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 19, 2014.

                                   a deal that is expected to close next week, but has left investors hanging for years as it tries to figure out a way to best monetize its Alibaba holdings. As of March 31, Yahoo still owned 384 million ordinary shares of Alibaba, according to recent filings, which based on Alibaba ADR prices valued that stake at $41.41 billion at that time. Don’t miss: Yahoo shelves plans to spin off Alibaba stake, to focus on spinning off core business. See also from January 2015: Yahoo announces plan to spin off alibaba stake Given that 1 ADR represents 1 ordinary share, Thursday’s rally in Alibaba’s ADRs would boost the value of Yahoo’s stake by $6.41 billion. And since Dec. 8, 2015, when Yahoo said it was shelving its plan to spin off the stake, the value of that stake has ballooned by $22.26 billion, which compares with Yahoo’s current market cap of $52.38 billion. Alibaba’s ADRs are now worth more than double the initial public offering price of $68. They have rocketed 62.1% year to date, while shares of Yahoo have rallied 44.1% and those of U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.

Comey’s testimony is part of a litany of potentially market-moving events playing out over the next 24 hours, including an earlier decision by the European Central Bank to keep its monetary policy unchanged and a U.K. snap election. However, Wall Street investors have signaled that events don’t appear to threaten the stock market’s extended push into record territory, which has been driven by President Donald Trump’s promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Comey’s statement, released Wednesday, suggested he was worried Trump had sought to secure his “loyalty” and wanted him to help “lift the cloud” from the investigation into possible Russian interference in the U.S. election was casting. Comey also confirmed the president’s assertion that the director had repeatedly assured Trump that the Federal Bureau of Investigation hadn’t opened an investigation into him. He reiterated those assertions during his testimony in front of the Senate panel. Engelke, meanwhile, believes that the House passage of legislation to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill is likely to accelerate circulation of capital in the markets and boost economic activity. Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, said absent any surprises, recent events suggests that the stock market should drift higher. “Ultimately, stock markets are going to reflect earnings,” he said. Orlando said the U.S. and Europe are showing strong quarterly results that may help to support gains in stocks that some strategists and investors view as overvalued. Earlier in the day, the ECB, as expected, left interest rates unchanged but said it continued to expect interest rates “to remain at present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon” of its asset-buying program, which is set to run at least through December. In previous statements, the ECB had said it expected rates “to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.” Check out: A recap of the ECB’s Mario Draghi news conference Read: Why the ECB can take only ‘baby steps’ toward ending ultraloose monetary policy Beyond the ECB and Comey, investors also were focused on the U.K. general election, In the U.K., voters headed to the polls in an election that turned out to be much more uncertain than predicted. Opinion polls are still giving Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party the lead, but the big question is whether the party will increase its majority in parliament.

                                   may have just pulled in some new customers. The retailer announced this week it will offer its Prime membership, which gives consumers access to services including free shipping and Amazon-exclusive television shows, for $5.99 a month to consumers who are on government assistance programs. Prime usually costs $10.99 a month, or $99 per year. To qualify, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks like a debit card. It is the card those receiving SNAP funds or cash benefits use. Retail experts have said it seems to be an effort for Amazon to compete with Wal-Mart

                                   which already has a large percentage of consumers on government assistance among its clientele. Wal-Mart had some $13 billion in sales in 2016 from shoppers who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), accounting for 18% of the money spent on that program, according to The Wall Street Journal. Amazon will add more ways to qualify for those who participate in government programs that do not require EBT cards, a company spokeswoman said. Amazon offers a 30-day free trial period. It’s a move somewhat similar to offering senior citizens discounts, said George Barany, the director of strategic initiatives for America Saves, a division of the Consumer Federation of America, an association of nonprofit consumer organizations based in Washington, D.C. Don’t miss: 5 tech stocks for the long run This isn’t the first time Amazon has gone after customers who have lower incomes: In April, it announced a program called Amazon Cash that allows customers to add money to their Amazon account if they don’t have a debit or credit card. Some 7% of households in the U.S. do not use banking accounts at insured institutions, and this program would allow them to still shop online through Amazon.

                                   offer discounted service for people with low incomes through a government-assistance program called Lifeline. And individual cultural institutions, such as the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, sometimes offer discounts to those on government assistance as well. Lower-income households are a lucrative target market. The spending habits of people with low incomes are complicated and sometimes misunderstood. For one thing, it is hard for many low-income households to predict what their incomes will be from month to month, or even day to day, said Clinton Key, the research officer for savings and financial security at Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit based in Philadelphia. As a result, many families have developed sophisticated systems for budgeting and making sure they know where every dollar goes, he said. And that’s good news for Amazon, big-box stores and cell phone companies that charge regular monthly fees. For people with steady, reliable and sizable housing, buying in bulk can alleviate some of those worries, Key said. For those who can’t rely on transportation, online ordering helps. See also: A third of American families have ‘roller coaster’ finances But signing on for subscription services, which require a monthly payment, can also be difficult for families that budget carefully, Key said. One example: Many buy cellphone plans with prepaid minutes instead of a recurring monthly charge because of this, he said. And “one-click ordering” on Amazon isn’t necessarily smart for someone who needs to count every dollar. In fact, discounting the Prime membership has a “negligible” benefit for these consumers, he added. Retailers also know that lower-income customers like to splurge too, especially when it comes to special occasions. For example, families with lower incomes actually spend more on high school proms than those with higher incomes, according to Visa

Of course, it’s hard to get bigger when interest-rate sensitive REITs are under pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to move toward tighter monetary policy. As rates rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for this capital-intensive sector, investors continue to tread lightly, as seen by the performance of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund

727,,6152017,Reuters,6082017,"The completion of the acquisition marked the end of Yahoo as a stand-alone internet company, a tech pioneer once valued at more than $100 billion. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless operator, is combining Yahoo with AOL, which it bought two years ago, to form a venture called Oath, led by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Oath’s more than 50 brands include HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr. “Given the inherent changes to my role, I’ll be leaving the company,” Mayer wrote in an email to employees on Tuesday that she also posted on Tumblr. “However, I want all of you to know that I’m brimming with nostalgia, gratitude, and optimism.” Armstrong told employees in a separate note seen by Reuters that the combined company’s services “reach over a billion people each month.” He added that “accomplishing our objectives and goals will require adjustments to the company.” He said the “opportunity in front of us is not about the opinions from the pundits and it is not about the competition, it is about our ability to maniacally focus on delivering magical services to mobile enabled consumers.” The closing of the deal, announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. Reuters reported last week that Verizon planned to cut about 2,000 jobs, or 15 percent, of the 14,000 employees at its Yahoo and AOL units. Verizon is expected to make cuts as early as Wednesday. Yahoo cut 15 percent of its workforce last year and AOL cut 500 jobs. Thomas McInerney, a Yahoo board member, will become Altaba’s chief executive officer.

730,,6152017,Reuters,6082017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sprint Corp is offering free unlimited data, talk and text for a year in an aggressive promotion launched on Tuesday, aimed at Verizon customers in an oversaturated U.S. wireless market. Customers who switch to Sprint before June 30 and bring their own devices will get free service until July 31, 2018, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier said. After that, Sprint’s regular rates for unlimited plans will kick in, at $60 per month for a single line. The promotion mainly targets Verizon Communications Inc customers through digital advertising, Sprint spokesman David Tovar said by phone. Sprint shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $8.26. Verizon fell 1.5 percent, and both T-Mobile US Inc and AT&T Inc lost about 1 percent. The S&P 500 Telecommunications Services Index was the weakest of the benchmark S&P Index’s 11 sectors after the launch, with a 1 percent decline mostly driven by Verizon and AT&T. Since the offer will be promoted digitally rather than on television, the cost of winning customers is lower than for Sprint’s other unlimited plan promotions. Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research note on Tuesday called the offer “arguably the most aggressive promotion in the history of the U.S. wireless industry.” All four major U.S. wireless carriers have been sweetening their unlimited plan offers, prompting concerns from industry analysts about an accelerating price war. But Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said the promotion “makes a really big splash in a really small pool,” noting that it primarily applied to Verizon users because of the phones that are eligible.

731,,6152017,Reuters,6082017,"BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months. Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers. Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters. “Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.” Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses. Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking. BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion. Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings. Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March. Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry. The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc. Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations. That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings. “It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.” And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business. Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar. He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books. With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty. BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020. Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it. “It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.” BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year. On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer. AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said. The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said. The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies. Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million. Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020. “The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020. “Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.

Unnamed sources told Recode that the downsizing will likely happen across AOL and Yahoo and that if there are a thousand job cuts it would be less than 20% of the combined company. Reductions were expected given that Verizon and Yahoo have a lot over overlap, including in human resources, finance, marketing and general business administration. The acquisition, which was dragged out due to a massive cybersecurity breach of Yahoo’s user accounts, is expected to be closed next week after a shareholder meeting to approve the deal on Friday. The combined Yahoo and AOL is being rebranded as Oath: A Verizon Company. In April the wireless carrier announced the new name, which attracted plenty of ridicule across Silicon Valley and in the media, with comparisons being made to Tribune Publishing's notorious 2016 decision to rename itself Tronc. (See also: Verizon Finally Acquires Yahoo Core Operations.) According to a tweet from AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong at the time, Oath will oversee more than 20 brands and reach more than a billion consumers. Both the Yahoo and AOL brands are expected to survive, although Verizon refused to reveal any further details about the new entity until this summer. (See also: Revised Deal: Verizon to Pay $350M Less for Yahoo.) Recode’s sources claimed at the time that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who was at the helm of the internet giant for four years, which featured a prolonged trading downturn, will not be joining Oath. Those challenges, coupled with a reputation for lavish spending and mistimed acquisitions—e.g., paying $1.1 billion for social the blogging platform Tumblr—led many to expect Mayer’s departure. Recode added that Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products at Yahoo, is also likely to get the boot, while communications products head Jeff Bonforte is set to be one of the few executives to stay. Armstrong will soon make the rest of his choices on who stays and who leaves.

Verizon wishes Mayer well in her future endeavors,” the company said in the release.  (See also: Verizon to Lay Off 1,000 Across AOl, Yahoo: Report.)

It’s been a long and winding road for Verizon to close on the deal which was once valued at $4.83 billion but was reduced in the wake of huge data breaches at Yahoo that left the acquisition up in the air for some time. With Yahoo Verizon is a step closer to realizing its vision of becoming an advertising powerhouse that rivals Facebook (FB) and Alphabet’s (GOOG) Google.

Kline,6152017,Fool,6082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have long-dominated the wireless industry by touting the quality of their networks. By emphasizing the point that consumers would have a better experience with their service, the two companies built subscriber bases that were around double the size of third-place T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and fourth-place Sprint (NYSE:S). There was a time when Verizon had a real edge. Verizon has steadily topped all three of its rivals in the twice-a-year RootMetrics report on wireless networks. In recent quarters, however, that advantage has slipped, and OpenSignal, another company that tracks wireless network quality through its State of Mobile Networks Report, showed in February that T-Mobile had caught up to Verizon. ""The LTE speed race between T-Mobile and Verizon has long been a close one, but in our last U.S. report T-Mobile held the edge,"" according to OpenSignal. ""That narrow lead, however, disappeared in our latest round of testings. We measured average LTE download speed on T-Mobile at 16.7 Mbps and on Verizon at 16.9 Mbps, results close enough to produce a statistical tie."" That's bad news for Verizon which has built its wireless business on having the best network. It still may have that, but T-Mobile has clearly closed the gap. T-Mobile and Sprint have both been working feverishly to make that point to consumers. Verizon is being hurt by Sprint ads featuring its former spokesperson. Image source: Sprint. While T-Mobile has been the fastest-growing wireless company, Sprint has been leading the charge against Verizon. The No. 4 carrier has been running ads starring Paul Marcarelli, who for years worked as Verizon's ""Can You Hear Me Now?"" spokesman. In his Sprint ads, Marcarelli makes the point that all networks are good and that it's silly to pay extra for what he calls a 1% difference. T-Mobile hasn't been quiet in going after Verizon, either. CEO John Legere takes credit for forcing Verizon to offer unlimited data plans while also trying to woo its customers with a special offer. ""After desperately launching unlimited, Verizon's network choked -- while our network speeds surged. Today, T-Mobile has a whopping 23% speed advantage over Verizon,"" he said in a press release. ""So to kick off summer, we're going BIG right out of the gate and throwing a lifeline to millions of Verizon customers. Now, you can ditch Verizon, keep your phone, and we'll even pay it off for you!"" Just having to offer unlimited data plans hits Verizon in the pocketbook. The company, along with AT&T, has made billions in overages, with customers buying larger plans than they need to avoid running out of data. Unlimited data ends that. In addition, the company has the further problem that if consumers start believing it doesn't have a superior network, there's no reason for them to pay more for its service. Verizon currently charges $160 for three unlimited lines or $180 for four. That's well more than T-Mobile at $130 for three or $140 for four, and double Sprint's promotional offer of $90 for up up to five lines with unlimited data. These shifting trends explain why T-Mobile has added more than 1 million new customers every quarter for four years. Verizon lost 307,000 retail postpaid customers in Q1. These industry changes put Verizon in a position that will ultimately hurt its profits. The company can either stay the course and keep its prices high, which will lead to subscriber loss, or it can cut prices. Neither situation should warm the hearts of shareholders, who will see a company forced to make less money in its core business one way or the other. ","

Sprint (NYSE:S) really wants you to switch service providers. For a limited time, the fourth-place carrier is offering a free year of its unlimited data plan to customers who switch from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), or AT&T (NYSE:T). Apparently the discounts Sprint was offering on its unlimited plan following the rollout of Verizon's similar plan weren't working well enough to grow subscribers. If Sprint can't add subscribers when it's literally giving away the service, it's got a big problem. To be sure, Sprint's decision may foretell a bad quarter. The promotion notably concludes at the end of June, which coincides with the end of the second quarter. Verizon had similar reasons for launching its unlimited plan. Image source: Sprint. The wireless industry is in the midst of a price war. The average phone plan declined 13% over the past 12 months, and consumers are able to get more data for less regardless of which service provider they use. Verizon's service revenue has come under particular pressure, and its new unlimited plan isn't helping, at least not in the short term. The company suffered a 6.1% year-over-year decline in service revenue in the first quarter, and that trend could accelerate in Q2 with a full quarter of unlimited-plan results. But Sprint's results have been just as bad as Verizon's, if not worse. It's in a race to the bottom, as it's been unable to produce a differentiating factor other than price. Well, it just won that race. While Verizon expects its service revenue to stabilize over the next couple years, Sprint's fall seems to have no end. Of course, Sprint's aggressiveness could put added pressure on Verizon and the other competitors in the market to produce promotions of their own. While it might not show up on the service-revenue line, free phones or other promotions will definitely show up on the bottom line. Sprint isn't heavily promoting its free-service promotion. If a deal is good, you'll hear about it eventually, so management argues that it's saving significant marketing dollars that it can put toward offering the free service. It's just a different way of approaching customer acquisition costs. Sprint is taking a big risk assuming that a significant percentage of customers will stick around after their free service ends. It's been unable to hold on to customers for the long term, sporting the worst churn rate in the industry. These days, wireless carriers are fighting for every last net customer addition they can get. While it's unlikely any of the carriers are as desperate as Sprint, we could see continued promotions from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. All three have offered free devices for new customers and for those who upgrade to higher-priced plans. AT&T has an ongoing promotion for $25 off one of its various television services and free HBO for subscribers to its highest-priced plan. T-Mobile is currently offering a third line free on its unlimited plan. Verizon isn't being as aggressive, as it's apparently seeing decent results with its unlimited plan as is. All this is to say that none of the carriers are completely averse to offering promotional discounts or freebies to entice customers to its service. However, the latest move from Sprint could put further pressure on service revenue or profit margin, or both, at all the major carriers. ","
      
    Sprint Takes the Nuclear Option in the Mobile Price War -- The Motley Fool

738,Adam Levy,6152017,Fool,6082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. U.S. consumers are benefiting from a major price war among wireless carriers after T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) introduced unlimited plans late in 2016 that forced AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to follow suit earlier this year. Overall, prices are down 13% from this time last year with declines of 7% in March and another 1.7% in April, according to Labor Department data. Price declines accelerated in March, following Verizon's entry into the world of unlimited data plans. Verizon still priced its offering above the competition, but many current Verizon subscribers are able to save money each month by switching to the new plan. That move has put pressure on the entire industry. But while average pricing is down, the competition hasn't affected each carrier equally. Here's a breakdown of the postpaid phone pricing trends for each carrier. Data source: Company financial reports. *Includes connected devices as well as phones. The biggest losers over the past year were Sprint and Verizon. Both have seen average revenue per postpaid subscriber decline more than 8%. It's worth noting that Verizon's average-revenue-per-user (ARPU) numbers include connected devices such as tablets, which obfuscates the actual impact of its new phone plan. Still, the overall trend indicates that Verizon's prices are declining faster than the industry average. AT&T also felt some pain, as the average subscriber paid about 2.5% less per month year over year in the first quarter. The company is seeing a lot of subscribers migrate to their employers' lower-priced business plans while losing lower-value subscribers to T-Mobile, Sprint, and prepaid options. T-Mobile, meanwhile, managed to increase its pricing. It was, however, operating from a place of weakness. The company had by far the lowest average revenue per subscriber last year, and it only just surpassed Sprint's ARPU in the first quarter. Since the Labor Department data says the biggest drop in pricing came in March and continued in April, it's likely ARPU will fall further for most carriers in the second quarter. Verizon has said it expects its numbers to keep falling but that they should level out in the latter half of the year. The company also expects to grab a larger share of gross additions, many of which will go for its higher-priced unlimited plan versus a traditional data bucket. That trend should help offset the pain from customers that lower their bills by switching to unlimited. Image source: Verizon. Sprint, meanwhile, might see some relief after retiring its ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion and changing its unlimited family plan pricing. After Verizon went unlimited, Sprint started offering five lines for $90 per month. Its new offer is four lines for $120 per month, a significant increase but still below competitors' pricing. T-Mobile may face some pricing pressure after a move to include taxes and fees in its advertised price for its unlimited plan. It also promised not to increase customers' bills unless they change plans. But now that its new unlimited plan is the only option for new T-Mobile subscribers, the influx of gross additions should offset smaller customer bills. AT&T could continue to experience declines, but it's heavily pushing its top-tier unlimited plan with promotions such as free HBO. That's the kind of thing that can boost service revenue, but it comes at the expense of profit margin. T-Mobile is one of the biggest instigators of the current price war. It has the most to gain, as its pricing remains well below the competition. Its unlimited plan is still less expensive than those of AT&T and Verizon, but it's managing to close the gap in average pricing as the only carrier growing ARPU. At the same time, T-Mobile is adding millions of new subscribers. So not only is it making more revenue per user, but it also has more of them. Clearly, T-Mobile is a big winner. Verizon and AT&T have been the biggest donors of subscribers to T-Mobile. Both have also seen significant pricing pressure, but AT&T doesn't appear to be turning things around at all, while Verizon's unlimited plan saved it from posting an even worse first quarter than it did. What's more, the trends indicate that Verizon will post strong net additions in the second quarter, while AT&T will continue to struggle. Sprint, meanwhile, appears to only have one competitive advantage: price. It's pricing its service much lower than the competition, and then hoping customers will stick around when it raises their bill. That's an unsustainable advantage, and it will lose customers to carriers with stronger networks and better service. Let's not forget the American consumer -- another big winner in the ongoing wireless price war. ","
      
    The Cost of Wireless Service Is Plummeting as Price War Rages On -- The Motley Fool

Ah, retirement. The golden years. This is the time to be catching up on your reading, playing with your grandkids, maybe seeing the world a bit -- but definitely not a time to be worrying about whether your stock portfolio will crash. To help you accomplish the former things, and avoid the latter, I've screened for stocks offering four attributes that should appeal to retirees -- and really, anyone looking to own a safe stock. We're looking for companies that: The following are three stocks that appear well suited for investors in retirement. Go ahead -- read on and give them a look, and see if you agree. Image source: Getty Images. Once upon a time, Gap (NYSE:GPS) was the hottest name in mall clothing -- and Old Navy was just its younger, downmarket brother. But my, how times have changed. Today, it's Old Navy that's driving growth at the company. Old Navy's same-store sales surged 8% last quarter, while sales sagged at Gap and Banana Republic. Still, Gap CEO Art Peck has high hopes to replicate his success with  Old Navy and turn around sales at Gap's other brands. Already, gross margin is on the upswing at all three of Gap's main brands. As if all this good business news weren't enough to persuade an investor to buy this brand-name stock, Gap also boasts a lot of numbers that should prove attractive to investors in retirement. It has a low beta of just 0.87, for one thing, indicating that historically, at least, its stock has been a bit less volatile than most others. Gap's 4% dividend yield also offers a nice income stream to folks on a fixed income -- and Gap has raised its dividend six times in the past seven years. Perhaps best of all, at just 13.2 times earnings, Gap stock is cheap, costing barely half the average 25.7 P/E on the S&P 500 today. Willing to pay a bit more to get an even bigger dividend? Looking for a business a bit less subject to the whims of fashion than retail clothing? Look no further than Total (NYSE:TOT). Zack's Equity Research recently highlighted Total as offering ""one of the best production growth profiles among the oil super majors,"" with oil production set to grow 4% year over year in 2017 -- plus any growth the company might expect to enjoy from rising oil prices, as OPEC tightens the tap. Perhaps the most encouraging fact for folks looking for a stock to invest in during retirement, though, is this: In MTS's last earnings report -- which showed subscribers growing and free cash flow up 11% -- MTS CEO Andrei Dubovskov named dividends as one of the three cornerstones of MTS's ""3D"" business model, saying the company is focused on delivering ""data, digital, and dividends."" With a dividend yield north of 10%, it seems to be doing a pretty good job of doing that. ","

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to investing in dividend-paying stocks, sometimes bigger is better. Any company that can afford to spend billions on dividend payments each year must have a solid business model. Otherwise, it would never promise to share so much wealth with its shareholders. So which companies are the biggest dividend payers on the market today? Here's a closer look at eight companies that have spent at least $8 billion on dividend payments over the past year. Image source: Apple. Sporting a market cap of around $765 billion, tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become one of the world's largest publicly traded companies. Long-term shareholders can credit the company's phenomenal run to the tremendous popularity of the iPhone, while other products such as the iPad, Apple TV, the Apple Watch, and Mac computers, have helped round out the company's ecosystem. Over the past four quarters, Apple's suite of products has cranked out more than $45 billion in total profits. With so much cash coming in, Apple's management team has made a commitment to return a huge amount of its excess capital to shareholders. Part of that plan calls for regular dividend payments, and over the past 12 months, Apple has put more than $12 billion directly into shareholders' pockets. While Apple's 1.7% yield might not seem all that high, that $12 billion makes Apple the largest dividend payer on this list. Image source: Getty Images. The enormous plunge in oil and gas prices has hit every energy company hard over the past few years. That includes energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), as the integrated oil company's financial statements are sensitive to big commodity price swings. From peak to trough, Chevron's revenue plunged nearly 50% through the downturn, while profits fell even harder. Despite the pain, Chevron remained committed to paying out its strong dividend. That's quite an accomplishment, as its total dividend payments of more than $8 billion have dwarfed the company's net income of $2.9 billion over the past four quarters. Chevron has largely relied on asset sales to help fund the difference between the two numbers. The company's recent results are starting to paint a rosier picture. Production and energy prices are climbing, while costs are on the decline. If this trend holds up, then Chevron's profitability should start to bounce back. John Flannery was recently named chairman and CEO of General Electric. Image source: General Electric. General Electric (NYSE:GE) has reinvented itself several times since its founding more than a century ago. In recent years, GE has been focused on returning to its industrial roots and has been selling off a variety of business units. Investors also recently learned that longtime CEO Jeff Immelt is stepping aside and being replaced by industry veteran John Flannery to keep the transition going. In spite of all of the changes, GE has remained committed to using its huge financial resources to reward its shareholders. Over the past 12 months, GE has spent more than $8.5 billion on dividend payments. At current prices, GE's stock yields more than 3.4%. If Flannery's changes can get the company's profit engine humming, then shareholders should be able to expect ever more dividend bumps in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been an acquisition machine for decades and now counts more than 250 operating companies in its empire. Its companies sell products in three broad product categories: consumer products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. While all three divisions churn out predictable profits, the company is counting on its pharmaceutical division to deliver revenue and profit growth over the next few years. One big benefit of selling healthcare products is that demand tends to be very stable. That has afforded Johnson & Johnson will the luxury of being able to pass along regular price increases and provide its shareholders with regular dividend bumps. In fact, J&J has grown its dividend for 54 years in a row. Over the past year, J&J has paid out more than $8.6 billion in dividends to its investors, which gives its stock a yield of more than 2.5%. That's impressive, but since its dividend payment consumes only about half of net income, there appears to be plenty of room left for dividend increases down the road. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was slow to embrace the cloud-computing revolution, but all of that changed when CEO Satya Nadella took the reins in 2014. The company has since invested aggressively to move its iconic Office suite of products into the cloud. In addition, Microsoft's Azure web-services platform is growing quickly and currently holds the second-place spot behind Amazon.com. When combined with the success of its Surface products, Mr. Softy's profits have trended in the right direction over the past few years. With a growing pile of profits, Microsoft has used its ample cash hoard to reward shareholders with regular dividend increases. Over the past year, Microsoft has spent more than $11.6 billion on its dividend payments, and that generous payout represents only about two-thirds of the company's $17.8 billion in total net income. With profits expected to increase as the company's move to the cloud continues to takes hold, investors should be able to expect more dividend bumps from here. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T (NYSE:T) has enjoyed surging demand for wireless data as consumers have raced to get their hands on the largest and greatest smartphone. However, the market now appears to be saturated, and wireless prices are falling, so the company is looking for a new avenue to drive profit growth from here. That's why the company is pushing hard to complete its $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner. If the deal goes through, the company will be far more diversified and should have an easier time retaining customers by offering more attractive packaged deals. AT&T's investors should have their fingers crossed that the deal goes through, since the company's payout ratio is getting uncomfortably high. In the past year, AT&T has spent more than $11.7 billion on dividend payments, which is awfully close to the $12.5 billion in net income the company pulled in. While AT&T's 5% dividend yield is enticing, there isn't a whole lot of wiggle room should profits take a dip. That could happen if regulators choose to block the Time Warner transaction and wireless prices continue to fall. And that could put the company's 32-year-long history of consecutive dividend increases in jeopardy. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil is another energy giant that's been a bankable long-term investment. The company has paid out a growing dividend for 35 consecutive years, which includes its recent 2.7% bump earlier this year. Exxon's enviable track record has been driven by its management team's knack for using capital effectively. The company places an emphasis on funding projects that have high returns on capital, which helped to keep its profit engine humming throughout the recent downturn. Over the past year, Exxon has churned out more than $10 billion in net income, which is impressive given the energy slump. While that wasn't enough to fully cover the $12.7 billion spent on dividends, Exxon's profits are on the upswing thanks to cost-cutting measures and stronger commodity prices. With plenty of growth projects waiting in the wings, it might not be long before ExxonMobil's earnings fully cover the 3.7% dividend yield. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is another dominant telecommunications giant that cranks out huge amounts of profits each year. While the company is also experiencing pricing pressure in the wireless space, the company's recent move to offer unlimited data is helping keep its customers loyal. Like AT&T, Verizon has gone on a spending spree as of late, as a way to drive future profit growth. The company recently bought out both AOL and Yahoo! in an effort to build out its digital advertising business. Verizon has increased its dividend each year for more than a decade and currently offers a 5% yield. Over the past year, its dividend has consumed $9.2 billion, but that's only about 75% of the $12.2 billion in net income it pulled in. If the company's big bets on digital advertising pay off, the company's streak of dividend increases shoulnd be able to continue from here. ","

Comey’s testimony is part of a litany of potentially market-moving events playing out over the next 24 hours, including an earlier decision by the European Central Bank to keep its monetary policy unchanged and a U.K. snap election. However, Wall Street investors have signaled that events don’t appear to threaten the stock market’s extended push into record territory, which has been driven by President Donald Trump’s promises of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. Comey’s statement, released Wednesday, suggested he was worried Trump had sought to secure his “loyalty” and wanted him to help “lift the cloud” from the investigation into possible Russian interference in the U.S. election was casting. Comey also confirmed the president’s assertion that the director had repeatedly assured Trump that the Federal Bureau of Investigation hadn’t opened an investigation into him. He reiterated those assertions during his testimony in front of the Senate panel. Engelke, meanwhile, believes that the House passage of legislation to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill is likely to accelerate circulation of capital in the markets and boost economic activity. Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, said absent any surprises, recent events suggests that the stock market should drift higher. “Ultimately, stock markets are going to reflect earnings,” he said. Orlando said the U.S. and Europe are showing strong quarterly results that may help to support gains in stocks that some strategists and investors view as overvalued. Earlier in the day, the ECB, as expected, left interest rates unchanged but said it continued to expect interest rates “to remain at present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon” of its asset-buying program, which is set to run at least through December. In previous statements, the ECB had said it expected rates “to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.” Check out: A recap of the ECB’s Mario Draghi news conference Read: Why the ECB can take only ‘baby steps’ toward ending ultraloose monetary policy Beyond the ECB and Comey, investors also were focused on the U.K. general election, In the U.K., voters headed to the polls in an election that turned out to be much more uncertain than predicted. Opinion polls are still giving Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party the lead, but the big question is whether the party will increase its majority in parliament. Polling stations close at 10 p.m. London time, or 5 p.m. Eastern, and the first exit polls will be released soon after.

To add insult to injury, analysts at Macquarie Research downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform on Thursday. “Time’s rejection of unsolicited offers for the company in late April puts the heat on the company to even more rapidly enact a turnaround,” lead analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients. “Time will now be pruning select magazine titles to raise cash and de-risk from this large portion of their revenue base, which should enable them to launch more digital-only brands.” Don’t miss:  Time Inc. to cut 300 jobs in shift to digital Time’s declines in print circulation and advertising are accelerating, Nollen said, and at the moment the company is struggling to offset those declines with growth in online video. The company, which owns such magazine brands as namesake Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Fortune, hopes the cuts it announced will help streamline the business and allow it focus on digital and video opportunities. Time Inc. made sure to make a big display of its digital and video potential during its Newfront in May and showcased its new and upcoming projects to a ballroom full of potential advertisers. But right now print still makes up about 70% of Time’s revenue, and in the first quarter print ad revenue declined 21%. In the company’s first-quarter earnings release it said its 8% decline in overall revenue reflected the declines in print, advertising and circulation revenues. And it likely won’t get any better in the second quarter with Manga Global forecasting that magazine advertising will continue to drop as much as 25% year-over-year by 2021.

Oath’s more than 50 brands include HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr. The expenses are related to severance payments, acquisition and integration costs, Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless operator, said in a regulatory filing. bit.ly/2sDnZv7 Reuters reported last week that Verizon planned to cut about 2,000 jobs or 15 percent of the 14,000 employees at its Yahoo and AOL businesses. Verizon also said it expected to save over $1 billion in operating costs through 2020 as a result of the Yahoo deal, which closed on Tuesday.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. - It's been several years since I've Yahoo'd. How about you? This week Yahoo, one of the oldest Internet brands, became part of the Verizon empire, one of the companies (along with HuffPost, AOL and TechCrunch) that live within the newly created Oath unit, which hopes to compete against Google and Facebook as a bulked-up alternative for online advertisers. Good luck, Oath. And let's take a quick minute and look at the jewel of Oath, the beleaguered and ignored Yahoo.com. If any website sorely needed a fresh coat of paint and new outlook, it's Yahoo. Going to the Yahoo.com page is like going back in time to the days of MySpace and AOL, sites that were littered with gossip, celebrity news and really cheap ads for infomercial products. And what did we see on Yahoo's front page this week? Trending stories about the late singer Whitney Houston, former pop queen Britney Spears and even country icon Dolly Parton; ads for cheap credit card and mortgage rates and cruise deals, along with articles about cute pets, Apple and Samsung smartphones and Donald Trump. (The handful of concessions to current times.) ""There's just too much going on,"" Samantha Stonich, a tourist from Florida visiting Manhattan Beach, Calif. told us this week. ""I don't use Yahoo at all. It's outdated."" (Watch Stonich talking to us about Yahoo in this video here.) Yahoo, which started in 1994 as a pre-Google search engine, and morphed into a ""portal"" for reading e-mail, keeping up on news, weather and sports, has also been the victim of some bad breaks. Beyond the corporate missteps that thwarted former CEO Marissa Mayer in her efforts to revitalize the brand, there were those two nasty e-mail breaches. Yahoo said that some 1.5 billion e-mail accounts were hacked in separate attacks in 2013 and 2014. There are more than one billion reasons to have stopped using Yahoo. Yet Yahoo is still a top Internet destination-No. 3 in the United States, with 192 million visitors in April, according to comScore. Google is No. 1 with 241 million, and Facebook No. 2 with just over 200 million.  Beyond the Yahoo front page, which is still used heavily for search, the company's top portals include sites for e-mail (despite the breach), stocks and sports. ""I love my fantasy football,"" said Eric Feng, the founder of the new Unboxed.TV app, on our Thursday #TalkingTech Live episode on Facebook. ""For several months a year, I'm at Yahoo all the time."" Oath also owns AOL, which actually pre-dates Yahoo. Today's AOL looks more modern, less cluttered and less littered with bottom of the barrel ads than Yahoo. But it's a long ways from the intoxicating feel of the Facebook News Feed. That basic Yahoo formula-news you cared about and tools to communicate with friends, got updated by Facebook, which turned it into a personalized social network that is now one of the most powerful Internet companies today, worth $434 billion according to…..Yahoo! What would it take for #TalkingTech to return to Yahoo? Throwing money at faded TV stars like Katie Couric didn't do it. But as a news junkie, if I could get links to all the relevant content that interests me, with higher quality, personalized ads, there's no reason I wouldn't come back. You? Analysts say it's doubtful Yahoo can ever become what it once was-the dominant online home for news and communication, but stranger things have happened. Remember when Apple was left for almost dead before Steve Jobs returned, and revived the company with the iPod? Now it's the world's most valuable company, worth nearly $1 trillion. And that would make anyone want to say Yahoo! Our adventures with Yahoo - the #TalkingTech podcast. Click here to listen. Uber -The ride-hailing company had quite the week. CEO Travis Kalanick announced he was taking an indefinite leave, in the wake of an internal investigation into Uber's culture and governance that was sparked by claims of pervasive sexism and questionable corporate practices. Executive vice-president Emil Michael resigned, as did David Bonderman, a member of the Uber board of directors, who quit the board after making a sexist remark at the company's all-hands meeting. Uber has been suffering from management woes all year, and this week it released the results of an investigation by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, whose firm Covington & Burling was engaged by Uber in February after former engineer Susan Fowler wrote a damning blog post about the company's sexist, aggressive and biased culture. Snap - Talk about disappearing profits. The stock of Snap, Inc., the parent company of the messaging app Snapchat, fell to its initial $17 IPO price, as investors worried about Snap's business prospects. It's been a rough ride for Snap, which began the year as the biggest IPO in years, had two great initial days of trading, starting at $24 a share, only to see prices fall most days since. Google Backup- The Internet giant has a new way to keep all those files on our computers backed up, with a new automatic backup plan. The update, which will go live on June 28, will allow consumer users of Drive to back up full folders of their computer to the cloud. This means that instead of putting individual files or photos from your computer's Desktop folder into the Google Drive folder, you can automatically have Google Drive back up the entire Desktop folder and everything within it.  But consumer beware-the service isn't free. Google offers 15 GB of free space, but additional storage will cost you, starting at $99 yearly for 1 TB of space. Most desktops come with 1 TB of space, while laptops are in the 250GB to 500 GB range, so if you do more than just send e-mail and write documents, this backup will cost considerably more than the one-time purchase of a $100 TB hard drive. Amazon/Whole Foods - Even if you didn't shop there, no story was bigger this week than e-tailer giant Amazon's $13.7 billion foray into national, brick and mortar retailing, with a bid to acquire Whole Foods. The possibilities are endless. You could imagine paying for goods without going through the cash register (a concept currently being tested in Seattle), dedicated areas within the store for lounging and shopping on Amazon, home delivery as part of your Prime subscription. ""Amazon brings capacities that were not in-house for Whole Foods, such as delivery,"" Darren Seifer, an analyst with NPD Group told USA TODAY.

750, ,6222017,Reuters,6152017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday faulted the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s apparent “indifference” toward how to distribute money left over from its 2015 settlement with Sprint Corp over unauthorized customer charges. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan nonetheless rejected a request by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas and Vermont to send $15.1 million remaining from the $50 million accord to two state-based projects, saying the money should go to the U.S. Treasury. The decision raised the question of whether the CFPB, whose September accord with Wells Fargo & Co over unauthorized customer accounts sparked a national scandal, was inattentive toward enforcing one of its own settlements, at a time that some Republican lawmakers hope to strip some of the agency’s power. Sprint had agreed in May 2015 to refund $50 million to customers subjected to the “cramming” of charges onto their wireless bills, following similar settlements by AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. But a plan to send the leftover $15.1 million to the Treasury was put on hold when the states proposed their alternative in January. Pauley said the CFPB maintained a “conspicuous silence” on the proposal until May 10, when it responded to an order he issued a month earlier with a short, “gossamer” memo “modifying its previous position of indifference to one of steadfast opposition.” Ultimately, Pauley sided with the CFPB, but said its delay kept the money out of Treasury’s hands for six months. The CFPB’s role as a public watchdog “extends to properly disposing of all funds secured through the resolution of an enforcement action even after the underlying fraud has dissipated and the victims have been made whole,” Pauley wrote. “Until this court issued its April 10 order, the CFPB appeared uninterested in the fate of the unexpended funds,” he added. “It leads this court to ask who will guard the guardians.” The CFPB declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said his office, which handled legal filings in the case, was reviewing the decision. In court papers, Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint said it would defer to Pauley’s decision. Pauley has criticized government agencies before, including in 2009 when he faulted the Securities and Exchange Commission over a settlement involving biased Wall Street research. The case is Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v Sprint Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09931. ","

751, ,6222017,Reuters,6152017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders. The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump’s effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the government’s computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week. “We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs,” Trump told the executives on Thursday. “We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.” In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc. Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

752, ,6222017,Reuters,6152017,"(Reuters) - More than two dozen U.S. companies, including several big banks, have teamed up to establish shared principles that would allow them to better understand their cyber security ratings and to challenge them if necessary, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday.    Large corporations often use the ratings, the cyber equivalent of a FICO credit score, to assess how prepared the companies they work with are to withstand cyber attacks. Insurers also look at the ratings when they make underwriting decisions on cyber liability. The move comes in response to the emergence of such startups as BitSight Technologies, RiskRecon and SecurityScorecard that collect and analyze large swaths of data to rate companies on cyber security. As these startups have gained prominence and venture capital funding, the companies they rate have complained of a lack of transparency. “The challenge is that their (startups’) methodologies are proprietary and there hasn’t been transparency on how they go about creating the ratings,” JPMorgan Global Chief Information Security Officer Rohan Amin said in an interview. Ratings issued by those companies could help guide the standards being set by U.S. corporations. BitSight, for example, rates companies on a scale of 250 to 900 with a higher rating indicating better security performance. “For organizations to use your platform you have to demonstrate trustworthiness and reliability,” said Jake Olcott, BitSight’s vice president of strategic partnerships.

I bought shares of Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) in April 2016, and since then the stock has gone up and come right back down. If you include dividends, I'm about even on my investment. I'm holding onto my shares, expecting a return to strong earnings growth in the long term, with a steadily rising dividend to boot. Still, there's a good bear case to be made as Verizon confronts fierce competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Sprint (NYSE:S). Here are the challenges I see facing Verizon, and how they could negatively impact the company in a manner worse than I originally anticipated. Image source: Verizon. Verizon has faced pricing pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint for several years now. That pressure is getting worse as T-Mobile's network continues to improve. T-Mobile boasts that its network will soon offer coverage on par with Verizon's after it's able to deploy the low-band spectrum it won at auction earlier this year. With an unlimited plan priced below Verizon's, T-Mobile presents great value to consumers. The introduction of unlimited plans by T-Mobile and Sprint last fall prompted Verizon to launch its own unlimited plan, as it faced tons of customer losses. While the new plan has helped Verizon keep customers in place, it's also having a negative impact on its service revenue. The first switchers to come on board with unlimited are those that stand to save money by switching. Management says it expects the pressure on its service revenue to mitigate by the second half of the year. But the competition keeps launching salvos. Most recently, Sprint started offering a free year of its unlimited data plan to customers that switch from one of the other three major wireless carriers. The promotion specifically targets Verizon customers, with more eligible devices for customers switching from Verizon than AT&T or T-Mobile. This price war can't go on forever, can it? Many analysts expect Sprint and T-Mobile will either merge or one or both will get acquired. Either situation would theoretically reduce pricing pressure as the businesses start to focus on cash flow instead of customer acquisition at any cost. But Sprint's recent promotion (free service for a year) makes it hard for Sprint and T-Mobile to plead a case to the FCC that the current state of competitive intensity is unsustainable without the scale of a combined Sprint and T-Mobile. While both are reportedly in talks with one another to merge, a lack of a merger means we could see the fierce competitive environment continue on indefinitely. That would put pressure on Verizon's pricing and its ability to attract subscribers. Image source: Comcast. Both Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) are entering the wireless market with their own MVNO services. Ironically, both are relying on a pre-established agreement with Verizon to use its network wholesale. Comcast's Xfinity Mobile product indicates it's mostly looking to use mobile as a way to reduce churn of its video and internet subscribers. Charter will likely adopt a similar strategy, and it's agreed to work in partnership with Comcast to develop best practices and work on research and development. But as more people cut the cord, Comcast and Charter could become more competitive in wireless. While Verizon is in a better position than its competitors considering its network is underlying Charter's and Comcast's, it would still effectively be trading retail customers for lower-value wholesale customers. What's more, Comcast has expressed interest in launching its own wireless network, having purchased some 600 MHz spectrum at auction earlier this year. That could be the first of several moves that allows Comcast to ditch Verizon and go whole-hog in wireless down the road. My investment thesis for Verizon is that it has the brand and network strength to survive the current competitive environment. More importantly, the current competitive environment is unsustainable, as T-Mobile and Sprint will eventually feel pressure from shareholders or potential acquirers to generate meaningful cash flow. However, it seems like every month there's a new promotion that continues to escalate the pressure on Verizon. Verizon's switch to an unlimited plan is paying off for now, with improved trends in the number of subscribers it's losing to competitors. But it's coming at the cost of its average revenue per subscriber. As T-Mobile's network continues to improve, and both it and Sprint make increasingly aggressive offers to attract subscribers, it may not be long before Verizon has to take further steps or risk losing subscribers again. Either way, it's bad news for Verizon shareholders. Without a significant change in the status of the wireless industry -- an acquisition, merger, or complete financial breakdown -- Verizon could see a continuation of the current downward trend in earnings and revenue. The longer it goes on like this, the worse it gets for Verizon, and the bigger the hole it has to climb out of when competition eventually eases (if it ever does). ","
      
    Verizon Communications: The Bear Case From a Bull -- The Motley Fool

Sprint (NYSE:S) really wants you to switch service providers. For a limited time, the fourth-place carrier is offering a free year of its unlimited data plan to customers who switch from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), or AT&T (NYSE:T). Apparently the discounts Sprint was offering on its unlimited plan following the rollout of Verizon's similar plan weren't working well enough to grow subscribers. If Sprint can't add subscribers when it's literally giving away the service, it's got a big problem. To be sure, Sprint's decision may foretell a bad quarter. The promotion notably concludes at the end of June, which coincides with the end of the second quarter. Verizon had similar reasons for launching its unlimited plan. Image source: Sprint. The wireless industry is in the midst of a price war. The average phone plan declined 13% over the past 12 months, and consumers are able to get more data for less regardless of which service provider they use. Verizon's service revenue has come under particular pressure, and its new unlimited plan isn't helping, at least not in the short term. The company suffered a 6.1% year-over-year decline in service revenue in the first quarter, and that trend could accelerate in Q2 with a full quarter of unlimited-plan results. But Sprint's results have been just as bad as Verizon's, if not worse. It's in a race to the bottom, as it's been unable to produce a differentiating factor other than price. Well, it just won that race. While Verizon expects its service revenue to stabilize over the next couple years, Sprint's fall seems to have no end. Of course, Sprint's aggressiveness could put added pressure on Verizon and the other competitors in the market to produce promotions of their own. While it might not show up on the service-revenue line, free phones or other promotions will definitely show up on the bottom line. Sprint isn't heavily promoting its free-service promotion. If a deal is good, you'll hear about it eventually, so management argues that it's saving significant marketing dollars that it can put toward offering the free service. It's just a different way of approaching customer acquisition costs. Sprint is taking a big risk assuming that a significant percentage of customers will stick around after their free service ends. It's been unable to hold on to customers for the long term, sporting the worst churn rate in the industry. These days, wireless carriers are fighting for every last net customer addition they can get. While it's unlikely any of the carriers are as desperate as Sprint, we could see continued promotions from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. All three have offered free devices for new customers and for those who upgrade to higher-priced plans. AT&T has an ongoing promotion for $25 off one of its various television services and free HBO for subscribers to its highest-priced plan. T-Mobile is currently offering a third line free on its unlimited plan. Verizon isn't being as aggressive, as it's apparently seeing decent results with its unlimited plan as is. All this is to say that none of the carriers are completely averse to offering promotional discounts or freebies to entice customers to its service. However, the latest move from Sprint could put further pressure on service revenue or profit margin, or both, at all the major carriers. ","

761,Anders Bylund,6222017,Fool,6152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend investors are well aware that Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) offers one of the richest yields on the market today. In fact, Frontier's 12.6% dividend yield is the most generous payout among the members of the S&P 500 market index -- by a wide margin. Runner-up and fellow regional telecom CenturyLink's (NYSE:CTL) yield stops at just 8%. But bigger isn't always better. Extremely high dividend yields are often a sign of financial trouble. I'm afraid that Frontier falls in this category, and that its lofty dividend payouts are headed for an abrupt end. Image source: Getty Images. The dividend crash actually started long ago. Frontier's quarterly payouts stood at $0.25 per share between 2004 and 2010, when the dividend cuts started. At that level, the yield would have been roughly 75% today as Frontier's share prices marched downward over the years. It would also have amounted to an annual dividend budget of $1.2 billion -- more than four times last year's $265 million of free cash flows. That is not a sustainable policy by any leap of the imagination, so the company had no choice but to slow the payments down over the years. So the annual dividend payouts added up to $1 per share in early 2010, dropped to $0.75 per share for the next two years, rested at $0.40 per share until 2015, where they perked up to $0.42 per share. Last month, the quarterly check was slashed to just $0.04 per share for a forward-looking annual sum of $0.16 per share. The yield topped out at 35% in mid-May but crashed down as the effective date of the lowered dividend rolled around. So here we stand, with Frontier dividends yielding less than 13% on an annual basis. Management says that the cash is better used to pay down and refinance debt balances, so you shouldn't expect dividend boosts anytime soon. I would actually worry more about further cuts. Frontier's buyouts of landline operations from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have reshaped the smaller company in many ways. Network assets tripled in the 2010 transaction covering Verizon landlines in 14 states, then nearly doubled again with the deal for operations in Texas, Florida, and California in 2015-2016. But Frontier's long-term debt balances followed a very similar path and now stand at a crushing total of $17.9 billion versus cash equivalents of just $341 million. Meanwhile, Frontier's share count rose from 315 million to 1.2 billion stubs. A lot of Frontier's dividend payments are effectively going out to Verizon investors, so slashing the payments kind of lowers the long-term price of those transactions. Together, these two effects have put a serious damper on Frontier's dividend policies. But wait, there's more. The Verizon deals have indeed boosted Frontier's top-line revenue and EBITDA profits dramatically, but free cash flows have held steady. Again, higher share counts plus steady cash flows equals pressure on the company's dividend payments. Boosting the payouts under these circumstances would require more debt or additional share sales just to finance the dividend policy. Dividend cuts, on the other hand, make a ton of sense. FTR Dividend data by YCharts. Generous dividends have failed to make up for Frontier's plunging share price. Investors buying into the Verizon promise in the summer of 2010 have seen their holdings shrink by 83% in seven years. The damage is limited to 67% if dividends were reinvested along the way, but it's still a strongly negative return. If you bought Frontier shares just before the Verizon agreement in February of 2015, the damage would be 81% in plain share price terms, or 76% when accounting for dividend effects. Management keeps a stiff upper lip and is once again promising good things in the far future. I don't believe a word of that, and expect the dividend payments to keep falling in the years to come. This story does not have a happy ending. Stay away from Frontier's extreme dividend yield. You can find much better dividend stocks for the long term elsewhere.

The growing cord-cutting trend looms large over the pay-TV industry. In fact, the shift to more internet streaming services has led some major pay-TV providers such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) to meet consumers where they are with a linear TV streaming service of their own. But one cable giant has yet to enter the streaming market. It hasn't had to, as it's actually been adding subscribers over the last couple of years. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), the nation's largest cable provider, has done an excellent job holding on to its customers recently, so investors have no reason to be nervous. Image source: Comcast. Comcast lost video subscribers for years after AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) started building out their IPTV infrastructure and promoting their new video services. The heavy promotions stopped a couple of years ago as AT&T and Verizon shifted their focuses and cord-cutting started impacting results; that's when Comcast started to win back customers. Now Comcast has a new brand of competition to deal with. Over-the-top services such as Sling TV and DIRECTV NOW are able to offer their services nationwide. Unlike traditional pay-TV competitors, over-the-top services don't require any physical infrastructure. Dish and AT&T have already launched their services. Hulu has a service in beta, and YouTube TV is coming soon. Verizon says it expects to launch its own service by the end of the year, and several other television streaming services exist as well. All told, the influx of competition is at a level unlike anything Comcast has ever seen before. Nonetheless, people -- for the most part -- have been slow to switch. Sling TV reportedly has 1.3 million subscribers. Its competitors have considerably fewer, and DIRECTV NOW is already having trouble holding on to its early signups. So far, the competition hasn't had a major impact on Comcast, but that doesn't mean it couldn't. In any event, Comcast is well-positioned should it start seeing subscriber losses again. Comcast isn't interested in launching a nationwide television-streaming platform like AT&T's, Verizon's, or Dish's. Nor should it be, as long as its traditional video service continues to perform well and generate loads of revenue. That said, Comcast is in a position such that it could quickly put together a nationwide streaming service of its own, should it decide to go that route. Earlier this year, the company exercised an option to obtain the streaming rights to several cable networks. While it doesn't include every network it would need to launch a successful over-the-top service, it's a good start -- and it cost Comcast nothing. Meanwhile, Comcast is in the midst of renegotiating deals with several major media companies, and nationwide streaming rights are likely to be a point of discussion. Media companies are desperate to increase their affiliate fee per subscriber as more people cut the cord, and throwing in additional perks like on-demand and streaming rights is one way to boost revenue. While it may cost Comcast a little more to buy the extra rights, it can use additional on-demand rights in its popular X1 platform -- which it credits for its reduced churn rate lately. It's also been able to increase its rates, although at a slower pace than programming costs. Consider it insurance in case the competition starts cutting into subscriber growth again. Furthermore, now that Comcast has its own wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, through its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon, it could market a nationwide bundle of mobile phone and television service. The move wouldn't have the same economic advantages as selling Xfinity Mobile into its existing territory, but it would give the company equal footing against Verizon and AT&T. For now, Comcast continues to perform well, slowly adding back subscribers, while its competitors look for growth anywhere they can get it. It's also well-positioned for a potential nationwide expansion. Indeed, Comcast shareholders have nothing to worry about. ","

Following Verizon's acquisition of core Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) assets, the remaining entity has changed its name to Altaba, effective June 16. That company is worth far more than the $4.5 billion Verizon paid in its deal -- as of this writing, Altaba boasts a market cap of approximately $50 billion. Last week, the company registered itself with the SEC as a ""non-diversified, closed-end management investment company."" In other words, Altaba is left overseeing the remaining patent portfolio and other investments, including stakes in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Yahoo! Japan, and a small position in Snap, among others. Here's what investors need to know about Altaba. Alibaba is Altaba's biggest investment. Image source: Alibaba. Altaba owns a 15% stake in Alibaba, which is valued at $341 billion as of this writing, making the investment worth over $51 billion. The 35.5% stake in Yahoo! Japan is worth about $8.5 billion., and the company also has around $11.5 billion in cash and just $1.3 billion in debt. By comparison, the 4.6 million shares of Snap, worth another $80 million or so, are just a blip in the portfolio. Nonetheless, Snap is one of its more noteworthy investments, which really helps exemplify how ""undiversified"" Altaba is as a holding company. Regardless, Altaba is still worth less than the sum of its parts. One of the big reasons for selling off the Yahoo! assets was to help unlock the value of its strategic investments. CEO Thomas McInerny is tasked with growing the portfolio, but he has one major task to deal with in the near term. Everything is great when you invest $1 billion in a company valued at $2.5 billion, and the company proceeds to grow more than 100-fold over the next decade. The problem comes when you want to harvest your investment. In this case, Altaba estimates it would have to pay $15 billion in taxes for an outright sale of its assets. McInerny's top task will be to reduce the that tax liability through strategic divestments of its holdings. It appears most investors are pricing in the likelihood of a 36.5% tax burden on any sale proceeds. That's the estimated effective tax rate Yahoo! cited in its regulatory filings. But if McInerny can reduce the tax burden, or regulations change, Altaba could be a discount means of investing in Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan, and the rest of Altaba's portfolio. Given the vast majority of Altaba's value comes from its Alibaba stake, investors may be better off just investing directly in the latter. For one, it allows you to exercise much more control, without the uncertainty surrounding Altaba. Nor do you have to worry about Yahoo! Japan and the patent portfolio. ","

Kline,6222017,Fool,6152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) have taken quite the beating recently. The company's stock has steadily moved in the wrong direction since it became clear that its purchase of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireline business in California, Texas, and Florida (CTF) would not unlock a smooth path to growth. That $10.54 billion acquisition more than doubled the size of the company, adding approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 2.1 million broadband customers, and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers. That was supposed to give Frontier the scale it needed to operate efficiently -- and in fact, that aspect of the Verizon purchase worked out. What it hasn't given the company is further growth. Frontier has lost some of the customers it paid for in all four quarters since the CTF deal closed. CEO Daniel McCarthy has remained upbeat through the entire process. Even though his company has had to cut its dividend, and plans a reverse stock split, he has focused on the light at the end of the tunnel. He shared his thoughts on what's next for the struggling company during its Q1 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required). The biggest challenge for Frontier has been holding onto customers. Image source: Getty Images. As noted above, one of the main goals of buying the Verizon assets was to create a more cost effective operation. That has happened, and the company expects it can even exceed its goals in this regard. ""We're pleased to have met our target of realizing $1.25 billion in annualized synergies,"" said McCarthy, and the company expects to achieve another incremental $350 million in annual savings by mid-year 2018. While saving money buys the company more time, it does not address the underlying issue of subscriber cancellations. The CEO addressed that as well, noting that trends have improved in that area for the last two quarters (though they have not turned positive). ""Our focus now is on improving our customer retention, enhancing customer experience, and continuing to improve our cost structure over the coming months,"" he said. ""With these initiatives, we are on path to subscriber and revenue stability and improved EBITDA later this year."" Cutting the company's dividend may upset shareholders, but the cut from $0.105 to $0.04 per share will free up about $300 million in cash annually, a figure that will rise to $400 million in the second half of 2018, according to McCarthy. That cash will be used to pay down debt at a faster rate. ""We also intend to issue secured debt in the near term to address upcoming maturities and reduce our cash interest expense,"" the CEO said. ""As our board looked at our long-term capital allocation strategy, we believe it was prudent to reduce the dividend now, enabling us to address the larger debt towers in coming years and giving us ample runway to delever."" While Q1 was the fourth straight quarter of subscriber losses since the CTF deal closed, McCarthy has had evolving explanations for those drops. For the first two quarters, he blamed a lack of marketing efforts due to complications from moving so many customers over. For the most recent two, he has cited Frontier having to purge its rolls of non-paying former Verizon subscribers. During the Q1 call though, he cited some positive signs. ""This was the third sequential quarter of gross adds improvement in CTF,"" he said. ""This was largely driven by a full quarter of our robust marketing program. We continue to fine-tune our distribution strategies and launched an enhanced digital commerce channel at the very end of the first quarter."" ","

The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) has produced strong returns so far in 2017, rising 8% and setting new record-high closes 20 times since the beginning of the year. Yet for those who had hoped to outperform the Dow by using a popular strategy that focuses on high-dividend Dow components, this year hasn't been the best. The Dogs of the Dow are underperforming the broader market, and they've just barely managed to gain any ground at all as the year approaches the halfway point. Investment Price Gain in 2017 Year to Date Dow Jones Industrials 8.1% Dogs of the Dow 2.4% Source: Dogs of the Dow website. For those who aren't familiar with the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it's a simple way to try to improve on the performance of the overall Dow. To use the strategy, first figure out which 10 Dow stocks had the highest dividend yields at the beginning of 2017. Then, you invest equal amounts of money in each of the 10 stocks. Hold onto the stocks throughout the year, and at the beginning of 2018, you'll take a new look to see which 10 Dow components have the highest yields at that point. You can make replacements at that time, and then carry the strategy forward another year. The Dogs of the Dow strategy has been quite successful recently. In six of the past seven years, the strategy has outperformed the returns of the Dow Jones Industrials, and it has generated greater amounts of income in the process. That makes the Dogs especially attractive to dividend investors. Image source: Getty Images. However, as the table above shows, the Dogs of the Dow are well behind the overall Dow's performance. In general, there are four major reasons for the underperformance: It's too early to count the Dogs of the Dow out entirely. This year certainly isn't the first time that the Dogs have gotten off to a slow start, only to bounce back later in the year. In particular, because the Dogs of the Dow strategy combines elements of income and value investing philosophies, they will sometimes do better during times of greater market turbulence. Choppy markets often happen later in the year, especially in the historically challenging months of September and October, and that could give the Dogs an opportunity to catch up to and surpass the overall Dow. The big question for the Dogs is whether initiatives that investors have anticipated all year will come to pass before the end of 2017. For instance, a boom in construction and infrastructure spending at the federal government level could drive heightened sales and profits at heavy equipment manufacturer and Dow Dog Caterpillar, and its stock has already risen in anticipation of favorable trends. If those programs get put in place, then the corresponding rise could help push the Dogs forward overall. Conversely, pharma stocks have suffered from concerns over plans to control drug costs. With the two pure-play Dow pharma stocks both among the Dogs, any news that favors drug companies would disproportionately help the strategy's relative performance to the overall Dow. The Dogs of the Dow aren't living up to investors' expectations, but the strategy still has some long-term advantages in terms of simplicity, volatility, and risk-adjusted return. Moreover, with more than six months left in 2017, the Dogs of the Dow have every opportunity to make up for lost time and emerge victorious this year. ","

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of 30 of the most established and mature U.S. companies, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that many of the index components pay strong dividends. In fact, all 30 Dow components pay dividends, with annual yields ranging from 0.70% to 4.94%. Here are the 10 highest-paying Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, and a look at which ones are worth an investor's consideration now. Company Stock Symbol Recent Price Dividend Yield Verizon Communication VZ $46.72 4.94% Chevron CVX $106.40 4.06% Pfizer PFE $32.77 3.91% International Business Machines IBM $154.10 3.89% ExxonMobil XOM $82.13 3.75% Cisco Systems CSCO $31.37 3.70% General Electric GE $27.94 3.44% Coca-Cola KO $45.32 3.27% Procter & Gamble PG $88.16 3.13% Intel Corporation INTC $35.71 3.05% Data Source: TD Ameritrade. Prices and dividend yields as of 6/10/17. Having said that, if you're looking for high-dividend stocks, here are three Dow components that may be worth a look right now. Telecom giant Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is perhaps my single favorite stock for investors whose top priority is income. It pays nearly 5% per year, and its dividend is backed by reliable cash flow generated from its subscribers. In fact, Verizon's dividend represents about 62% of 2017's expected earnings of $3.75 per share, so the company could even absorb a significant earnings drop and still maintain its dividend payment. Image Source: Getty Images. The stock also has a history of low volatility, so it can produce a bond-like income stream, while still allowing you to sleep soundly at night. In addition, the stock trades for just 12.4 times 2017 earnings, far below the S&P 500's average forward earnings multiple of approximately 19. Tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), better known as IBM, hasn't exactly performed well lately. ""Big Blue"" has fallen out of favor with investors, and its share price has fallen by 16% in the past three months alone, fueled by weaker-than-expected earnings in April and a downgrade of its credit rating in May. Warren Buffett's decision to sell 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the company didn't help, either. However, picking up shares of IBM now while the price is low could be a smart idea. IBM's cloud-related business is thriving and has room to grow. In fact, IBM's software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales grew 59% over the past year, and its high-growth ""strategic imperatives"" businesses now account for 42% of revenue and are growing at a double-digit rate. Plus, at just 11 times forward earnings and a nearly 4% yield that's covered more than twice over by the company's earnings, this could turn out to be an excellent value play for patient investors. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil companies in the world, and is among the top dividend payers, as well. Not only is ExxonMobil's dividend one of the highest in the Dow, but the company has a 34-year track record of dividend increases, no matter what the economy or the price of oil was doing. To be clear, I'm a fan of both oil stocks on the list (Chevron being the other), but I think ExxonMobil's size gives it a bit of an advantage. Perhaps my favorite thing about Exxon is its diverse business, which includes oil drilling, chemicals, and refining, just to name a few. Some of these obviously do better when oil prices are high, such as the company's drilling operations. However, when oil prices fall, refining profits actually increase. In other words, ExxonMobil is set up to make money no matter what oil prices do. In addition, the company has a rock-solid balance sheet and has historically been more effective at generating returns on capital than peers, as my colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out in a recent article. Finally, while renewable energy is definitely surging in popularity, oil demand is still expected to grow going forward. So don't worry about oil ""going away"" -- it isn't happening anytime soon.

    10 Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks in The Dow Jones Industrial Average -- The Motley Fool

768,Brian Feroldi,6222017,Fool,6152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to investing in dividend-paying stocks, sometimes bigger is better. Any company that can afford to spend billions on dividend payments each year must have a solid business model. Otherwise, it would never promise to share so much wealth with its shareholders. So which companies are the biggest dividend payers on the market today? Here's a closer look at eight companies that have spent at least $8 billion on dividend payments over the past year. Image source: Apple. Sporting a market cap of around $765 billion, tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become one of the world's largest publicly traded companies. Long-term shareholders can credit the company's phenomenal run to the tremendous popularity of the iPhone, while other products such as the iPad, Apple TV, the Apple Watch, and Mac computers, have helped round out the company's ecosystem. Over the past four quarters, Apple's suite of products has cranked out more than $45 billion in total profits. With so much cash coming in, Apple's management team has made a commitment to return a huge amount of its excess capital to shareholders. Part of that plan calls for regular dividend payments, and over the past 12 months, Apple has put more than $12 billion directly into shareholders' pockets. While Apple's 1.7% yield might not seem all that high, that $12 billion makes Apple the largest dividend payer on this list. Image source: Getty Images. The enormous plunge in oil and gas prices has hit every energy company hard over the past few years. That includes energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), as the integrated oil company's financial statements are sensitive to big commodity price swings. From peak to trough, Chevron's revenue plunged nearly 50% through the downturn, while profits fell even harder. Despite the pain, Chevron remained committed to paying out its strong dividend. That's quite an accomplishment, as its total dividend payments of more than $8 billion have dwarfed the company's net income of $2.9 billion over the past four quarters. Chevron has largely relied on asset sales to help fund the difference between the two numbers. The company's recent results are starting to paint a rosier picture. Production and energy prices are climbing, while costs are on the decline. If this trend holds up, then Chevron's profitability should start to bounce back. John Flannery was recently named chairman and CEO of General Electric. Image source: General Electric. General Electric (NYSE:GE) has reinvented itself several times since its founding more than a century ago. In recent years, GE has been focused on returning to its industrial roots and has been selling off a variety of business units. Investors also recently learned that longtime CEO Jeff Immelt is stepping aside and being replaced by industry veteran John Flannery to keep the transition going. In spite of all of the changes, GE has remained committed to using its huge financial resources to reward its shareholders. Over the past 12 months, GE has spent more than $8.5 billion on dividend payments. At current prices, GE's stock yields more than 3.4%. If Flannery's changes can get the company's profit engine humming, then shareholders should be able to expect ever more dividend bumps in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been an acquisition machine for decades and now counts more than 250 operating companies in its empire. Its companies sell products in three broad product categories: consumer products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. While all three divisions churn out predictable profits, the company is counting on its pharmaceutical division to deliver revenue and profit growth over the next few years. One big benefit of selling healthcare products is that demand tends to be very stable. That has afforded Johnson & Johnson will the luxury of being able to pass along regular price increases and provide its shareholders with regular dividend bumps. In fact, J&J has grown its dividend for 54 years in a row. Over the past year, J&J has paid out more than $8.6 billion in dividends to its investors, which gives its stock a yield of more than 2.5%. That's impressive, but since its dividend payment consumes only about half of net income, there appears to be plenty of room left for dividend increases down the road. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was slow to embrace the cloud-computing revolution, but all of that changed when CEO Satya Nadella took the reins in 2014. The company has since invested aggressively to move its iconic Office suite of products into the cloud. In addition, Microsoft's Azure web-services platform is growing quickly and currently holds the second-place spot behind Amazon.com. When combined with the success of its Surface products, Mr. Softy's profits have trended in the right direction over the past few years. With a growing pile of profits, Microsoft has used its ample cash hoard to reward shareholders with regular dividend increases. Over the past year, Microsoft has spent more than $11.6 billion on its dividend payments, and that generous payout represents only about two-thirds of the company's $17.8 billion in total net income. With profits expected to increase as the company's move to the cloud continues to takes hold, investors should be able to expect more dividend bumps from here. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T (NYSE:T) has enjoyed surging demand for wireless data as consumers have raced to get their hands on the largest and greatest smartphone. However, the market now appears to be saturated, and wireless prices are falling, so the company is looking for a new avenue to drive profit growth from here. That's why the company is pushing hard to complete its $108 billion acquisition of Time Warner. If the deal goes through, the company will be far more diversified and should have an easier time retaining customers by offering more attractive packaged deals. AT&T's investors should have their fingers crossed that the deal goes through, since the company's payout ratio is getting uncomfortably high. In the past year, AT&T has spent more than $11.7 billion on dividend payments, which is awfully close to the $12.5 billion in net income the company pulled in. While AT&T's 5% dividend yield is enticing, there isn't a whole lot of wiggle room should profits take a dip. That could happen if regulators choose to block the Time Warner transaction and wireless prices continue to fall. And that could put the company's 32-year-long history of consecutive dividend increases in jeopardy. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil is another energy giant that's been a bankable long-term investment. The company has paid out a growing dividend for 35 consecutive years, which includes its recent 2.7% bump earlier this year. Exxon's enviable track record has been driven by its management team's knack for using capital effectively. The company places an emphasis on funding projects that have high returns on capital, which helped to keep its profit engine humming throughout the recent downturn. Over the past year, Exxon has churned out more than $10 billion in net income, which is impressive given the energy slump. While that wasn't enough to fully cover the $12.7 billion spent on dividends, Exxon's profits are on the upswing thanks to cost-cutting measures and stronger commodity prices. With plenty of growth projects waiting in the wings, it might not be long before ExxonMobil's earnings fully cover the 3.7% dividend yield. Image source: Getty Images. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is another dominant telecommunications giant that cranks out huge amounts of profits each year. While the company is also experiencing pricing pressure in the wireless space, the company's recent move to offer unlimited data is helping keep its customers loyal. Like AT&T, Verizon has gone on a spending spree as of late, as a way to drive future profit growth. The company recently bought out both AOL and Yahoo! in an effort to build out its digital advertising business. Verizon has increased its dividend each year for more than a decade and currently offers a 5% yield. Over the past year, its dividend has consumed $9.2 billion, but that's only about 75% of the $12.2 billion in net income it pulled in. If the company's big bets on digital advertising pay off, the company's streak of dividend increases shoulnd be able to continue from here. ","

What if there’s less difference between the two than you might expect? As the broader market appears to be entering a period where value may be better positioned than growth—following a decadelong run of losing to both growth and the overall market—investors hoping for exposure to one strategy over the other should be careful: There’s a notable degree of overlap between two widely used exchange-traded funds that offer exposure to these strategies, an issue that could muddle their efficiency in diversifying one’s portfolio.

                                   which owns the iShares suite of funds, couldn’t be immediately reached for a comment. “Vanguard is definitely more pure—it is focused on just growth or value, whereas the iShares approach is more about tilting towards one or the other, not being exclusionary,” Venuto said. “If you’re using them to balance each other out, that wouldn’t work. You need to be sure that the portfolio you’re constructing looks the way you want it to; just because you’re using ETFs, that doesn’t mean you’re not a stock picker still.” The overlap hasn’t meant that the value and growth funds see the same performance. The iShares growth fund is up 14.5% thus far this year, while the value fund is up 4.9%. However, the two did have a narrower gap in performance than the Vanguard products, where the value fund is up 5.4% in 2017 and the growth one is up 15.8%. Such “smart beta” funds screen an underlying index—the S&P 500 in the case of iShares—for names that meet its inclusion criteria. A value fund, for example, might look at such metrics as price-to-earnings and price-to-book and buy the names that appear undervalued on these scores. (There are 319 holdings in the growth ETF and 351 in the value fund.) That a stock appears in both funds doesn’t necessarily reflect a problem with the way the funds are constructed; companies can have attributes of both. In the case of Johnson & Johnson, “the idea that it’s both growth and value is interesting,” Venuto said. “It is a major part of the consumer space, which is growing, but at the same time it’s also an old-school established dividend play.” Apple Inc.

However, Apple’s price-to-earnings ratio is 17.12, below the P/E of the S&P 500 at around 22. That boosts the argument that it is a value play.

                                   has struggled mightily recently. Shares of the media publishing company fell more than 5% Thursday, in the wake of its announcement this week that it was cutting 300 jobs in a major restructuring. To add insult to injury, analysts at Macquarie Research downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform on Thursday. “Time’s rejection of unsolicited offers for the company in late April puts the heat on the company to even more rapidly enact a turnaround,” lead analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients. “Time will now be pruning select magazine titles to raise cash and de-risk from this large portion of their revenue base, which should enable them to launch more digital-only brands.” Don’t miss:  Time Inc. to cut 300 jobs in shift to digital Time’s declines in print circulation and advertising are accelerating, Nollen said, and at the moment the company is struggling to offset those declines with growth in online video. The company, which owns such magazine brands as namesake Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Fortune, hopes the cuts it announced will help streamline the business and allow it focus on digital and video opportunities. Time Inc. made sure to make a big display of its digital and video potential during its Newfront in May and showcased its new and upcoming projects to a ballroom full of potential advertisers. But right now print still makes up about 70% of Time’s revenue, and in the first quarter print ad revenue declined 21%. In the company’s first-quarter earnings release it said its 8% decline in overall revenue reflected the declines in print, advertising and circulation revenues. And it likely won’t get any better in the second quarter with Manga Global forecasting that magazine advertising will continue to drop as much as 25% year-over-year by 2021.

By Amazon.com is one of the biggest, and therefore most influential, stocks in the U.S. equity market, and it has surged more than 30% so far this year. Netflix is another trading favorite, up more than 20% in 2017 and nearly 60% over the past 12 months. So here’s a trivia question: how much have these iconic stocks, both of which embody the current internet age, directly contributed to the gain of the overall technology sector, itself the biggest gainer of the year, up more than 14%? Trick question—they’ve contributed nothing. That answer may come as a surprise, given that Amazon

Wall Street is riddled with such counterintuitive sector placements, and this has become more of an issue as companies expand into business lines that are outside of their primary industry. “Companies today are not old fashioned monoliths that only do one thing; they do a wide range of stuff,” said David Blitzer, who, as the chairman and a managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices helps decide which sector S&P 500 companies are assigned to. Companies with major presences in multiple sectors “is an issue that we’ve been increasingly grappling with in the past few years.” A number of companies appear in sectors that one might not expect.

However, there are only 10 select sector indexes because there aren’t enough telecom stocks to merit their own distinct index.) But Amazon is perhaps the biggest example of how difficult it has become to classify stocks within a single sector category. That it is classified as a discretionary name is certainly logical. While it is “the epitome of the tech business,” as Blitzer described it, Amazon is also one of the biggest names in retail, just of the (mostly) online sort. However, a notable part of Amazon’s revenue comes from its cloud-computing technology, a business segment that, were it spun out into its own company, would likely be considered tech, even though it could be argued it has many of the same attributes as a utility. Amazon also has begun producing its own video content, something that makes it a competitor to media companies. Further complicating the issue, consumers use Amazon to buy consumer staples, not just discretionary items, unlike the retailers that cater to more specific consumer categories. And on Friday, Amazon agreed to buy Whole Foods

                                   which, as a grocery store, falls into the consumer staples space. Companies can’t be in two sectors at once, so what keeps Amazon in discretionary? Sector assignments are dictated by the global industry classification standard, which is a joint effort between S&P Dow Jones and MSCI. To classify a company, the GICS team looks at its different revenue streams, which determine what various subindexes the company fits into. There are more than 170 such niche categories, but if more than 65% of a company’s revenue is in one subindex, the company is assigned to whatever sector that subindex fits into. In Amazon’s case, the online retail business—discretionary spending, for the most part—surpasses this threshold. “If you’re making 10% of your money from cloud computing and 90% from selling stuff, you’re selling stuff,” Blitzer said. “From our point of view, it’s a retailer.” Other companies are harder to classify, with Blitzer singling out Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

There is precedent for companies jumping from sector to sector as their business focus changes. Perhaps most notably, S&P last year decided that real-estate companies had become prominent enough on their own to merit their own separate category. As such, they were spun out from their former home, financials. Investors are increasingly looking to passive index-based funds to get broad exposure to the market, and the 10 Select Sector funds are among the most popular ways to make bets on individual sectors; the 10 SPDR ETFs have $121.6 billion in combined assets, according to FactSet data. Because of this, confusion about where companies do or should fit can cause a problem. If Amazon moves on tech news, that can have an influence on the rest of the consumer discretionary sector. Blitzer said he was aware that some people may buy a sector fund to get exposure to a particular trend and not realize the companies they want aren’t actually in it. Related: The biggest emerging-market ETF doesn’t hold some of the biggest EM stocks “It seems like no one reads the prospectus, and that no one outside our office reads the methodology of our funds,” he said. “I’d like everyone to read the documents carefully, but if they don’t, so long as our stuff is correct and available, we’ve done as much as we can.” ",Did you buy a tech ETF to cash in on Amazon?

His successor will have to manage a myriad of troubles for the company.
    USA TODAY ""The thing that made him and the company successful is now causing havoc,"" Brad Stone, author of The Upstarts, which chronicles category-altering companies such as Uber and Airbnb, says of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.(Photo: Will Oliver, USA TODAY) SAN FRANCISCO — Want to run Uber? You'd better have a steel constitution for cleaning up cultural rot and the insight to make the leaky business profitable. As the ride-hailing start-up gets set to replace co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick, who resigned late Tuesday after a group of investor firms pushed him to quit, it's on the hunt for a change agent who can revamp a company that's riddled with uncertainty and still hasn't passed one of the biggest tests of a start-up — its IPO. ""The challenges they face as a business are as substantial as the recruiting challenges,"" says Stephen Beck, founder of competitive strategy consultancy cg42. ""There is a combination of factors that will create some significant pause for any qualified manager to come in."" Among the issues: — A host of new faces in both vacant senior positions as well as on the board. On Wednesday, Uber confirmed that TPG Capital's David Bonderman, who stepped down after a sexist remark during the company's all-hands on sexism and other matters, will be replaced by TPG's David Trujillo. And Benchmark Capital confirmed that longtime Kalanick adviser turned skeptic Bill Gurley will be replaced by Benchmark's Matt Cohler. — Whether Kalanick, who remains on the board with powerful voting shares, is truly out of the picture. With this forceful personality still tinkering under Uber's hood, some candidates might balk. — How entrenched its cultural problems are. They range from a sexist work environment to strategic practices that sometimes skirt the law. Uber has many top positions to fill, including president, COO and CFO, meaning big leadership holes at a company with 12,000 employees. — And perhaps most significantly is the tenuous ride-hailing business model. It relies heavily on raised capital to keep fares artificially low. Uber and Lyft both are ploughing money into self-driving cars, but it remains to be seen when that cost-saving tech will fully come on line. CEO Travis Kalanick's decision to take an indefinite leave of absence calls Uber's IPO plans into question. (Photo: Uber Technologies) Uber's board has not made clear the extent of Kalanick's removal from day-to-day operations, nor has it clearly signaled how it will snare a CEO at this pivotal time in the company's history. Raising the urgency: its market share has slipped to rival Lyft and its brand image is tarnished with riders. ""It's surprising how incomplete the messaging is from (Uber's) board, ranging from Kalanick's exact role to who they're retained to conduct the CEO search,"" says Jason Schloetzer, a corporate governance expert and professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. ""The fact that so much wasn't said reveals the continued instability at the highest levels of Uber."" Schloetzer says that if Kalanick stays involved in key Uber decisions, that might cause CEO candidates ""to be cautious about throwing their hat in the ring."" An Uber spokesperson wouldn't elaborate on the board's statement, which framed Kalanick's departure as ""a bold decision and a sign of his devotion and love for Uber,"" while allowing the company ""to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber’s history."" Candidates for this challenging but potentially lucrative CEO post — Uber has been valued at upward of $70 billion — are at this point just rumored. They include names that were reported in past weeks as Uber searched for a chief operations officer to partner with Kalanick at the helm. A Fox Business report citing unnamed sources mentioned two potential COO candidates, Thomas Staggs, the former Walt Disney COO, and Karenann Terrell, former chief information officer of Walmart. The names of YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and former Ford CEO Alan Mulally, credited with a turnaround and winning the hearts of employees, have also been thrown into the ring, reports tech site Recode. Another buzzy Silicon Valley name is Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, whose operations acumen and cultural imprimatur could serve Uber well. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg at the 92nd Street Y in New York on April 23. (Photo: Noam Galai, WireImage) p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica}span.s1 {font-kerning: none} But Sandberg is unlikely to leave the social networking company if offered the role, according to sources close to Sandberg. Although hiring a woman for the top Uber job would send a powerful signal that its egregious treatment of women might come to a swift end, the company must deal in concrete changes and not merely symbolic ones, says Barbara Annis, founder of Gender Intelligence Group and co-author with Richard Nesbitt of Results at the Top: Using Gender Intelligence to Create Breakthrough Growth. ""You can’t put the onus on one woman to fix that problem, you need to look at the whole leadership team,"" says Annis. ""There’s a whole cultural norm at Uber, an alpha-male culture that is part of its nature. So let’s put someone in who has a value system and can create an inclusive culture with a management team aligned on that. You don’t want the 'poster woman' in there."" Then there's the cult of the founder. The tech industry in particular has a fascination with the role a founder plays in driving the innovation that distinguishes one start-up in a field with another. That belief is persuasive enough to bring some ousted leaders back. Consultant Beck cites two familiar examples of iconic brands that were saved when founders stepped back in, Apple (with Steve Jobs) and Starbucks (with Howard Schultz). ""Some say, 'founders can only take a company so far,' but there are examples when professional management isn't always the panacea you hope for."" Related: Uber hits some mammoth potholes Yes, Uber has lost ridership to Lyft during this crisis Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Can Uber really change? An Uber engineer killed himself. His widow says the workplace is to blame. In fact, before Kalanick's abrupt departure — as recently as last week, the CEO had decided to opt for an extended leave in part to grieve the death of his mother after a late May boating accident — board member Arianna Huffington had repeatedly mentioned how Kalanick was integral to Uber's disruptive nature. And new human resources chief Liane Hornsey told USA TODAY that her boss was ""extraordinarily fair"" and bent on changing the company while driving it forward on a global scale. With such testimonials, there could be a temptation to keep Kalanick involved, thereby limited the corrective powers of a new CEO. Under Levandowski, Uber's self-driving program appeared to be making good progress. His abrupt departure leaves the program's prospects in doubt. (Photo: Uber Technologies) But perhaps the biggest hurdle facing any new chief executive isn't Uber's cultural problems or its legal issues, which range from a federal investigation into its Greyball technology that fooled regulators to an ongoing lawsuit brought by Google's self-driving car company Waymo over allegedly stolen trade secrets. And that is Uber's business model. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Times New Roman'}p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px}span.s1 {font-kerning: none} Despite heavy operational losses – Uber said it lost $708 million in the first three months of this year, narrower than Q4's $991 million — the ride-hailing start-up’s market value has floated between $69 billion and $70 billion, making it the most-valued unicorn company. But its public woes are causing Uber's shares to take a hit on the secondary market among investors. Brokers told news site The Information that investors in recent months have paid 15% less for Uber stock, lowering its market value to $50 billion. At the same time, the site reported, some Uber shareholders have looked to offload their holdings. Analysts have long been nervous about how both ride-hailing companies, Uber and Lyft, are spending some of the billions in cash on keeping fares artificially low in order to drive up ridership. That model ultimately resolves itself in one of two ways if the company wants to turn to profitability, critical if Uber wants to push ahead with an initial public offering: getting consumers so reliant on the service that they don't balk when prices are inevitably raised, or using self-driving technology to replace the costly human driver. Uber's next CEO will have to both fix a range of internal issues as well as convince investors that ultimately the company will become massively profitable, says Mike Ramsey, analyst with Gartner. ""I do think there's an existential threat to this business model,"" says Ramsey. ""There are already cracks in it. Despite what analysts say about their exponential growth, there are things that need to be worked out (with the model) or this won't work.""

We have experienced the advances in our computing devices, with smartphones having greater computing power than yesterday’s supercomputers. Now, every technology with a computing base is advancing on an exponential curve — including sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, synthetic biology and 3-D printing. And when technologies converge, they allow industries to encroach on one another. Uber became a threat to the transportation industry by taking advantage of the advances in smartphones, GPS sensors, and networks.

                                   Facebook, SpaceX, and Oneweb are in a race to provide Wi-Fi internet access everywhere through drones, microsatellites and balloons. At first, they will use the telecom companies to provide their services; then they will turn them into toast. The motivation of the technology industry is, after all, to have everyone online all the time. Their business models are to monetize data rather than to charge cell, data, or access fees. They will also end up disrupting electronic entertainment — and every other industry that deals with information. The disruptions don’t happen within an industry, as business executives have been taught by gurus such as Clayton Christensen, author of management bible “The Innovator’s Dilemma”; rather, they come from where you would least expect them to. Christensen postulated that companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because these markets usually have very tight profit margins or are too small, leading competitors to start off by providing lower-end products and then scale them up, or to go for niches in a market that the incumbent is ignoring. But the competition no longer comes from the lower end of a market; it comes from other, completely different, industries. The problem for incumbents, the market leaders, is that they aren’t ready for this disruption and are often in denial. Because they have succeeded in the past, companies believe that they can succeed in the future, that old business models can support new products. Large companies are usually organized into divisions and functional silos, each with its own product development, sales, marketing, customer support and finance functions. Each division acts from self-interest and focuses on its own success; within a fortress that protects its ideas, it has its own leadership and culture. And employees focus on the problems of their own divisions or departments — not on those of the company. Too often, the divisions of a company consider their competitors to be the company’s other divisions; they can’t envisage new industries or see the threat from other industries. Read: 5 ways the Amazon–Whole Foods deal could change the way we shop This is why the majority of today’s leading companies are likely to go the way of Blockbuster, Motorola, Sears and Kodak, which were at the top of their game until their markets were disrupted, sending them toward oblivion. Companies now have to be on a war footing. They need to learn about technology advances and see themselves as a technology startup in Silicon Valley would: as a juicy target for disruption. They have to realize that the threat may arise in any industry, with any new technology. Companies need all hands on board — with all divisions working together employing bold new thinking to find ways to reinvent themselves and defend themselves from the onslaught of new competition. The choice that leaders face is to disrupt themselves — or to be disrupted.

778,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"The news stoked speculation about the future of the T-Mobile-Sprint tie-up, and also about other potential merger partners for T-Mobile. Analysts have said that the telecoms and cable sectors are primed for a wave of deal activity, and executives have openly talked about potential mergers. If the talks with Charter and Comcast fail, Sprint’s negotiating position could weaken if it were to restart merger talks with T-Mobile, JPMorgan analysts said. T-Mobile’s shares fell 3.3 percent on Tuesday to $61.06, while Dish shares were up 0.3 percent at $64.02. Sprint shares were last up 2.7 percent at $8.22. Analysts have speculated that Dish, a satellite TV provider that has been buying up wireless spectrum, could be an attractive acquisition target for both Verizon and T-Mobile. Sprint’s talks to provide the backbone for a wireless network for Comcast and Charter serve as a “three-way hedge” for the companies, said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “From a game theory perspective, this is a fascinating move,” Moffett wrote in an email. The two cable companies are hedging for a possible tie-up between Sprint and T-Mobile that could reduce their negotiating leverage, and the wireless deal also allows Sprint to hedge against the risk that a merger with T-Mobile never happens, Moffett said. A wireless deal with Comcast and Charter would also give Sprint more bargaining leverage if it does secure a tie-up with T-Mobile, he added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the negotiations between the companies on Monday, said Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. A minority equity investment was being discussed but that may not be part of any deal, sources told Reuters. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources said. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May in a bid to offset customer attrition as younger viewers shun high-priced subscriptions in favor of cheaper online options. Comcast also already has an MVNO agreement with Sprint that stems from the cable company’s 2008 investment in Clearwire Corp. A source familiar with the matter said Comcast would seek better terms for that agreement given the highly competitive nature of the wireless business and technological changes in the past nine years. MVNOs do not own networks, and instead rent capacity from established operators to sell on to their customers, usually at low prices due to their small overheads, with cheap distribution through the internet or convenience stores. The cable companies’ agreement with Verizon restricts them to offer wireless within their own service areas, while a deal with Sprint could allow them to offer the service nationally. Verizon shares were down 1.6 percent on Tuesday at $44.97. ","

779,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"WILMINGTON, Del./BOSTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp used confidential information from its alliance with RadioShack Corp to open competing mobile phone stores, dooming the comeback by the electronics retailer and destroying jobs, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by RadioShack creditors. RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack’s official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. The lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack’s best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States. Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States. ","

780,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp is in talks with Charter Communications Inc and Comcast Corp about a partnership to boost the two U.S. cable companies’ wireless offerings, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sprint, controlled by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, has entered into a two-month period of exclusive negotiations with Charter and Comcast that has put its merger talks with U.S. wireless peer T-Mobile US Inc on hold till the end of July, the sources said on Monday. A deal with Sprint would build on a partnership that Charter and Comcast announced last month. The two cable operators have agreed that they would not do deals in the wireless space for a year without each other’s consent. Comcast has already unveiled plans for a wireless service, using its Wi-Fi hotspots and the airwaves of Verizon Communications Inc, the largest U.S. telecommunications provider, based on a deal between the two that dates back to 2011. Comcast and Charter are now in talks with Sprint to secure a similar network-resale agreement on better terms, the sources said. A previous nine-year-old network-resale agreement between Comcast and Sprint was never activated, one of the sources added. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the negotiations, also said that Charter and Comcast were in preliminary talks to take an equity stake in Sprint as part of an agreement. Such a deal would allow Sprint to invest more in its network, the newspaper added. One of the sources said that a minority equity investment was being discussed but that it may not be part of any deal. Charter and Comcast could also look at jointly acquiring Sprint, but that is unlikely, the sources added. Sprint, Comcast and Charter declined to comment. An agreement with the cable providers over its network does not mean Sprint may not also seek a merger agreement with T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG, the sources said. Sprint sees the partnership as increasing competition in the market, which should help alleviate any antitrust concerns over a merger with T-Mobile, the source added. Investors have long expected a deal between T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless service providers, anticipating cost cuts and other synergies in the range of $6 billion to $10 billion. Three years ago, Sprint ended a previous round of talks to acquire T-Mobile amid opposition from U.S. antitrust regulators. ","

781,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders. The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market. The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump’s effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs. On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, seeking their help to make the government’s computing systems more efficient. He will meet with energy industry leaders next week. “We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs,” Trump told the executives on Thursday. “We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.” In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc. Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000. Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today’s 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain. Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

782,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of $750 million senior unsecured notes due 2027. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing debt, including debt under its 2013 and 2014 revolving credit facilities. Proceeds may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, pro forma outstanding borrowings on AMT's RCFs totalled approximately $2.9 billion. The pro forma amount reflects the net repayment of approximately $95 million on is 2013 credit facility subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2017. AMT currently has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong FCF and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently around 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain relatively stable margins. Tower revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: At March 31, 2017, net leverage was 5.0x, and Fitch expects AMT's net leverage to decline slightly to under 5.0x at the end of 2017. Leverage has gradually declined following AMT's acquisitions over the last couple of years, including the acquisition of the rights to towers and outright purchases of towers from Verizon Communications Inc. in 2015. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur, would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international operations generated approximately 34% of total property revenues in the first quarter of 2017. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --In 2017, consolidated revenue grows to approximately $6.6 billion, based on expectations for property revenue to be near the mid-point of company guidance of $6.5 billion. In 2018 and thereafter, Fitch assumes revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2017 due to the lower margins associated with acquired properties but increase moderately thereafter as additional tenants are added to towers. --Capital spending of approximately $850 million in 2017. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF, cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2016, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was approximately $1 billion. As of March 31, 2017, cash approximated $713 million and unused revolver capacity was approximately $1.77 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $564 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility due in January 2022 (the 2014 RCF) and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June 2020 (the 2013 RCF). The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x (up to 7.0x for specified time periods following a qualified acquisition). The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. There are no material maturities in 2017, and approximately $1.5 billion matures in 2018. Contact: Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

(AABA) holds the balance of the remaining Yahoo assets, including 15.4% of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), following Verizon Communications Inc.'s (VZ) partial acquisition. The newly minted $52 billion market cap seems pricey, but no one really knows the value of this corporate hodgepodge or how it's going to grow in the coming years. Technically speaking, the stock is well positioned for gains through the rest of 2017 because the new entity has adopted Yahoo's long-term chart, yielding a timely breakout above the 2014 high at $52.62. While it's easy to second guess this glued-together reporting, consider that other big caps including United States Steel Corporation (X) and AT&T Inc. (T) have also sewn together bits and pieces of newly acquired operations or divestitures into multi-decade price charts. (See also: What Is Altaba Anyway?) AABA Long-Term Chart (1996 – 2017) The former company came public at $1.49 (after adjustment for five stock splits) in April 1996 and fell into a downtrend that found support near 65 cents. It then entered a powerful trend advance driven by the awakening of the net bubble, rising to an all-time high at $125.03 in March 2000. The subsequent downtrend relinquished the majority of the prior decade's dramatic gains, dropping the stock more than 97% to $4.01 at the end of 2002. The subsequent uptrend topped out at $43.66 in January 2006, highlighting severe technical damage because the rally failed to reach the .386 Fibonacci bear market retracement level. A pullback into 2008 accelerated during the economic collapse, dropping the stock back into the single digits for the second time in six years. It underperformed badly after hitting a bottom in November 2008, stuck in a narrow trading range bounded by resistance in the upper teens. The stock took off in the strongest buying impulse so far this decade in the second half of 2012, breaking out above the 2006 high in October 2014 before topping out in the low $50s a few weeks later. It then entered a steep correction that found support in the upper $20s in early 2016, ahead of an equally strong bounce that reached within a few points of the prior high in May 2017, just a few weeks before this month's post-acquisition breakout. (For more, see: Verizon Officially Now Owns Yahoo, Mayer Resigns.) AABA Short-Term Chart (2015 – 2017) The sell-off into 2016 unfolded through an Elliott five-wave decline, perfectly aligned with bearish action throughout the tech universe during that period. The stock tested the September 2015 low at $27.20 in February 2016, broke down and then rallied strongly, setting off a 2B buy signal that denotes the failure of bears to hold new resistance. Rumors about a company sale or divestiture generated speculative buying interest into September, when it disclosed high-profile hacking incidents that raised questions about the company's valuation. (For more, see: Yahoo Confirms Massive Data Breach.) On-balance volume (OBV) topped out in 2014 and entered a persistent distribution wave that ended four months before the price bottomed out in the first quarter of 2016. This bullish divergence contributed to steady buying interest that reached a new high ahead of the Verizon sale. The transaction triggered high-volume price bars and a sharp indicator downturn to a nine-month low, signaling aggressive profit taking as well as new purchases. The OBV downturn tells us that the stock needs to rebuild previously loyal sponsorship to continue the 16-month uptrend. However, the price remains in breakout mode, and it makes sense to ignore recent signals because they're unfolding right at the interface between the two corporate identities. In other words, this seemingly bearish activity could reflect the natural rotation from one set of shareholder hands to another. (See also: On-Balance Volume: The Way to Smart Money.) Altaba came to life after Yahoo sold key assets to Verizon, with the new entity using the parent's long-term chart. The split has triggered a major breakout undermined by a bearish volume signal, but we'll ignore that red flag for now, given broad tech strength and confusion about the new entity's legitimate supply and demand.

The company said Thursday a total of 64,514,767 shares of its stock were tendered at or below the final purchase price of $53.20 a share. Altaba said it accepted the purchase price and spent about $3.4 billion to buy back the shares. The $3.4 billion excludes fees and expenses related to the tender offer and represents around 6.7% of the shares outstanding as of June 20.

The company started trading this week under the name Altaba, which is a play on the world ""alternative"" and Alibaba (BABA), in which it has a 15% stake, valued at around $341 billion. Recently, shares of Altaba were trading up 0.53%, or $0.28 to $55.34. The stock has been gaining all week as investors view it as a cheaper way to get a piece of Alibaba Group, the Chinese ecommerce giant. While the former Yahoo basically looks like a holding company for a stake in the Chinese retailer, Yahoo warned in a regulatory filing last year that Alibaba could get hit with a massive tax bill of as much as 36.5% if it tried to buy back the shares. Investors also get access to a stake in Yahoo Japan valued at $7.7 billion by owning shares of Altaba. The company also has $12 billion in cash and marketable debts, $130 million in minority investments including in Snap Inc. (SNAP) and a $740 million stake in Excalibur, which is a unit of the new company that holds patents of Yahoo that were not sold to Verizon. Leading the new company is Yahoo board member Thomas McInerney, formerly the chief financial officer for IAC/InterActiveCorp.

Telecom stocks are popular with income investors because they offer high yields and steady growth and their moats are tough for new competitors to cross. But with so many telco stocks on the market, it can be hard to identify the best plays. Let's take a closer look at three of my personal favorites -- AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and BCE (NYSE:BCE). AT&T pays a forward dividend yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend annually for over three decades. It spent 95% of its earnings and 70% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so it can easily keep raising its dividend for the foreseeable future. Image source: Pixabay. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's the largest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its purchase of DirecTV in 2015. If its proposed takeover of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles, it will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world. AT&T is bundling these services together in lucrative packages to lock in customers. Its wireless customers, for example, can stream content from DirecTV and its ""sponsored data"" partners without the usage counting toward their data plans. It also recently bundled Time Warner's HBO channels with its unlimited wireless plans. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year and for its earnings to rise 2%. Those are lackluster growth figures, but the stock trades at just 19 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. Verizon also pays a forward yield of 5.2%, and it's hiked that dividend for 10 straight years. It spent 76% of its earnings on those dividends over the past 12 months. However, Verizon's free cash flow also dipped into the red over the past year -- partly due to its buyout of Vodafone's stake in Verizon Wireless in 2014 and its subsequent purchases of AOL and Yahoo's internet business. Data source: YCharts. Verizon merged those two aging businesses into a new company called Oath, led by former AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Armstrong recently claimed that the new media platform would attract over 10 million creators for 2 billion customers and generate between $10 billion to $20 billion in annual revenues -- which would represent 12% of Verizon's 2016 revenue at the midpoint. Verizon plans to bundle all of these internet and media properties into its own wireless and wireline ecosystem. Like AT&T, it's using sponsored data to lock in customers with data-free streaming -- a strategy that both telcos hope will offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless customers. Analysts see Verizon's revenue and earnings both slipping 3% this year on the slowdown of its core wireless business and its increased investments in its ecosystem. However, both figures are expected to turn positive next year, and the stock remains cheaper than AT&T at 15 times earnings. BCE, formerly known as Bell Canada Enterprises, is the largest telecom company in Canada. It generates most of its revenue from internet, phone, and TV packages, but also generates additional revenue from investments in media outlets, real estate holdings, and professional sport teams. BCE pays a forward dividend yield of 4.8%, and it's hiked that dividend on an annualized basis for two straight years. It spent 83% of its earnings and 87% of its free cash flow on those payments over the past 12 months -- so its payout looks very sustainable. Unlike AT&T and Verizon, BCE is posting steady growth in wireless postpaid subscribers, which is only partly offset by its weaker prepaid growth. Its wireline business also continues growing, thanks to the strength of its internet and TV businesses. Analysts expect BCE's revenue to rise 4% this year, but its earnings are expected to slip 1% -- partly due to its recent takeover of Manitoba Telecom Services. But above all, BCE isn't copying AT&T's and Verizon's strategies of expanding their media ecosystems or divesting their wireline businesses. So if you're looking for a simpler telco with fewer moving parts, BCE -- which trades at a reasonable 18 times earnings -- might fit the bill. ","

789,Andrew Tonner,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Comparing American telecom players Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) to one another is like comparing the Major Leagues to Triple-A. They technically play the same sport, but they operate at entirely different scales. Thankfully, in the investing world, stocks of all shapes and sizes can make for potential buys; we're equal-opportunity investors here at the Fool. So keeping that in mind, let's look at CenturyLink and Verizon across three important categories to determine which company looks like the more appealing investment today. As a baseline, investors need to first understand the financial stability of any prospective investment before digging into its broader growth and valuation narratives. To guide this analysis, let's look at four metrics to get a sense of how Verizon and CenturyLink stack up in terms of liquidity and solvency. Company Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio CenturyLink $214 million $19.6 billion $4.2 billion 0.9 Verizon $4.3 billion $116.8 billion $16.9 billion 1.0 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The aforementioned difference in scale between the two comes into sharper contrast here. However, it should also jump out that, though they differ quite dramatically in absolute size, CenturyLink and Verizon share fairly similar capital structure and cash flow generation profiles. The two companies share virtually identical current ratios. Beyond that, CenturyLink carries just 1.1% of its total debt load in cash and investments, whereas Verizon holds 2.6% of its borrowings in liquid assets -- not much difference there. Alternatively, CenturyLink's 12-month cash flow from operations represents 21.4% of its total debt, whereas Verizon's cash flows only account for 10.1% of its $116.8 billion in debt. Granted, Verizon enjoys an investment-grade credit rating versus CenturyLink's non-investment-grade rating, so Verizon's cost of borrowing is likely lower. However, since the two share so much in common in terms of their financial footprint, it seems fairest to call this section a tie and move on. Image Source: Getty Images. Here's where the differences between the two start to really hit home. As the largest wireless provider in the U.S., Verizon's business model is largely predicated on providing wireless services to consumers and businesses -- $89 billion of its $125 billion in fiscal 2016 revenue came from wireless. Though the U.S. wireless market is no longer growing as fast as it once was, the space is generally stable. Alongside the other U.S. wireless monolith AT&T, Verizon's massive financial resources should allow it to effectively compete against continued competition from T-Mobile and Sprint. Moreover, the company is attempting to align itself with the broader trends in the wireless industry, most notably by buying its way into mobile advertising via its AOL and Yahoo acquisitions. For the record, I like AT&T's growth strategy more, but there's little reason to fret over Verizon's long-term place as a central player in this space. CenturyLink, on the other hand, finds itself in a slightly more precarious situation. In fact, $7.6 billion of the company's $17.4 billion in 2016 sales come from what CenturyLink calls its legacy services segment, which mostly consists of landline phone services for companies and consumers. As the company itself notes, this business is expected to remain in secular decline as the use of landline phones continues to dwindle. The remaining majority of CenturyLink's revenue comes from providing broadband and other data connectivity services to companies and individuals, which isn't necessarily a growth market either. The company hopes to shore up its competitive position via its pending merger with Level 3 Communications. The $34 billion deal should help expand CenturyLink's presence in the broadband service market and provide considerable cost savings. To be clear, this move is undoubtedly a smart one. However, it doesn't change the company's fundamental problem that it is largely tied to competitive markets that seem likely to decline over time. Looking to the final section of our analysis, let's start by reviewing three popular valuation metrics for Verizon and CenturyLink. Company P/E Forward P/E P/Cash Flow CenturyLink 15.6 12.2 12.3 Verizon 25.2 12.5 11.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, Morningstar. Chart by author. Let's also tie in analysts' consensus growth estimates here to provide a bit more context about each company's valuation. Wall Street expects Verizon's sales to decline 2.7% this year and grow 0.5% next year. For CenturyLink, the analyst community sees its sales falling 5.4% this year and 1.8% next year. In this light, Verizon's higher current P/E starts to appear more favorable, and its forward multiples seem more enticing. Lastly, any discussion of these two telecom names would be remiss without looking at their dividends, one of the hallmarks of telecom investing. Verizon currently pays out a comparatively lower 4.9% dividend, and its dividend payout ratio stands at 76% of net income. CenturyLink pays out an 8.5% dividend with a 211% dividend yield, which seems rather aggressive. Ultimately, a safer dividend can be better than a higher yield. Verizon wins this final portion of our analysis. Apologies to the CenturyLink fans in the crowd, but Verizon is simply a higher quality business in terms of its current strategy, its size within the space, its growth outlook, and the sustainability of its dividend. To be sure, CenturyLink's Level 3 buyout should help the company improve the efficiency of its operations. However, in thinking about which company you see thriving over the long term, Verizon is the clear winner in this matchup of telecom industry powers. ","

There are some stocks you couldn't persuade me to buy if they were the last tickers on the market. They are headed toward extinction-level events and are hardly worth the electrons their digital stock certificates are printed on. For me, that list includes fading retailer Sears Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ), near-forgotten smartphone veteran BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), and regional telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR). Your list of blackball stocks may be different; read on to see why I'm staying away from these tickers. Image source: Getty Images. Frontier Communications has a habit of picking up the landline and FiOS operations that Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) doesn't want to deal with anymore. Two large Verizon deals in 2010 and 2016 have more than quintupled Frontier's annual sales in seven years, yet they didn't help Frontier's earnings or free cash flows at all. Furthermore, the company's debt balances rose from $4.8 billion to $17.9 billion and annual interest expenses quadrupled to $1.5 billion. Lacking the large cash flows you'd expect from a mature telecom company, Frontier is cutting its dividend to help finance the debt-servicing costs. And management has not shown much concern for long-term shareholders, either -- the Verizon deals involved both new debt and a massive load of new Frontier shares going into the hands of Verizon's owners. Share prices have reacted as one might expect under this campaign of creative value destruction: FTR data by YCharts This is not a turnaround story just waiting to be told. It's a long, slow death march under the yoke of expensive and unprofitable wireline operations. I suppose the FiOS portion of Frontier's Verizon transactions could have worked out, since high-speed internet connections have worked wonders for other cable and telecom operators in recent years. But even there, Frontier is losing customers quarter by quarter and data service revenue keeps falling. I don't see a happy ending to Frontier's gloomy story. Not now, not in 10 years, not until the company completely shakes up its business model to come up with something that works. Failing that, this stock is going to zero in the long run. Once upon a time, BlackBerry was synonymous with ""smartphones."" High-quality physical keyboards made the company's devices a joy to use for secure text messaging and basic web browsing. Then Apple and the Android gang showed up with their sleek touchscreens and massive app stores. The smartphone game changed overnight, and BlackBerry never managed to find a foothold in the new market. This chart speaks volumes of BlackBerry's fading fortunes: BBRY data by YCharts BlackBerry CEO John Chen is turning the former smartphone giant into a very different business. The Canadian company is now all about secure messaging apps and data security tools. Best of luck, but BlackBerry burned a ton of credibility years ago. Any success the company finds at this point must be built from scratch, not resurrected from the glory days. This turnaround effort is a risky proposition, and it's easy enough to find better investments elsewhere. BlackBerry simply doesn't belong in my portfolio. Finally, I can't think of a single company more obviously headed to the scrap heap of history than Sears Holdings. The mall-based store chain started circling the drain long before Frontier or BlackBerry, and there's no going back: SHLD data by YCharts Kmart and Sears stores are closing their doors by the hundreds, the company is selling off real estate assets and household-name product brands to stay afloat, and billionaire CEO Eddie Lampert was forced to prop the balance sheet up with cash from his own pockets, since banks are no longer interested in doing business with Sears. I don't even have to aim my laser pointer at Sears to see it crumble. This company is falling apart on its own, and I don't want anything to do with it.

Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) is a company firing on all cylinders. In its 2017 first quarter results, all five of its business segments saw year-over-year revenue growth. Four of the five divisions-Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences-realized double-digit earnings increases over the previous year's results. Investors in the company have been rewarded for its performance as shares are up 47% over the past year. Yet, while the rally in Corning's shares has been fueled by a broad-based rise in the company's various business segments, it is the fast growth of two, in particular, that might have investors most excited. These divisions, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials, just scored major deals that highlight the opportunities of the industries they each compete in and the large macro trends that might drive further growth for years to come. GLW data by YCharts In the company's most recently reported quarter, its Optical Communications division saw sales of $818 million, a 34% year-over-year increase, and core earnings of $93 million, a whopping 258% year-over-year increase. This division supplies optical fiber to major telecom companies and internet service providers. With the need to upgrade their networks to meet the requirements of 5G soon, the demand for optical fiber isn't going away. Verizon agreed to purchase more than $1 billion of optical fiber from Corning over the next three years. Image source: Corning Incorporated. That's why it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Corning landed such a huge deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) mere days before the company reported its first-quarter earnings. The deal committed Verizon to purchase more than $1 billion in ""optical solutions"" over the next three years which translates to about 20 million kilometers of optical fiber that Corning will supply Verizon annually for the duration of the contract. Corning's CEO Wendell Weeks said the company could sell even more fiber to companies if it had additional manufacturing capacity. As Weeks succinctly put it in the company's first quarter conference call, ""If we had more, we could sell more."" For this reason, Corning is investing in additional optical fiber capacity, which is factored into the company's four-year plan of capital expenditure spending of $6-7 billion. Because of the company's ability to expand its capacity for manufacturing optical fiber, Weeks said he expects the company to grow ""significantly faster than the optical markets we serve."" If all goes according to plan, Corning's shareholders should expect to see further success in this segment. During the conference call, Weeks sounded especially optimistic when he stated: Stepping back, all of our customers have the opportunity to benefit from our unique set of capabilities in Optical Communications. We are engaged in deep dialogue with major telecom players across the globe as they anticipate transformations in communications, education, healthcare, transportation, and ultimately, the way that we all live. Corning's Optical Communications market access platform, essential to realizing their vision, because of our ability to economically expand capacity and deliver innovative solutions. In early May, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook announced the inception of his company's one billion dollar Advanced Manufacturing Fund to spur innovation among American manufacturers.

In the first quarter, the business segment saw sales of $300 million and core earnings of $48 million, respective 32% and 50% year-over-year increases. Gorilla Glass 5, the latest and greatest iteration of the specialty glass, has seen a more rapid adoption than previous generations of Gorilla Glass which has translated into gains in price premiums and market share for Corning. With more and more major smartphone manufacturers using glass on the front and backs of their products, it's little surprise that Apple would take such an interest in the glass manufacturing process just before a major product release of its own. Neither optical fiber, which is the backbone of the world's connectivity, or Gorilla Glass, the medium we touch to connect to the rest of the world, are going away anytime soon. The recent deal with Verizon and investment by Apple highlight the many opportunities ahead for Corning in these two growth segments. ","

IBM (NYSE:IBM) has disappointed plenty of investors, including Warren Buffett, with 20 straight quarters of annual revenue declines and a 20% haircut in its market value over the past five years. But as I discussed in previous articles, Big Blue's low valuation and high dividend should limit the stock's downside potential. IBM pays a forward yield of 3.9%, which is almost double the S&P 500's average yield of 2%. That dividend is supported by a low payout ratio of 46%, which gives it plenty of room to continue its 22 straight years of annual dividend hikes. Source: Getty. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, pays a slightly higher forward yield of 4%. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 71%, and Qualcomm has raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years. Source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm initially seems to have worse growth prospects than IBM, with analysts expecting its revenue and earnings to respectively fall 3% and 4% this year. Those declines are attributed to its loss of market share in mobile chipsets to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from bigger smartphone makers, and an OEM revolt against its high-margin wireless licensing fees. It's also dealing with a series of antitrust probes and lawsuits -- which claim that it leveraged its wireless patent portfolio to push competitors out of the market and secure exclusive deals. But looking ahead, Qualcomm is also expected to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in the near future, which would diversify its business away from the troubled mobile market, grow its addressable markets by 40% by 2020, and make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world. The deal is also expected to be ""significantly accretive"" to its non-GAAP earnings once it closes. I believe that's a better turnaround strategy than waiting around for IBM's ""strategic imperatives"" growth to finally pay off. Investors who think Qualcomm looks too risky should consider buying telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), which pays a forward yield of 5.1% and has hiked its dividend annually for over three decades -- making it a ""dividend aristocrat,"" a company that has hiked its payout for over 25 straight years. That dividend is supported by a payout ratio of 95%. AT&T is the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S. after Verizon, and it's also the biggest pay TV provider in the country, thanks to its acquisition of DirecTV in 2015. It will also become one of the biggest media companies in the world after its proposed acquisition of Time Warner clears regulatory hurdles. AT&T's flagship store in San Francisco. Source: AT&T. Analysts expect AT&T's revenue to fall 2% this year, and for its earnings to rise 2%. However, those estimates don't include the Time Warner deal, which could become accretive to AT&T's earnings and free cash flow within the first year, and generate $1 billion in annual run rate cost synergies within the first three years. In addition to offering higher yields and more exciting long-term growth prospects than IBM, Qualcomm and AT&T are also fundamentally cheap. Qualcomm trades at 19 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 25 for semiconductor companies. AT&T trades at 19 times earnings, versus the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. So before you buy IBM for its dividend, take a closer look at Qualcomm and AT&T to see if they better suit your income investing needs. I personally own both stocks as long-term income plays, and I'm not losing any sleep over either one. ","
      
    2 Stocks With Better Dividends than IBM -- The Motley Fool

793,Daniel B. Kline,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. That's an old saying, but it's one that most people keep in mind when they evaluate the latest offer from a cable company, internet service provider (ISP), or a wireless carrier. Even a company like T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), which built its rep on giving customers what they want, got greeted with skepticism earlier this year when it announced plans to drop all taxes and fees. In that case, the deal turned out to be exactly what was promised. That's not really true, however, when you look at Sprint's (NYSE:S) offer to cut your phone bill in half made to Verizon and AT&T customers. That promotion, while a good deal, only applied to the service portion of the bill, meaning people who accept the offer won't actually see their wireless bill cut in half. The same logic applies to many cable and ISP promotions where a short-term low price deal comes with a contract for future years that are more expensive. Pay television companies are notorious for offering prices that don't reflect the mandatory fees and surcharges customers have to pay. Because of that, news that Virgin Mobile (which is operated in the United States by Sprint) would be offering a year of unlimited talk, text, and data to customers who sign up by July 31 for $1 certainly caused consumers to raise an eyebrow. It seems like a phenomenal deal, but is it too good to be true? The Virgin Mobile deal requires buying an iPhone. Image source: Apple. The company is giving away a year of unlimited service (with high-speed data capped at 23GB a month) for $1, plus applicable taxes. That deal is not made up, it's not a bait-and-switch offer, but it's also not the whole story. To get a year of unlimited talk, text, and data for $1, the customer must purchase an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone and transfer his or her number to Virgin's Inner Circle plan, which costs $50 a month once the promotion ends. Virgin sells all currently offered iPhone models, including offering the entry-level iPhone SE for $279.99 for the 32GB version, which Apple sells for $399. The only thing approaching a catch here is one that's easy to avoid. To get the deal you need to buy an iPhone. If you buy one from Virgin, it will be locked, which locks you into its service after the promotion expires. To get around that, all you have to do is buy the phone directly from Apple. In that case, it will be unlocked, and you will be free to move to another provider at the end of the $1 promotion (or at any time, because Virgin does not lock people in with contracts). Aside from that, the only catch is that you have to pay taxes, which vary by market, but Virgin has not hidden that fact. This is actually a good deal that sets a new bar in the wireless industry. It's a bold move by Sprint, which is banking on the idea that after a year customers won't leave. That may not be true, but that's something shareholders, not consumers, should worry about.

    Top-Performing Tech Stocks of 2017 -- The Motley Fool

795,Selena Maranjian,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here's the bad news: The average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,365 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,687 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. Clearly, Social Security isn't going to give any of us a luxurious retirement. There's good news, though: There are many ways you can generate retirement income. It's smart to spend a little time figuring out how much money you'll need in retirement, and then planning how you can produce your needed cash flow. Here are a dozen strategies to consider. Image source: Getty Images. This one won't win a popularity contest, but it can be very effective. If you can work two or three more years than you originally planned to, your nest egg can grow while you put off starting to tap it. You might enjoy your employer-sponsored health insurance for a few more years, too, perhaps also while collecting a few more years' worth of matching funds in your 401(k). Here's what a difference this can make in your investing: Imagine that you sock away $10,000 per year for 20 years and it grows by an annual average of 8%, growing to about $494,000. If you can keep going for another three years, still averaging 8%, you'll end up with more than $657,000! That's more than $160,000 extra just for delaying retiring for a few years. Next, consider easing into full retirement instead of jumping in feet first. If you're willing and able to work a little in your first few years of retirement, you can generate some helpful income. Working just 12 hours per week at $10 per hour will generate about $500 per month. Better still, a part-time job can also give your days more structure and regular opportunities for socializing. Many retirees find themselves restless and a bit lonely in retirement, and a low-stress job on the side can be quite helpful. Here are some ideas of ways you might work in retirement: You could be a cashier at a local retailer or deliver newspapers. You might do some freelance writing or editing or graphic design work. You might tutor kids in subjects you know well, or perhaps give adults or kids music or language lessons. You might do some consulting -- perhaps even for your former employer. You could babysit, walk dogs, or take on some handy-person jobs. These days the Internet offers even more options. You might make jewelry, soaps, or sweaters, and sell them online. You might even just work part-time for your current employer. Image source: Getty Images. Think twice before entering retirement with a lot of credit card debt or other high-interest debt. When you're living on a reduced income, it will be extra hard to pay that off, and those payments can hurt your ability to make other necessary payments. It's a good idea to enter retirement mortgage-free, too, if you can, so that you don't have to make any mortgage payments and will only have to deal with insurance, taxes, and maintenance. This great retirement income strategy is only great at certain times -- when interest rates are meaningful. Right now if you park $100,000 in certificates of deposit paying 1.5% in interest, you'll collect $1,500 per year, hardly a helpful sum. Back in 1984, though, rates for five-year, one-year, and six-month CDs were in the double digits. If you could get 10% on a $100,000 investment, you'd enjoy $10,000 per year, equivalent to about $830 per month. Low interest rates not only deliver little income, but they also don't keep up with inflation. Bonds are another interest-paying option, but the safest ones (from the U.S. government) tend to pay modest interest rates, especially in low-interest-rate environments. Still, if you have a lot of money, you might make this strategy work by buying a variety of bonds that will mature at different times, generating income over many years. The more you contribute to tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s, the more money you'll have in retirement. There are two main kinds of IRA -- the Roth IRA and the traditional IRA -- and for both in 2017, the contribution limit is $5,500 for most people and $6,500 for those 50 and older. (Limits are occasionally increased, to keep up with inflation.) That might not seem like a lot of money, but it's quite powerful if it can grow for many years. The following table shows how much money you can accumulate with annual $5,500 contributions at different average annual rates of growth: $5,500 Invested Annually For: Growing at 6% Growing at 8% Growing at 10% 15 years $135,699 $161,284 $199,224 20 years $214460 $271,826 $346,514 25 years $319,860 $434,249 $595,000 30 years $460,909 $672,902 $995,189 Data source: Calculations by author. A 401(k) has much more generous contribution limits -- for 2017 it's $18,000 for most people and $24,000 for those 50 or older. Give particular consideration to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which are increasingly available, as they let you withdraw money in retirement tax-free! While some annuities, such as variable annuities and indexed annuities, can be quite problematic, often charging steep fees and sporting restrictive terms, fixed annuities are well worth considering. They're much simpler instruments, and they can start paying you immediately or on a deferred basis. Following are examples of the kind of income that various people might be able to secure in the form of an immediate fixed annuity in the current economic environment. (You'll generally be offered higher payments in times of higher prevailing interest rates.) Person/People Cost Monthly Income Annual Income Equivalent 65-year-old man $100,000 $545 $6,540 70-year-old man $100,000 $623 $7,476 70-year-old woman $100,000 $586 $7,032 65-year-old couple $200,000 $937 $11,244 70-year-old couple $200,000 $1,029 $12,348 75-year-old couple $200,000 $1,178 $14,136 Data source: immediateannuities.com. Annuities can provide much peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. A deferred annuity can also be smart, starting to pay you at a future point, such as when you turn a certain age. A 60-year-old man, for example, might spend $100,000 for an annuity that will start paying him $962 per month for the rest of his life beginning at age 70. That can remove any worries about running out of money late in life. You can generate income in retirement by selling off shares of stock from your stock portfolio over time -- but with dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares! A $300,000 portfolio, for example, that sports an overall average yield of 4% will generate about $12,000 per year -- a solid $1,000 per month. Dividend income isn't guaranteed, but if you spread your money across a bunch of healthy and growing companies, you'll probably receive regular -- and growing -- payments. Here are a few well-regarded stocks with significant dividend yields: Stock Recent Dividend Yield Ford Motor Company 5.4% Verizon Communications 5% Chevron 4.1% Pfizer 3.8% Cisco Systems 3.6% Data source: Yahoo! Financial. A dividend-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a fine option, too, offering instant diversification. The iShares Select Dividend ETF, for example, recently yielded about 3%. Preferred stock is another way to go. The iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF recently yielded 5.6%. Image source: Getty Images. Next, you might consider a reverse mortgage. It's essentially a loan secured by your home. A lender will provide (often tax-free) income during your retirement, and the loan doesn't have to be paid back until you no longer live in your home -- perhaps because you moved into a nursing home or died. It has some drawbacks, though, such as requiring your heirs to sell your home unless they can afford to pay off the loan, but if you're really pinched for funds and no one is counting on inheriting your home, it can be a solid solution. Another home-related retirement-income option is relocating. If you downsize and move to a smaller home -- or you move to a region with lower taxes or a lower cost of living -- you can end up spending less on taxes, insurance, home maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and so on. The median home value in California, for example, was recently about $386,000, but it was only $248,000 in Colorado and only $140,000 in South Carolina. Borrowing against your life insurance is another option. If you have a life insurance policy that no one is depending on -- such as if the children you meant to protect with it are now grown and independent -- you might consider borrowing against it. This can work if you've bought ""permanent"" insurance such as whole life or universal life, and not term life insurance, that generally only lasts as long as you're paying for it. You'll be reducing or wiping out the value of the policy with your withdrawal(s), but if no one really needs the ultimate payout, it can make sense. Plus, the income is typically tax-free. Image source: Getty Images. A little creative thinking can pay off well when it comes to retirement income, too. You may be able to come up with some ways to spend less and/or bring in more money. For example, you could spend less by quitting cable TV and just streaming your video entertainment -- that might save $50 you per month or $600 per year. If you're not using the gym much but are paying $40 monthly for it, that's another $500 or so in potential annual savings. Believe it or not, you might save hundreds of dollars just by spending an hour on the phone calling insurance companies to get the best current deal on your home insurance and car insurance. Eating out less and having friends over to play games or watch movies can save on dining and entertainment expenses. If you smoke, you can probably save thousands of dollars per year by quitting -- and you might lengthen your life, too! To bring more moola in, you might rent out a room now and then via Airbnb, or even take in a boarder for a year or two. If you're not already using cash-back or rewards credit cards, look into them. If you charge about $1,200 per month on credit cards and earn 2% back, on average, you're looking at close to $300 in cash back per year. Clear out your basement, attic, and/or garage by selling things online or via a yard sale and you might net hundreds of dollars. Or take an easier route and donate clothes and household items to charity, reaping tax deductions. You could make things to sell online, too, such as soaps, furniture, or jewelry. Reducing your household's automotive fleet by one vehicle can save a lot in insurance and upkeep, too. Finally, learn more about Social Security strategies. Just as there are many ways to boost your retirement income, there are a bunch of ways to boost your Social Security income, as well. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. If you and your spouse have very different earnings records, for example, you might start collecting the benefits of the spouse with the lower lifetime earnings record on time or early, while delaying starting to collect the benefits of the higher-earning spouse. That way, you both get to enjoy some income earlier, and when the higher earner hits 70, you can collect their extra-large checks. Also, should that higher-earning spouse die first, the spouse with the smaller earnings history can collect those bigger benefit checks. ","

Well, that didn't take long. Only one month after activist investor Keith Meister suggested that Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT) CEO Jeff Storey become CEO of CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) after the two companies merge and a period of integration passes, CenturyLink came out with a press release saying it would be so. Prior to the announcement, Storey was set to join the board, but not become an executive, and CenturyLink CEO Glenn Post was to remain CEO. Under the new succession plan, Post will remain CEO of CenturyLink in the wake of the merger while Storey comes on board as president and chief operating officer. On Jan. 1, 2019, Storey will take over as CEO and Post will become executive chairman of the company's board of directors. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30. Activist investors don't always get what they want so easily. For instance, David Einhorn's recent campaign for General Motors to split its shares into two classes of stock was met with fierce resistance from the company and shareholders alike. In contrast to that plan, which was somewhat complicated, Meister's suggestion was both very simple and also made a lot of sense. Here's why shareholders should embrace the plan. Image source: Getty Images. Prior to the planned merger, CenturyLink's various businesses were half ""strategic,"" or growth businesses worthy of investment, such as high-speed ethernet, and half ""legacy,"" or businesses experiencing a decline in their life cycle, such as landline phone services. CenturyLink's customer composition is roughly one-third consumer-facing, and two-thirds business-facing. Level 3 is solely geared toward business clients, and post-merger, the company will be more focused on serving large enterprise customers. The combined company will become the second-largest enterprise communications provider behind only AT&T, and ahead of Verizon. Given that Level 3 is 100% business-oriented and the merged company will be geared toward large business customers, it makes sense that Level 3's leadership should have a bigger voice going forward. Perhaps the most important reason for Storey to become CEO is the terrific track record he has achieved at Level 3 since becoming CEO in 2013. The stock price chart for CenturyLink and Level 3 over that time period tells the story quite well. CTL data by YCharts Storey was able to execute a turnaround at Level 3 by focusing on new ethernet, security, and cloud services opportunities, which enhanced profitability. Under his watch, EBITDA margins expanded from the high teens to the low 30s in just four years. As Meister put it, these are Tom Brady-like results. Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Schemke, who applauded the decision, also noted, ""At LVLT (and at WilTel Communications) Storey had success integrating acquisitions, developing deep sales teams, and identifying the key elements of corporations' communications infrastructure needs."" Schemke also pointed to Level 3's having matched or beaten earnings expectations for 11 straight quarters. This is in contrast to CenturyLink, which has missed estimates in recent quarters. As I've previously discussed, the merger and integration of the two companies is crucial, and could precipitate a turnaround at CenturyLink, which sports a hefty 8.3% dividend yield and whose shares have lagged the market over the past year. The new succession plan gives the turnaround a much better chance of being successful, and should be welcomed by shareholders. While CenturyLink's stock surged on the news, the stock remains well below Meister's $34 target price. ","
      
    CenturyLink's New Succession Plan Is Very Good News for Shareholders -- The Motley Fool

797,24/7 Wall St.,6292017,MarketWatch,6222017,"Published: June 27, 2017 7:15 a.m. ET By Investors love dividends. Whether the market is up or down, many investors need those dividends to help pay income in retirement. Dividends also account for up to half of all shareholder returns through time. While high dividends are desirable for investors, savvy investors know that not all dividends are created equal. 24/7 Wall St. has conducted a review of the top dividends from America’s largest companies. Almost all the companies should be recognizable to most Americans. It turns out that there were 25 large companies paying a yield of 3.5% or more — and some much higher. The reason that the 3.5% dividend yield matters so much to equity investors is that this is 1% higher than the average yields of the S&amp;P and Dow. This was also more than 100 basis points higher than the average yield of the 10-year to 30-year Treasury. The volatile dividends for real estate investment trusts (REITs) were excluded, while the safer dividends from utilities and other sectors were included. Much of the retail segment’s high dividend yields may have a similar set of caveats, and they may feel driven by lower and lower share prices. As of the last week of June 2017, the average S&amp;P 500 Index yield was 2.37% and the average yield of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks was 2.43%. The huge difference between the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 is that all Dow stocks currently pay dividends — while there were close to 80 non–dividend payers in the S&amp;P 500, and the index includes the higher-yielding REITs. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at just 2.13% and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was just 2.70%. The difference between the Treasury yields and equity yields is that the former are locked. Many of these major dividend paying companies should grow their revenue and earnings in the years ahead, and investors assume dividend and earnings growth in future years also will translate to higher share prices. 24/7 Wall St. used data from Thomson Reuters on financials and on target prices, and some extra color and commentary on what has driven these high yields also has been provided. The consensus analyst share price targets from Thomson Reuters have been used to show whether Wall Street thinks each company’s stock has room to appreciate or if they think there is already a fair value. Here are 25 great American companies paying dividends that 3.5% yield or greater. Macy's &gt; Yield: 6.78% &gt; Price: $22.46 &gt; Mean price target: $25.79 &gt; 52-week range: $21.51 to $45.41 &gt; Market cap: $6.8 billion Macy’s Inc. (NYSE: M) has the highest dividend yield of major retailers at this time. Its stock also has been brutalized by the growth of Amazon, and Macy’s has been unable to turn its own omni-channel up enough to offset in-store sale erosion. Its yield was already high a year ago, but the big dividend yield growth for new investors has been due to the pain of a falling stock price for existing shareholders. Macy’s is also pursuing more store closures to focus on the most profitable locations. At the start of 2017, Macy’s had almost 150,000 employees and operated about 830 stores under the Macys, Bloomingdales, Bloomingdales The Outlet, Macys Backstage and Bluemercury banners. Kohl's &gt; Yield: 5.94% &gt; Price: $37.38 &gt; Mean price target: $40.52 &gt; 52-week range: $35.16 to $59.67 &gt; Market cap: $6.4 billion Kohl’s Corp. (NYSE: KSS) has faced many of the same issues as Macy’s, including the rise of Amazon and e-commerce. As of January 28, 2017, Kohl’s operated 1,154 department stores, 12 FILA outlets and another three Off-Aisle clearance centers.

It operates globally and dominates in storage devices, with a focus on hard drives, solid state drives and portable drives. Ford &gt; Yield: 5.43% &gt; Price: $11.10 &gt; Mean price target: $12.80 &gt; 52-week range: $10.67 to $14.04 &gt; Market cap: $44.2 billion Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) has a better dividend than a stock performance of late. It has struggled to find direction in the post-Mulally years and is soon to have a new chief executive. At the same time, Ford has been experiencing a peak-auto trend in the United States as it seems hard to imagine the 2016 sales cycle being as robust in the year and years ahead. Staples &gt; Yield: 5.17% &gt; Price: $9.19 &gt; Mean price target: $9.80 &gt; 52-week range: $7.24 to $10.25 &gt; Market cap: $6.0 billion Staples Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLS) is the king of all independent retailers of office supplies. That being said, it is under a relatively new leadership now that its acquisition of rival Office Depot failed to get approved. Staples has been a rumored buyout candidate of its own, but it also faces the Amazon and small e-commerce impact that has been a challenge to much of the retail landscape. AT&amp;T &gt; Yield: 5.16% &gt; Price: $38.13 &gt; Mean price target: $39.68 &gt; 52-week range: $36.10 to $43.89 &gt; Market cap: $234.4 billion AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T) is still the king of major telecom dividends, but its lead over Verizon has come in. AT&amp;T has already diversified with its acquisition of DirecTV, and it is further trying to diversify with the pending acquisition of Time Warner to further spread into cable, telecom and content. AT&amp;T’s revenue was almost $164 billion in 2016. Verizon &gt; Yield: 5.09% &gt; Price: $45.81 &gt; Mean price target: $50.05 &gt; 52-week range: $44.46 to $56.95 &gt; Market cap: $186.9 billion Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has the highest yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company has so far been less of an acquirer than rival AT&amp;T, but it has now acquired AOL and Yahoo and plans to grow its video and ad platforms. Its revenue was $126 billion in 2016. Occidental Petroleum &gt; Yield: 5.06% &gt; Price: $60.24 &gt; Mean price target: $71.44 &gt; 52-week range: $57.20 to $78.48 &gt; Market cap: $46.1 billion Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) is not the largest of the oil companies in raw market value, but it is the largest oil and gas dividend of the integrated players. Some of that dividend boost is because its shares are way down from the highs, and a weak oil market might be a continued risk to Occidental and all oil and gas players. Occidental’s 2016 revenue of $10 billion was almost half of the revenues just two years earlier. FirstEnergy &gt; Yield: 4.98% &gt; Price: $30.04 &gt; Mean price target: $33.53 &gt; 52-week range: $27.93 to $36.60 &gt; Market cap: $13.3 billion FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) is an electricity utility and generator via coal-fired, nuclear, hydroelectric, oil and natural gas, wind and solar power generating facilities. The company serves approximately 6 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Target &gt; Yield: 4.89% &gt; Price: $51.45 &gt; Mean price target: $58.12 &gt; 52-week range: $48.56 to $79.33 &gt; Market cap: $28.4 billion Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) is in the middle of a tight retail market, wedged somewhere between the cross-hairs of Walmart and Amazon. The drop in Target’s shares has been far worse than rival Walmart, and that has helped to drive up the dividend. Despite having revenue of $69.5 billion in 2016, that is down from almost $74 billion the prior year. Southern Company &gt; Yield: 4.65% &gt; Price: $50.17 &gt; Mean price target: $51.16 &gt; 52-week range: $46.20 to $54.64 &gt; Market cap: $49.9 billion Southern Co. (NYSE: SO) is another electric utility and has power generation assets, sells wholesale electricity and distributes natural gas. Southern is based in Atlanta and claims roughly 9 million customers spread over electric and natural gas. Its 11 regulated utility markets are in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and several more states. General Motors &gt; Yield: 4.44% &gt; Price: $34.29 &gt; Mean price target: $39.50 &gt; 52-week range: $27.34 to $38.55 &gt; Market cap: $51.8 billion General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) might be its own company again since its notorious bankruptcy and re-emergence as a public company. The stock also has been pretty much a nothing-burger since that IPO, and just like rival Ford, GM faces tough comparisons for a peak U.S. auto trend. Still, GM has been unwinding some money-losing and less profitable efforts in Europe. Entergy &gt; Yield: 4.41% &gt; Price: $79.60 &gt; Mean price target: $78.69 &gt; 52-week range: $66.71 to $82.09 &gt; Market cap: $14.3 billion Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) is an electric utility based in New Orleans. It serves portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans. It distributes natural gas and delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers. Overall Entergy is one of the big players among utilities in the deep south. Although it operates through several different subsidiaries, it has over 14,000 employees. The stock has made steady gains over the past few years, and it is actually closing in on an all-time high — with a dividend like this, that says something. Valero Energy &gt; Yield: 4.24% &gt; Price: $66.28 &gt; Mean price target: $73.89 &gt; 52-week range: $46.88 to $71.40 &gt; Market cap: $29.6 billion Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) is a top petroleum refiner and ethanol producer in the country, and its stock can be volatile around the swings in oil pricing and also around how the refining sector’s margins grow and contract. Its revenue of more than $75 billion in 2016 is down handily from prior years, but much of that is price-driven by commodity prices rather than its raw profitability. Unlike traditional oil companies, refining companies do not thrive as well under high oil prices as the margins are tougher. As of December 31, 2016, the company owned 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.1 million barrels per day, and it owned and operated 11 ethanol plants with a combined capacity of approximately 1.4 billion gallons per year. Gap &gt; Yield: 4.19% &gt; Price: $22.27 &gt; Mean price target: $25.53 &gt; 52-week range: $19.33 to $30.74 &gt; Market cap: $8.8 billion Gap Inc. (GPS) has become a post-growth retailer after prior decades of expansion, and it is facing many of the same Amazon-related and e-commerce pressure of other retailers. The company has consolidated many stores under the namesake Gap brand, and it has Old Navy and Banana Republic brands. Gap also owns Athleta and Intermix. As of March 14, 2017, the company operated 3,200 company-operated stores and 450 franchise stores. Gap’s revenue of $15.5 billion in 2016 was the third straight year of decline and its pretax net income of $1.12 billion in 2016 was down from over $2 billion in 2014 and 2013. Williams Companies &gt; Yield: 4.17% &gt; Price: $28.81 &gt; Mean price target: $33.37 &gt; 52-week range: $19.60 to $32.69 &gt; Market cap: $23.8 billion Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE: WMB) is an energy infrastructure company that operates oil and gas pipelines. Its primary natural gas pipeline system extends from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the offshore Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. Other pipelines cover parts of the central and western states. The Tulsa-based company dates back to 1908. Chevron &gt; Yield: 4.11% &gt; Price: $104.42 &gt; Mean price target: $122.48 &gt; 52-week range: $97.53 to $119.00 &gt; Market cap: $197.8 billion Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) may not be the size in market cap of rival Exxon Mobil, but it outyields its larger rival. Chevron has seen its ups and downs with the price of oil, but it has pledged to not disrupt its dividend unless it simply faces no other serious alternatives. Revenues of $110 billion in 2016 were down from $200 billion just two years earlier. PPL &gt; Yield: 4.07% &gt; Price: $39.34 &gt; Mean price target: $38.96 &gt; 52-week range: $32.08 to $40.20 &gt; Market cap: $26.9 billion PPL Corp. (NYSE: PPL) is an electric utility based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and its three operating units are U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated and Pennsylvania Regulated. The company dates back to 1920, and it claims to have more than 10 million utility customers in the United States and United Kingdom. Qualcomm &gt; Yield: 4.01% &gt; Price: $56.51 &gt; Mean price target: $61.55 &gt; 52-week range: $50.84 to $71.62 &gt; Market cap: $83.5 billion Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been the king of processors in the mobile phone and tablet arena. Its growth recently ran into some headwinds as customers such as Apple have chosen to in-house or go to cheaper rivals, and the company also has had royalty disputes. Now Qualcomm is hoping to bolster its growth and diversify its revenues away from just expensive microprocessors with the acquisition of a much more diversified NXP Semiconductors in a deal valued at close to $40 billion. Duke Energy &gt; Yield: 3.98% &gt; Price: $86.80 &gt; Mean price target: $84.75 &gt; 52-week range: $72.34 to $87.75 &gt; Market cap: $60.8 billion Duke Energy Corp. (NYSE: DUK) is easily one of the largest utility providers with a portfolio that covers the east coast through the Midwest. This company is more or less the gold standard when it comes to utility stocks, and many of the stocks within the industry take their bearings from it. Although utilities are known for trading on their dividends, Duke has made a noteworthy run so far this year. IBM &gt; Yield: 3.89% &gt; Price: $155.16 &gt; Mean price target: $165.07 &gt; 52-week range: $142.50 to $182.79 &gt; Market cap: $145.8 billion International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) has been a large buyback and dividend payer for years, but the company had to abandon part of its artificial earnings per share growth efforts. IBM has been growing in its emerging opportunities in cloud, Watson and other efforts, but its legacy IT-consulting operations have been bleeding off faster than IBM can grow its emerging tech businesses. The company still has around 380,000 employees. A slew of earnings disappointments has been a thorn in its side, and IBM may need new leadership quite soon if it cannot get that turnaround underway. Its revenue was almost $80 billion in 2016 and was down each year consecutively since at least 2012. Exxon Mobil &gt; Yield: 3.77% &gt; Price: $81.33 &gt; Mean price target: $87.13 &gt; 52-week range: $79.26 to $95.55 &gt; Market cap: $344.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) shares have suffered with the fate of oil prices, and its massive $31 billion acquisition of XTO Energy for natural gas was done at a time that the economics of today’s energy prices haven’t been so great. Exxon’s 2016 revenues of over $218 billion were down from $394 billion in 2014 and were half of the $451 billion in 2012. At least Exxon gets to claim that its former CEO became Secretary of State. Pfizer &gt; Yield: 3.75% &gt; Price: $34.07 &gt; Mean price target: $37.35 &gt; 52-week range: $29.83 to $37.93 &gt; Market cap: $203.3 billion Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) has struggled to find growth for years. Its drugs have faced the same patent cliff of much of Big Pharma rivals. Still, its dividend is deemed safe by investors, and 2016 revenues of $52.8 billion bumped up from the average of the prior three years. Cisco Systems &gt; Yield: 3.61% &gt; Price: $32.31 &gt; Mean price target: $35.43 &gt; 52-week range: $27.13 to $34.60 &gt; Market cap: $161.5 billion Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) has been one of the top technology companies in networking. It has made hundreds of small bolt-on acquisitions around future technology, and Cisco hopes that security integration can help bolster its sales ahead. Long-time CEO John Chambers has turned the helm over to Chuck Robbins, and Cisco has been in the midst of two large restructurings in the past five years in an effort to ""right-size"" its headcount and unit structure. Cisco’s revenue was $37 billion in 2016, and it has been stable but choppy over the past five years, but without any real growth. Cisco shares also remain well down from the tech bubble days back in 1999 to 2000. Exelon &gt; Yield: 3.59% &gt; Price: $37.34 &gt; Mean price target: $39.47 &gt; 52-week range: $29.82 to $37.70 &gt; Market cap: $34.6 billion Exelon Corp.

798,,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. The sale represents Verizon’s efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. For Equinix, the world’s biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. “We’ve been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,” Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts. The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix’s total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon. Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading. ","

799,,12082016,Reuters,12012016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of Asia’s biggest technology companies said they were looking to expand investment in the United States, as President-elect Donald Trump pushes to bring manufacturing and jobs back home. Son said on Tuesday, after meeting Trump, his investment would create 50,000 new jobs, a move the U.S. President-elect claimed was a direct result of his election win. The lack of details on the investment timetable also prompted doubts on whether the promise of money and jobs will be met, as Sprint is slashing staff numbers to cut more than $2 billion in costs this fiscal year. Trump’s moves since the election to engage with individual companies, while turning his back on broader, years-in-the-works trade deals, show that he is leaning on the deal-making skills he honed in the boardroom. Trump campaigned against the over-regulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama. The $50 billion investment, announced jointly by Trump and Son in the lobby of the Trump Tower in Manhattan, would come from the $100 billion tech investment fund the head of SoftBank is setting up with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and he’s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,” Trump said. “He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!” Trump later Tweeted. Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth, would create the jobs by investing in startup companies. He also said he expected a lot of “deregulation” under a Trump administration. Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump’s four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration. The page also showed an additional $7 billion investment and creation of a further 50,000 jobs. (cnb.cx/2he38VQ) “While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials,” the Foxconn statement said. Son and Foxconn founder Terry Gou are considered close and have several business ventures together, including launching humanoid Pepper - which is manufactured by Foxconn - into several markets, and investing jointly in India. Foxconn has manufacturing facilities in the U.S. states of Virginia and Indiana, according to its website (here). Its 2015 annual report also listed logistics services in California and Texas. In October, prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the $100 billion tech fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Shares in SoftBank jumped 6.2 percent on Wednesday in Tokyo to their highest since August last year. “Now the market sees SoftBank as a Trump-related stock and that’s because it reacted favorably to their meeting,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a fund manager at Dalton Capital in Japan. Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son’s comments. They closed up 1.5 percent, while shares of T-Mobile US rose 1.8 percent. It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank’s investment had been disclosed before. SoftBank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt. Whether or not Trump’s election led to SoftBank’s planned investment, the billionaire’s victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote. Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world’s largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Back in 2011, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) seemed like a fading player in the wireless subscription business. The duopoly of Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) owned 65% of the market, while T-Mobile came in a distant fourth place, with just 11% of the market. Times, however, have changed. Revitalized by CEO John Legere's ""Uncarrier"" plan that has expanded to include a wide number of initiatives, the company has grown to capture almost 17% of the market. While Verizon remains the top dog, with 35% of wireless subscriptions nationwide, such a drastic improvement leads to a simple question: Is T-Mobile's stock a better buy at today's prices? There's no definitive way to answer that, but there are three different lenses through which we can answer the question. Cash in the bank is awfully boring. But it's incredibly important. That's because every business -- at some point in time -- will run into rough patches. Whether they be company-specific or macro in nature, those with lots of cash on hand will be rewarded with optionality. Those with lots of debt, on the other hand, won't be so lucky. They will have to narrow their focus to just making ends meet to stay out of bankruptcy. The telecom industry requires heavy debt levels to maintain the enormous infrastructure required to meet our data demands, but we can still investigate where breathing room may exist. Here's how Verizon and T-Mobile stack up in terms of financial fortitude. Company Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Verizon $7.6 billion $103 billion $14 billion $11.5 billion T-Mobile $6.2 billion $21.8 billion $1.4 billion $1.5 billion Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes long and short-term investments. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis. It's important to point out that Verizon is valued at roughly four-and-a-half times the size of T-Mobile. Given that, I can't help but give the nod here to T-Mobile. In terms of a cash-to-debt position, T-Mobile clearly has the upper hand -- with a somewhat comparable level of cash but only one-fifth the debt level. Of course, much of the debt that Verizon has is because the company bought out the stake that Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD) had in Verizon Wireless -- a critically important piece of Verizon's overall empire. But we'll get to the benefits that this bestows on shareholders in the next section. Often referred to as a ""moat"" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are perhaps the most important metric for any investor to consider. Evaluating a moat is part art, part science. In essence, the moat is the special sauce that makes a company what it is -- and differentiates it from all of the other players in the industry. Both T-Mobile and Verizon are beneficiaries of high barriers to entrance. In short, we don't see a lot of start-ups popping up to vie for your mobile subscription dollars. That's because it's prohibitively expensive to build out data networks. Verizon's moat is provided by the company's top spot within the industry. With 35% of all wireless subscriptions, and a fairly low churn rate, the company is able to rake in tons of free cash flow every month. It has also expanded beyond wireless service to become an Internet provider (FiOS), and it owns AOL's properties -- and will soon own Yahoo!'s operating business. It's yet to be seen exactly how these acquisitions will play out. T-Mobile, on the other hand, has the advantage of being a first-mover in the no-contract plans among the country's biggest players. Legere, in effect, is doubling down on convenience and customer service, saying, ""We're so much better than the others, we'll give our customers the choice to leave, and they still won't."" Of course, Legere has come up with other ways to keep customers around -- equipment installment plans or promotions tied to monthly bill credits -- but the bottom line is that the strategy has served as an important differentiator. The strategy has paid off thus far, but it's worth stating that Verizon and AT&T have already started offering much the same deal, and it may erode T-Mobile's advantage over time. In addition, we are already seeing Verizon move beyond simply being a wireless carrier and into a fully fledged media and content company -- via the aforementioned Yahoo and AOL tie-ups. That's something that T-Mobile simply can't compete with at this point -- from a cash, cash flow, or acquisition standpoint. Finally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is. Company P/E P/FCF P/S PEG Ratio Verizon 13 18 1.6 4.2 T-Mobile 35 29 1.3 0.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade, Morningstar. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings. Normally, that would make me give the nod to T-Mobile. However, there's one extra variable to consider: the dividend. Verizon has a healthy and sustainable 4.5% yield, while T-Mobile has none to speak of. Given that, I'm siding with Verizon, here. So, there you have it. If I had to boil this down to one sentence, it would be this: T-Mobile has better growth prospects, but Verizon is the safer bet and offers a dividend. Truth be told, both are probably worthy of your consideration, but for those seeking income via dividends, Verizon is the obvious choice. ","

Image source: Getty Images. For those looking to pad their retirement accounts with solid dividend payers, the sight of Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) dividend seems too good to be true. A 4.5% yield from an industry leader trading for a 50% discount to the broader market? Yes, please! But as you'll see below, it's worth digging in to see if all that glitters really is gold before putting your hard-earned cash behind the company. For dividend investors, the most important thing to continually evaluate is a company's free cash flow (FCF) statement. This represents the amount of cash an organization can put in its pocket by running its business, minus any capital expenditures. At the end of the day, it is from FCF that healthy companies pay their dividends -- and as the FCF trends change, so too do a company's dividend policies. This is where I ran into something somewhat concerning. Over the past 12 months, Verizon has brought in $11.5 billion in FCF. There's nothing wrong with that. But in order to pay its dividend, the company used 80% of FCF. While that's technically sustainable, it raises two red flags: (1) If the company meets tough times, maintaining the dividend may be difficult, and (2) even if it doesn't encounter difficulties, Verizon may not be able to grow its dividend substantially moving forward. But by digging deeper, we can see this might be a bit more of an anomaly than a trend. In June of this year, Verizon ratified its collective bargaining agreement with employees. Because of that, Verizon ""recorded ... charges of approximately $3.6 billion."" That's a huge one-time charge, and it showed up in the company's bottom line and on the FCF statement. While it's definitely important to note such a big charge, it's also worth asking if this is something that long-term investors should really be worried about. To get a better idea of the trends at Verizon, I suggest investors back up and look at the company's history of FCF and dividend payments over the past decade. When we do that, here's what we see: Data source: SEC filings. Viewed through this lens, there are a couple of things that stand out. First, while the trend is certainly not linear, FCF has undoubtedly trended upwards over the past decade -- increasing an average of 12% per year. Second, the dividend is historically very safe, with 2005 being the only year where the payout ratio from FCF eclipsed even 65%. The bottom line: Verizon's dividend is pretty safe. Before giving my full-fledged support to Verizon, there are a few other caveats worth considering. First and foremost, while the company is the largest mobile provider in America, the telecom landscape is not what it used to be. Verizon, sensing that disruption and innovation are rampant in today's technological setting, has branched out into other lines of business. That's evident through the company's acquisition of AOL and the announced plan to buy Yahoo!'s core operating business. I wouldn't be surprised to see the company continue to trend toward other strategic initiatives. What investors need to watch is whether or not those moves materially affect Verizon's cash flow statement. If they do, then there may be cause for concern regarding the company's dividend. If not, however, I have no problem endorsing Verizon's fat 4.5% payout as a safe and sustainable one. ","

Telecommunications giant Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has reached an agreement with Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) to sell two dozen data center sites for a total of $3.6 billion. Included in those sites are 29 data center buildings located within 15 major metropolitan areas. Along with the data centers, Equinix will be acquiring roughly 900 customers and 250 new employees from Verizon, including many new enterprise customers. After closing, Equinix will have a total of 175 data centers across 43 markets, covering 17 million gross square feet of data center space around the world. The deal is expected to close by the middle of next year. For Equinix, the deal will expand its global reach and strengthen its interconnections in the U.S. and Latin America while growing its exposure to enterprise and government markets. For instance, the Network Access Point in Miami is an especially important interconnection point for Latin America. Existing customers will also benefit from the larger platform's scale. Equinix said on a conference call with analysts that it had been considering these assets for some time. Verizon had previously acquired Terremark Worldwide in 2011 for $1.4 billion, expanding its own data center operations, but has since shifted its focus toward media- and content-related deals. The company had reportedly been trying all year to sell these data center assets, a continuation of recent physical asset sales. Speaking at an investor conference this morning, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said that the company lacked scale in data centers, so it preferred to sell the assets in order to better deploy the capital.

Image source: Netflix. Donald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory. However, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes. Netflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, ""We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points."" Netflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of ""crony capitalism."" Though net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes. In February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to ""preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.  The Open Internet platform above all prohibits blocking access to websites, throttling traffic, or accepting payment to favor one content source over another. Telecoms like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have fought the regulations in the past, and an appeals court struck down portions of a former net neutrality bill in 2014. If Trump's FCC rolls back net neutrality, it could have a number of consequences for Netflix, other streamers like Hulu and Amazon Prime, and small, independent content providers that may be unable to afford higher fees that ISPs could charge for better service. The most likely outcome of the unraveling of net neutrality is that prices for consumers will go up as ISPs could charge extra fees to carry streams from bandwidth hogs like Netflix. Stricter data caps could also apply to mobile devices, making it harder to use such services away from home. The biggest threat to Netflix, however, could be cable providers giving so-called ""fast lane"" treatment to their own services, as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could do for its Stream service. The end of net neutrality would also give additional leverage to a combined AT&T (NYSE:T)-Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), as AT&T could use its Pay TV services like DirecTV and U-Verse to give preferential treatment to HBO and the Turner cable networks owned by Time Warner. While rolling back net neutrality would be a challenge for content providers like Netflix, it would be a boon for cable and internet service providers, whose stocks have gained since the election. NFLX data by YCharts. The net neutrality development comes at a time when communities are already toying with the idea of a ""Netflix tax"" or a surcharge on streaming services that treats them like a utility. Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality. ","

Image source: Getty. Buying telecom stocks probably seems like a fairly straightforward exercise. Due to the industry's relative stability, some investors regard telecommunications companies as similar to utilities, a sleepy and staid industry if ever there was one. In reality, though, investing in telecom stocks isn't nearly as clear-cut as it might seem. In this two-part article, we will examine a host of key business and financial metrics that investors need to consider before actually investing in any telecom stock. Image source: Author. If you read through any telecom company's annual report, you're guaranteed to come across the commonly used metric ""churn rate."" The term simply refers to the number of subscribers that leave their service over a given period of time, as a percentage of total subscribers. The number isn't unique to the telecom industry, though; churn rates are often measured in sectors that use subscription-based business models, like the cable-TV industry. The lower the churn rate, the better, since customer defections act as a headwind to revenue growth and profit margins. Telecom companies disclose their churn rates in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Sprint (NYSE:S) have each maintained churn rates of between 1% and 2% over the past year. As the U.S. smartphone market matures, telecom companies are increasingly attempting to grow by courting one another's customers. This has led to a minor rise in churn rates in recent quarters, though they are unlikely to spike appreciably beyond their current range. Investors researching telecom stocks will certainly want to closely monitor this crucial metric. Perhaps the second most commonly discussed performance metric in the telecom industry is average revenue per user, or ARPU. Just as it sounds, this measures the typical revenue garnered from one customer. Telecom companies closely monitor this metric to help shape their near-term and long-term growth strategies. Growing ARPU can prove particularly lucrative for telecom companies, since applying new revenue-growth strategies to current users flows directly to the bottom lines. The general ARPU trend among U.S. telecom carriers has largely been downward over the past several years, the result of continued price competition among the four main industry leaders. Sprint and T-Mobile have aggressively slashed prices and added other incentives to court customers away from AT&T and Verizon. However, in response, AT&T and Verizon have both expanded the breadth of their product offerings -- AT&T bought DIRECTV, and Verizon acquired AOL and Yahoo! -- to further monetize their customer bases. Telecom companies also track subscriber metrics including Average Billings Per User, Average Revenue Per Account, and Average Billings Per Account, which generally attempt to provide the same kind of user-level insight into a company's revenue-generation capabilities. Either way, anyone considering investing in a telecom stock should review the company's ARPU and its general direction to gain a better sense of the business's overall health. As you can see, each of the four major U.S. telecom operations offers a reasonably strong network, with AT&T and Sprint suffering from relatively slower upload speeds. This picture changes from region to region, and from urban to rural environments. Furthermore, with each telecom already testing 5G -- the next evolution for wireless standards -- their differences in network quality are certain to change throughout the latter half of the decade. Telecom companies have historically been strong dividend stocks. As just one example, the sector's 4.2% average dividend yield is more than double the S&P 500's 2% payout. Though the sector overall has a high average yield, there are divergences between companies in the sector. Here's how the four largest telecom stocks vary by dividend policy: Company Name Dividend Yield No. Consecutive Annual Dividend Increases AT&T 5.3% 31 Verizon Communications 4.9% 9 Sprint N/A N/A T-Mobile US N/A N/A Data sources: Dividend.com and Google Finance. As you'll see in future sections, a telecom company's dividend policy often reflects its current financing circumstances. For example, Frontier Communications' 13.2% dividend yield reflects the heightened long-term risk that comes with its legacy landline strategy, which many investors expect to gradually erode in the coming years. On the other end of the spectrum, Sprint and T-Mobile intentionally avoid paying dividends in favor of investing all their excess cash into improving their wireless networks, in hopes of stealing subscribers from AT&T and Verizon. Taking the time to understand the reasons a telecom firm pursues its dividend policy can absolutely save you from a costly investment mistake. The telecom industry is notably capital-intensive. In order to provide a competitive network, telecommunications companies have to invest extensively in a wide range of fixed assets. As such, telecom operators often tap debt markets to fund a large part of their operations. The industry's subscription model -- in which cash flows tend to be fairly consistent -- also supports the use of leverage. As such, investors need to dig into a telecom company's balance sheet as part of their due diligence. A number of common balance-sheet ratios can prove extremely useful here. Investors can look at a company's debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, net cash, and debt as a percentage of invested capital. Used together, these and other balance-sheet ratios can give you a view into a company's long-term financial viability. Think you're getting the hang of analyzing telecom stocks?

Image source: Getty Images. In Part 1 of this article series on honing your abilities to analyze telecom stocks, we discussed the first five points investors need to understand as part of their research process. To recap, investors should understand important industry metrics such as churn and ARPU, examine the network quality of the company and its relevant competitors, research the dividend policy, and review its capital structure -- all before buying a telecom stock. Now let's consider five additional items for investors to consider. Image source: author. Spectrum rights are the lifeblood of modern mobile networks. Similar to how radio stations own the rights to broadcast over a certain frequency and geography, telecom companies own the rights to similar frequencies of radio waves that we simply refer to as spectrum. So it only makes sense that a telecom investor should have a basic understanding of a wireless provider's spectrum holdings. The good news is, that's fairly easy to do. Telecom operators provide information about their spectrum holdings and lease arrangements in their annual reports. If you're interested in a certain geographic area, the Federal Communications Commission maintains a website detailing which wireless companies own the rights to various spectrum frequencies. Telecom companies throw off gobs of cash, thanks to their relatively stable, subscription-based business models. As discussed in this article's companion piece, building and maintaining a competitive wireless network requires substantial capital expenditures, which can erode those free cash flows. The differences between providers on these matters can be eye-opening. For example, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) enjoy subscriber bases roughly twice the size of Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), and the tremendous difference shines through in terms their cash flow generation. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash flow from operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital expenditures $19.2 billion $17.7 billion $7.0 billion $4.7 billion Free cash flow from operations $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending March 31, 2016. Though much has been made of T-Mobile's and Sprint's recent challenges to AT&T and Verizon, this chart reveals the extent of the financial differences among U.S. wireless providers. This sizable difference in cash flow generation gives AT&T and Verizon far more flexibility to invest in future growth drivers (see below). They can more easily spend more on marketing, promotional pricing, and other measures to fend off their resurgent competitors. In fact, I maintain that this chart provides one of most useful ways to frame the competitive landscape in the U.S. telecom market. Any investor looking at this market needs to examine the stock in question in a similar manner before buying. As many smartphone markets in developed countries mature, revenue growth strategies are evolving at most telecoms in ways investors need to understand. For example, T-Mobile and Sprint remain the underdogs in the U.S. wireless market. To try to close that cash flow generation gap, both parties remain focused on growing their 4G wireless subscribers through a mix of marketing and price competition; T-Mobile's ""Un-carrier"" campaign is perhaps the best example. Image source: T-Mobile. However, in terms of their free cash flow advantages, AT&T and Verizon have instead pursued M&A strategies that should allow them to grow ARPU, albeit in different ways. Verizon has made a bet on building out its mobile advertising business by spending roughly $9 billion to acquire content and ad-tech powers AOL and Yahoo! over the past two years. AT&T, on the other hand, is moving to fashion itself into a one-stop shop for mobile connectivity and video programming through its purchase of DIRECTV and its proposed Time Warner buyout. Since it takes money to make money, investors need to understand a company's upcoming investment plans before buying. As was the case with their spectrum holdings, wireless providers typically offer some information on their near-term investment plans in their SEC filings. For example, AT&T's annual report states, ""We expect our 2016 capital investment, which includes our capital expenditures plus vendor financing payments related to our Mexico network, for our existing businesses to be in the $22,000 range, and we expect our capital investment to be in the 15 percent range of service revenues or lower from 2016 through 2018."" Finding this information doesn't have to take a lot of time -- I found it from a quick search. As with all good investing, it's critical to understand the cast of characters at the helm of a company. In fact, finding companies run by strong managers is one of the bedrocks of the Fool's primer on how to buy stocks. Among U.S. wireless providers, this is a fairly easy process, as the four largest wireless providers in the country are run by a well-known set of executives: Randall Stephenson  at AT&T, Lowell McAdam at Verizon, John Legere at T-Mobile, and Marcelo Claure at Sprint. A quick search can reveal the background information for the executive team and board of directors of a company that interests you. Furthermore, companies are required to publish their executive compensation plans in their annual proxy filings, which you can find on the investor-relations page of a company's website. Successfully buying telecom stocks requires quite a bit of analysis and familiarity with industry-specific metrics. However, with a little practice, anyone can get the hang of it. Equally important, using this checklist can help reveal some important risk factors that might not leap out at first glance. Getting to that point might require some additional upfront effort on your part, but the rewards will be worth it. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Son told reporters he planned to “invest into the new startup companies in the United States.” It would be difficult to create 50,000 jobs entirely by investing in startups, which generally employ few workers. Sprint employs about 30,000 people and has cut jobs to combat losses. In an interview, Son said the money will be coming from a $100 billion investment fund that he began setting up earlier this year with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners. Son’s plan to pour $50 billion is massive compared with the total amount of capital in venture circles.

816,,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","

818,,12152016,Reuters,12082016,"The end of negotiations was not a complete surprise. Les Moonves, the longtime chief executive of CBS, said last week talks were still stuck in the early stages, more than two months after the Redstones asked the boards of both companies to explore a tie-up. The two sides never entered talks on pricing and were far apart on Viacom’s value, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Shares of Viacom were down 7.9 percent at $39.10 in afternoon trading. In afternoon trading, CBS shares were down 0.4 percent at $62.12. National Amusements, the privately held movie company through which Shari Redstone and her 93-year-old father control 80 percent of the voting shares of CBS and Viacom, said in a letter they stopped pushing for a deal on the expectation of a turnaround at Viacom under new leadership. Viacom named Bob Bakish, head of its international business, acting chief executive officer at the end of October, and made that position permanent on Monday afternoon as it announced the end of merger explorations. Viacom, which owns Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV, has been struggling to turn around declining ad revenue and ratings while CBS is home to top-rated shows such “The Big Bang Theory” and “Thursday Night Football.” Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of Viacom and CBS, said he was not disappointed with the failure of merger plans and that he still believes that ultimately the two might merge. “Viacom needs to be fixed,” he said. One sticking point in negotiations was that CBS’s Moonves wanted autonomy over the merged company. National Amusements was willing to compromise on this issue, but in the end decided to let Bakish retain control of Viacom, according to the sources, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Bakish already has started taking action after just a few weeks as acting CEO. Last month,  the company announced it was buying Argentine broadcaster Television Federal SA from telecom carrier Telefonica SA for $345 million. He is also looking to improve relations with affiliates and is working on a plan to turn around MTV, a top priority for him, he told Reuters in November. Last week, he replaced Viacom’s head of distribution, Denise Denson, a longtime executive who worked closely with former CEO Philippe Dauman. In September, National Amusements called on Viacom and CBS to consider recombining, 10 years after Viacom was spun off from CBS. Shari Redstone had been in favor of recombining the two under Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. Industry speculation that the two might rejoin increased this year after the Redstones prevailed in a power struggle that resulted in Dauman’s departure. A Viacom spokesman confirmed it had received the letter from National Amusements, which was first reported by CNBC. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusement’s letter also said: “CBS continues to perform exceptionally well under Les Moonves.” Relations between Moonves and Shari Redstone continue to be good, the source said. This week, the two plan to go to Boston for the premiere of the film “Patriots Day,” produced by CBS Films. ","

The company stock was down 2.25% in pre-market trading. In a press release late Wednesday, Yahoo said it believes an “unauthorized third party” stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August of 2013. That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.) For Verizon the latest disclosure may be the nail in the coffin that ends its hope of acquiring Yahoo to add to its purchase of AOL, which it made last year. After all, this data breach is double the size of the other one which has delayed the closing of the deal. In a statement to the media, Verizon said, “As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

Equinix agreed to pay $3.6 billion in cash to acquire 24 data center sites and their operations. All told, the sites contain 29 buildings, located in 15 metropolitan areas. Most of these are in the U.S.; two are located in South America, specifically Bogota, Colombia, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Equinix will also obtain 900 customers that currently use the facilities. Equinix expects the transaction to close by the middle of next year. Adding the Verizon assets to the REIT's current portfolio gives it 175 data centers in 43 localities, utilizing around 17 million gross square feet of space. Equinix believes the Verizon assets will be ""immediately accretive"" to its results. Specifically, the company estimates that it will add $450 million in revenue and $270 million in EBITDA in the 12 months after the deal closes. Verizon doesn't particularly want to be in the data center business, while Equinix is eager to expand. So this is an appropriate and opportunistic transaction for both parties. In its press release, the REIT quoted CEO Steve Smith as saying -- accurately, in my view -- that ""the new assets will bring hundreds of new customers to Platform Equinix while establishing a presence in new markets and expanding our footprint in existing key metros."" It's a good time to be in the data center business, as enterprises rely more and more on the services such facilities provide.

Coverage map. Image source: Verizon Communications. There has been much hype this year about the next-generation 5G wireless network. However, investors looking to bet on the new network should forget about big wireless providers Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). For two main reasons, smaller, behind-the-scenes companies that are helping develop the new technology look like a more promising option. The country's two largest telecom businesses are working hard to bring the faster, more reliable network to market. Both have begun running technical trials and are planning real-world pilot programs beginning next year. A new wireless network will bring a flood of new sales of devices that are 5G-compatible. And a new round of fighting over wireless subscribers among the country's handful of carriers will no doubt ensue as well. But AT&T and Verizon aren't betting the farm on it, as made evident by each company's recent activity. For AT&T, it started with last year's DirecTV purchase, followed up by last month's proposed acquisition of Time Warner. Verizon has taken a slightly different path with its AOL and proposed Yahoo! acquisitions, as well as a slew of smaller tech and media company purchases. The goal in both instances are the same, though. The wireless carriers are transforming themselves into multimedia conglomerates rather than wireless network pure plays. A new 5G network will certainly play a part in both businesses, but it won't be leveraged in the same way as older networks were. Past wireless networks were all about increasing speed and reliability, and the next-gen network also won't disappoint. Initial testing is toting 5G as anywhere from 10 to 100 times faster than the current 4G network. But download speeds are only part of the discussion. The 5G network will move beyond the world of cellphones and will encompass the entire universe of technology, what has been dubbed the Internet of Things. The needs of the new network will include being able to support billions of connected devices, everything from wearable tech like smartwatches to autonomous cars to sensors on industrial equipment. Much more than just a newer and faster network for telecommunications, 5G is really a new medium of data transmission that paves the way for new technology that will shape our world in the decades ahead. With that in mind, let's take a look at two stocks that could be good ways to play the latest tech revolution. With 5G set to encompass much more than just your smartphone, the companies that are helping develop the network and devices that will use it are a more appealing investment than the telecoms. Here are two companies much smaller than Verizon and AT&T that are at the forefront of this research. Image source: InterDigital. InterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC), which helped develop past wireless network technology, is also involved with engineering the latest 5G network. The company makes its money by developing solutions and earning patent fees and royalties for their use. Currently, InterDigital revenue comes from a combination of past technology royalties and new technology solutions income. It has been a good year as the top line has expanded with a large royalty sale of a past patent during the last quarter. In tandem with increasing sales has been an increasing bottom line as well, as the company has been looking for ways to keep costs down. IDCC Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Much work remains for the development of the 5G network platform, and InterDigital's engineers have been tasked with solving some critical issues. On the work docket is developing ways to address the need for reliability of ultra-sensitive data transmission for autonomous driving and remote healthcare, and the need for traffic prioritization for billions of interconnected machine communications. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a designer and maker of wireless-connectivity-enabling semiconductors. The company's technology has been powering smartphones for some time, but as a new wave of devices come to market requiring connectivity, Skyworks has been there to answer the call as well. The company saw top-line sales slow dramatically this year, taking a breather after revenue more than doubled in the last five years. Profits also initially slid, but ended up finishing the fiscal year on a high note and notched a 26% year-over-year increase on decreasing expenses. SWKS Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Global smartphone growth has slowed since 2015, but the Internet of Things movement is just getting under way. When 5G begins to roll out in the next few years, new chips enabling connection to it will need to be developed and sold. Skyworks is in a good position to benefit when that happens. ","

Four huge companies that control 70% of the digital communications sector have been using their market power to overcharge the typical household about $45 a month ($540 per year), according to a new report (link opens in PDF) from the non-profit Consumer Federation of America (CFA). AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) form what the researchers call a ""tight oligopoly on steroids."" These four companies, according to the report, have protected their control over prices by not competing head-to-head to ""a remarkable extent,"" leading to more than $60 billion in annual overcharges. This is good for the companies and their shareholders. By not competing in three consumer-facing businesses -- wireless, broadband internet access, and multichannel video programming service (cable) as well as the behind-the-scenes data services -- these companies have been able to consistently keep prices moving up (while costs have fallen). ""Stockholders love the astronomical rate of return, but consumers hate it,"" said Dr. Mark Cooper, CFA's director of research and the author of the report, in a press release, ""which is reflected in the very low ratings that these products get in consumer satisfaction surveys."" The federation released its report while testifying against the AT&T/Time Warner merger. Comcast is one of the companies on the hot seat in this report. Image source: The Motley Fool. AT&T, Comcast, Charter, and Verizon have generally avoided competing with each other, keeping largely to territorial boundaries dating back to before the Telecommunications Act of 1996 when they enjoyed actual monopolies. The report noted that AT&T and Verizon were slow to go into the video business (though both are in it now) while the major cable companies still have chosen to not offer wireless services to compete directly with telecommunications companies. ""Instead of competing vigorously on a head-to-head basis, they preferred to buy each other out,"" the federation wrote. ""This not only eliminated the most likely potential competitors, but it also gave them huge fortress regions. Lax antitrust and regulatory policy for the first 15 years of the implementation of the 1996 Act allowed this to come about."" In the press release, Cooper was quoted as saying: ""All of the negative aspects of the tight oligopoly on steroids come into play in the ATT-TWX mergers.  In many respects ATT is the dominant player in the tight oligopoly, with a strong position in wireless, business data services, and video distribution. Allowing it to acquire a major content producer would give it much stronger incentives and an enhanced ability to leverage its market power to harm consumers and competition."" Competition lowers prices. In much of the country, when it comes to cable and internet service, AT&T (which owns DirecTV as well as the U-verse video service), Charter, and Comcast do not face comparable direct competition. Consumers might be able to opt for DISH Network to meet their television needs, but they still, in much of the country, would need AT&T, Charter, Comcast, or Verizon for broadband service. All four of these companies to different extents have pricing power based on many Americans simply not having any other realistic choice. The CFA did note that T-Mobile's ""aggressive competition strategy is definitely putting downward pressure on prices and excess profits, saving consumers $5-$10 per month."" Despite that, it found that the a typical household, which has two cellphones, one landline, and a video-internet bundle, that uses AT&T or Verizon still pays an extra $10 per line. ""To estimate the total overcharges, we applied the $10 [monthly] overcharge figure only to the subscribers of the dominant carriers [AT&T and Verizon],"" the federation wrote, working that out to total annual overcharges of more than $40 billion. ""This equals to just over a quarter of the revenues of the firms with overcharges,"" the federation said. The study found similar results in broadband and video bundles. It used an overcharge number of $25 per household per month, despite writing that ""there are reasons to believe that this estimate is low."" Since between 70 million and 90 million homes have bundled broadband and cable, Cooper used 80 million as the base to estimate aggregate overcharges. ""The total would be $24 billion,"" the report says, again about a quarter of the revenue in these segments for the firms with overcharges. The federation wrote that competition could ultimately force prices lower, stating that all four of these companies would be thriving even without the overcharges. ""We find that the companies have been throwing off cash at the rate of $80 billion per year for mergers and acquisitions, increased liquid assets (retained earnings and stock repurchases), excess dividends and high prices paid for auctioned spectrum to keep spectrum out of the hands of potential competitors,"" the report says. ""Thus, excess returns to shareholders easily account for the excess profits and cost-reducing competitive effects would add to total consumer savings."" Whether that competition comes depends on a number of things. Disruptive technology could, for example, offer more people a broadband alternative that could hurt these companies' ability to keep consumers in cable/internet bundles. That is already happening in the wireless space, but Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter have been very successful when it comes to keeping competition from gaining a toehold. It could happen, but deals like AT&T buying Time Warner make it even less likely. ","

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Image source: Getty Images. The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the growing network of connected sensors and devices, and the increasing connectivity is already having significant impacts at the consumer, enterprise, and public levels. Research firm Gartner expects the number of IoT devices to grow from 6.4 billion in 2016 to nearly 21 billion in 2020, and estimates that more than half of new business systems and processes will utilize the Internet of Things by the end of that period. Growth in device connectivity and machine-to-machine communication is creating an explosion of new data, and this information is being sorted and analyzed to produce insights that can improve efficiency and drive substantial economic value. Brian Feroldi (Verizon): There's no doubt that the Internet of Things trend offers tremendous growth opportunities for all kinds of tech companies. However, I personally do not think that buying an electronic hardware manufacturer is the right way to play the trend. The reason? Huge growth potential will attract a lot of competition. Over time, that competition will erode away profit margins, leaving investors with poor returns. For that reason, I think it is a far smarter idea to buy shares of a cellular network provider like Verizon Communications instead. After all, those billions of devices that are expected to come online will need access to a mobile network in order to work. That provides Verizon with a great new avenue for growth in the years ahead. You might not be aware of it, but Verizon is already benefiting from the IoT trend. Last quarter, Verizon's IoT revenue grew by 24% to $217 million, making it one of the company's fastest-growing divisions. Sure, that's still just a drop in the bucket when compared with the company's wireless and wireline revenue, but over time IoT revenue holds promise to grow like wildfire. That could help propel the company's long-term revenue and profit growth. Verizon certainly believes that the IoT represents a huge opportunity, which is why it is investing accordingly. Earlier this year, Verizon bought Telogis and Sensity Systems, both of which will add to the company's IoT product offering. Over time I think investors should expect even more bolt-on acquisitions to ensure that it maintains a strong foothold in this important and growing market. Throw in a dividend yield that tops 4.6% and I think Verizon is a great way for conservative investors to get their IoT exposure. Keith Noonan (Cisco): Overcoming security and standardization issues that arise from moving data between disparate devices and networks is one of the main obstacles to the evolution of connectivity, and no company is better suited to deal with it than Cisco. The company's Internet of Things and Applications Group vice president, Rowan Trollope, recently said that the company can deliver many of the connectivity and security needs brought on by IoT because ""it owns the network."" There's some simplification involved in that statement, but Cisco's leading position in networking means that the company is going to have a formative impact on the progression of IoT. The company is in the process of giving device makers tools and applications-programming interfaces to help with standardization and to cut down on security threats that could limit the progression of the tech. Cisco is taking these steps to get the big players on board with its network and certification process in order to facilitate its transition to a more subscription-based business model. This year, the company purchased Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion in order to bolster its service offerings and fast-track its position in IoT connectivity and analytics platforms. The big connectivity push also presents opportunities that could lift Cisco's hardware businesses. The networking giant has partnered with Ericsson, Intel, and Verizon for the development of a 5G mobile router, and could benefit from demand for routers and switches that are tailored for customers' IoT needs. Priced at just 12.5 times forward earnings estimates, with roughly $40 billion in cash and short-term investments on the books, and a 3.5% dividend yield, Cisco stock offers an inexpensive valuation, hefty returned income, and a forefront position in the Internet of Things.

Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

835,Stu Woo,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 10, 2016 2:01 p.m. ET By LONDON -- Telecommunications giant Vodafone Group PLC has a mantra: Be No. 1. Or No. 2. U.K.-based Vodafone, the world's second-biggest mobile carrier by subscribers, is trying to keep that position by having the most -- or second-most -- customers in each of its 26 countries. ""It's not really about being the leader,"" Chief Executive Vittorio Colao told analysts last month. Vodafone believes the top two players in telecom markets -- and it doesn't matter if they are first or second -- are able to differentiate themselves through superior networks and services. By focusing investments in these two areas, the leading operators can justify higher prices. ""The gap versus No. 3s is not only stable, but even increasing,"" Mr. Colao said, adding ""it's about really creating a two-tier market."" Even after a $130 billion windfall from the 2014 sale of its Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone has so far eschewed big, global expansion. Under Mr. Colao, a 55-year-old Italian reserve military officer who took over as CEO in 2008, the company left the consumer U.S. market and has plowed investment into Europe and the developing world instead. Vodafone's biggest competitors are typically formerly state-owned fixed-line giants still catching up in the mobile age. It earned GBP41 billion ($50 billion) in revenue for the last full fiscal year and ranks below only China Mobile Ltd. in terms of global subscribers. Over two years, Mr. Colao spent about $24 billion across his empire, which is concentrated in Europe, Africa and India, to expand high-speed mobile networks, the pillar of its marketing campaigns. Vodafone also spent about $20 billion in 2013 and 2014 to buy major cable operators in Germany and Spain, and it is expanding its wired cable and internet network so it can sell the telecom industry's Holy Grail: a ""quad-play"" package that offers mobile, landline telephone, cable and internet services on one bill. The results so far are mixed: Vodafone said last month that its plan was paying off in parts of Europe, but proving much more expensive than anticipated in India. Overall, Vodafone's organic revenue, which excludes foreign-exchange movement, grew 2.2% in the third quarter of 2016, outperforming the average 1.6% growth of major Europe-based telecom firms, according to Raymond James analyst Stephane Beyazian. Leading the way over the past six months was Germany, with 2.3% organic growth, and Italy, at 1.7%. But Vodafone's organic revenue declined 2.7% in its home market of the U.K. -- where it is the No. 3 mobile operator behind BT Group PLC, which operates the EE brand, and Telefónica SA's O2. Mr. Colao blames the shortfall partly on billing problems and customer-service complaints related to a new computer system. Even more costly has been defending its No. 2 status in India. New mobile carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., funded by India's richest man, has offered free service for at least a month to get new customers. Vodafone wrote down the value of its India business by EUR5 billion ($5.3 billion) earlier this month, citing the competition. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who gives stuff for free,"" Mr. Colao said. Vodafone was formed in Newbury, England, in 1984 and spun off from military and electronics conglomerate Racal Electronics Group in 1991. It was one of the world's first mobile-focused telecom companies, and obtained licenses in a hodgepodge of countries early in the cellphone era and via two big deals. It merged with AirTouch Communications, a San Francisco-based mobile carrier with world-wide holdings, in 1999. The next year, it acquired Mannesmann AG, a German telecommunications business with European operations. In 1999, Vodafone merged its U.S. mobile operations with those of Bell Atlantic Corp., with the latter renaming itself Verizon Communications Inc. They called their joint venture Verizon Wireless, with Verizon owning 55% and Vodafone the other 45%. Verizon Communications had long tried to buy out Vodafone's shares, but the two didn't reach an agreement until 2013. The sale closed in 2014. Vodafone gave back $84 billion from the sale to shareholders -- the largest single return in modern corporate history. A chunk of the remainder went to pay taxes and reduce debt. The rest of those funds helped bankroll Vodafone's two-year network-improvement program. The project, which mostly wrapped up this past spring, focused on expanding Vodafone's fourth-generation mobile network, or 4G, in Europe and both its fourth- and third-generation networks in emerging markets such as India. For years, Vodafone and John Malone's Liberty Global PLC have publicly flirted with the idea of a combination. The two companies expect to complete a merger of their operations in the Netherlands later this year, creating a 50-50 joint venture. Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference last month, Mr. Colao and Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said the Dutch tie-up wasn't necessarily indicative of future deals. But Mr. Colao kept the door open. ""We see the world the same way,"" Mr. Colao told investors, describing Mr. Fries. ""Is this the first trial of something bigger? Not necessarily....But of course it helps to know each other.""

                                    in jeopardy. To make security great again, we must augment the best preventive security with detection capabilities that can catch an attacker red-handed at an early stage, before damage can occur. This is a departure from the conventional “Cold War” security mindset that is concerned with keeping attackers out by building taller and thicker walls. It involves assuming that attackers will break into the network and become active — the most common breach scenario of 2016 — and shifting strategy, tools and staffing as a result. Today, the industry average time for finding an active attacker is about five months, reflecting the colossal failure of conventional security. The state of the union for federal security is that few if any non-defense agencies can find an active attacker on their network. Most cannot find a network intruder or a malicious insider, such as a rogue employee or contractor, working to steal or damage information or assets. Consider that the National Security Agency, the Office of Personnel Management and the FBI were breached along top security vendors and agencies. If government agencies with some of the top security talent were no match for cybercriminals, how can an enterprise stand up to the same threats? Since most organizations, public or private, lack the ability to find active network attackers, there is no telling if an intruder is lurking and what they have been able to accomplish. Only in the relatively straightforward “breaking and entering” cybercrimes of stolen personal information or financial details does it become clear at some point that a breach has transpired and damage has been done. With other forms of attack, you may never know. While defensive security is essential, it is no longer sufficient to protect networks. Security leaders in business and government need to admit to today’s reality and focus efforts on detecting active attackers. They need to shift from the traditional model of first encountering a threat and then developing a way to identify and block it. Instead, they need to find attackers by their operational activities that may blend in with normal network events. Such detection is difficult, but it can be done. It requires security based on behavioral profiling to find exceptional attack activities, rather than just trying to prevent the installation of malware. Preventive security is actually quite good and can deflect the vast majority of external threats. The trouble is that it can’t prevent every one. There are far too many ways for an attacker to get into a network, often just through compromising an employee’s or contractor’s computer or account through phishing or malicious software that loads on an unsuspecting user from a legitimate website. Now, in addition to a strong defense, companies need to expect that attackers will be able make their way on to the network. They need to spot them by their operational activities—the step-by-step processes that attackers must perform to gain control of valuable network assets. Instead of trying to find aspects of “known bad,” security professionals need a model of “known good” so that attacker activities can stand out from normal network events. That, for example, would understand that no one in the marketing department has ever used a tool like PowerShell, which is for network administrators, and to flag it as an anomaly when one does. One of the most important questions Donald Trump should be asking after he takes office in January is: “Do we have the ability to know if there is an active attacker on our networks?” That should be followed up with: “If so, how?” or “What is our level of confidence?” C-suite executives should be asking the same questions. What’s needed in both the public and private sectors is a new impetus for protecting vital assets and entrusted information based on admitting that an attacker will get in. Continuing with today’s approach will only yield more devastating loss and damage and becomes an illustration of insanity. Security must be modernized to meet the modern challenges and make it great again. Kasey Cross is director of product management at LightCyber, a leading provider of behavioral attack detection.

837,,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed. The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday. Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement. Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41. Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record. It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers. The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement. Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email. A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.” ","

838,,12222016,Reuters,12152016,"SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the summer of 2013, Yahoo Inc launched a project to better secure the passwords of its customers, abandoning the use of a discredited technology for encrypting data known as MD5. It was too late. In August of that year, hackers got hold of more than a billion Yahoo accounts, stealing the poorly encrypted passwords and other information in the biggest data breach on record. Yahoo only recently uncovered the hack and disclosed it last week. The timing of the attack might seem like bad luck, but the weakness of MD5 had been known by hackers and security experts for more than a decade. MD5 can be cracked more easily than other so-called “hashing” algorithms, which are mathematical functions that convert data into seemingly random character strings. In 2008, five years before Yahoo took action, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute issued a public warning to security professionals through a U.S. government-funded vulnerability alert system: MD5 “should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use.” Yahoo’s failure to move away from MD5 in a timely fashion was an example of problems in Yahoo’s security operations as it grappled with business challenges, according to five former employees and some outside security experts. Stronger hashing technology would have made it more difficult for the hackers to get into customer accounts after breaching Yahoo’s network, making the attack far less damaging, they said. “MD5 was considered dead long before 2013,” said David Kennedy, chief executive of cyber firm TrustedSec LLC. “Most companies were using more secure hashing algorithms by then.” He did not name specific firms. Yahoo, which has confirmed it was still using MD5 at the time of the attack, disputed the notion that the company had skimped on security. “Over the course of our more than 20-year history, Yahoo has focused on and invested in security programs and talent to protect our users,” Yahoo said in a statement to Reuters. “We have invested more than $250 million in security initiatives across the company since 2012.” The former Yahoo security staffers, however, told Reuters the security team was at times turned down when it requested new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections, on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority. Partly, that reflected the internet pioneer’s long-running financial struggles: Yahoo’s revenues and profits have fallen steadily since their 2008 peak while Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and others have come to dominate the consumer internet business. “When business is good, it’s easy to do things like security,” said Jeremiah Grossman, who worked on Yahoo’s security team from 1999 to 2001. “When business is bad, you expect to see security get cut.” To be sure, no system is completely hack-proof. Hackers have managed to break into passwords that were encrypted using more advanced technologies than MD5. Other Internet companies, such as LinkedIn and AOL, have also suffered security breaches, though none nearly as large as Yahoo’s. “This could happen to any large corporation,” said Tom Kellermann, a former World Bank security manager and security industry executive. Kellermann, now CEO of investment firm Strategic Cyber Ventures, said he was not surprised that it had taken Yahoo several years to identify the massive attacks. “Hackers often have a capacity to burrow deeper than we thought into a system and remain for years,” he said. Reuters could not determine how many companies besides Yahoo were using MD5 in 2013. Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp did not immediately respond to requests for comment. According to another former security veteran at Yahoo, even when the company was growing quickly, security sometimes took a back seat as the company focused on system performance to keep up with the growth. Then, when growth stalled, senior security staff left for other companies and the chances of getting approval for expensive upgrades dropped further, the person said. “Any changes to the user database took forever because they were understaffed, and it’s an ultra-critical system - everything depends on it,” said the former Yahoo employee. Yahoo declined to comment on details of its security practices, but said it routinely conducted drills to test and improve its cyber defenses and highlighted campaigns such as a “bug bounty” program in which it pays hackers to find security flaws and report them to the company. Last September, Yahoo disclosed a 2014 cyber attack that affected at least 500 million customer accounts, the biggest known data breach at the time. Following last week’s news of the even bigger 2013 breach, U.S. federal investigators and lawmakers said they are scrutinizing Yahoo’s security practices, and Verizon Communications Inc is seeking to renegotiate a July deal to buy Yahoo’s internet business for $4.8 billion. The former Yahoo employees said the company’s security problems began before the arrival of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer in 2012 and continued under her tenure. Yahoo had suffered attacks by Russian hackers for years, two of the former staffers said. In 2014, Yahoo hired a new security chief, Alex Stamos, and one of the security crews he led - known internally as ‘The Paranoids’ - thought they were making headway against the hackers, former employees said. In 2015, when the security crew discovered a hidden program attached to Yahoo’s email servers that was monitoring all incoming messages, their first thought was that the Russian hackers had come back. It turned out that the program had been installed by Yahoo’s email engineers to comply with a secret surveillance order requested by a U.S. intelligence agency, as Reuters previously reported. Stamos and some of his staff left Yahoo soon after that, creating further disruptions to security operations. This week, in addition to disclosing the 2013 hack, Yahoo said someone had accessed its proprietary computer code to learn how to forge “cookies,” which would allow hackers to access an account without passwords. Yahoo said it connected some cookie-forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor it believed was responsible for the 2014 data theft. “They burrowed in and got access to everything,” said Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits. On Thursday, Germany’s cyber security authority criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt adequate encryption techniques and advised German consumers to switch to other email providers. Yahoo told Reuters it was committed to keeping users secure by staying ahead of new threats. “Today’s security landscape is complex and ever-evolving, but, at Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure.” ","

That’s in addition to the half a million customers whose data was hacked in another incident which Yahoo disclosed in September. The company believes the August 2013 hack is “likely distinct” from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company’s data. (Read more: Yahoo Discloses New Potential Breach.) For Verizon the latest disclosure may be the nail in the coffin that ends its hope of acquiring Yahoo to add to its purchase of AOL, which it made last year. After all, this data breach is double the size of the other one which has delayed the closing of the deal. In a statement to the media, Verizon said, “As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."" Ever since Yahoo’s first disclosure in September that it had been hacked, the deal between the Internet giant and one of the leading wireless telecom players has been up in the air. Yahoo has repeatedly said the deal was going to go through, while Verizon said it was conducting due diligence to see if the initial breach was material. In recent weeks, Verizon executives said it's likely material but didn’t shy away from the acquisition. Earlier this month, AOL Chief Tim Armstrong said at Business Insider’s IGNITION conference in New York he is “cautiously optimistic—or optimistic” the deal will go ahead. Armstrong said Verizon and Yahoo will start planning what a combined company will look like. By the first quarter of 2017, Armstrong said there will be more clarity for the organization.  (Read more: AOL CEO Optimistic on Verizon-Yahoo Deal.)

(CHTR) shares have been gaining in recent days, up more than 4.5% so far this week on continued speculation Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) could buy the cable operator. According to media reports, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts at a meeting earlier this week that buying Charter would make “industrial sense.” McAdam didn’t say Verizon was readying a move or considering a deal, nor was Charter Communications expressing interest. The New York Post, citing sources that were present at the meeting, said Verizon would have to raise its level of debt to acquire Charter Communications, which could make a deal a non-starter. What’s more, the same people told the paper it’s not clear if the Trump Administration would support a deal between the two. Charter, which in May purchased Time Warner Cable for $71 billion, has a market capitalization of $78.8 billion. Ever since AT&T Inc.’s move to acquire Time Warner Inc. and launch its own streaming video content service, DirecTV Now, speculation has been swirling about other M&A in the telecom industry. While some industry watchers said Charter could go after a content company, CEO Tom Rutledge poured cold water on that at a recent investor conference. The executive said Charter is happy where it’s at and doesn’t need to buy a content company. But he didn’t rule out making cable acquisitions, pointing out that the incoming Trump Administration appears more open to consolidation. (See also: Comcast Is Launching Netflix on Set-Top Boxes.) While Charter may be shrugging off any deals outside its realm, one investor, TCI, the hedge fund founded by Chris Hohn, is preparing for it to buy more shares and eventually get a buyout offer from Verizon. Speaking during the Sohn Conference in London last week, Hohn, who owns shares of Charter, said he thinks the company will be a takeover target given the consolidation going on in the U.S. market, naming Verizon as a bidder. Hohn’s comments echo a similar assessment by RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who recently initiated coverage of Charter with an outperform rating and $325 price target. In a research note, Atkin said Charter would either engage in a large acquisition or launch a big stock buyback program. (See also: Charter Shares Up After RBC Starts Coverage.)

Although the media has focused on Dodd-Frank and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare) as the biggest regulatory rules enacted under President Barack Obama's administration, perhaps the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has been the most aggressive agency in terms of its regulatory relationship with the industry it oversees. Before Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC was known as a textbook case of regulatory capture with a virtual revolving door of lobbyists and industry titans filling its ranks. Wheeler was considered no different: As the former head of both the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NTCA) and Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, it was widely expected that Wheeler would continue to represent industry interests and apply light-touch regulation. Image source: Getty Images. Instead, Wheeler's FCC has been extremely pro-consumer, to the consternation of the industry. The news that Wheeler is now departing his position could mean a reversal of his pro-consumer legacy and, most notably, his signature net neutrality ruling. In 2015, Wheeler's FCC cemented its pro-consumer legacy. By classifying Internet-service providers (ISPs) as ""common carriers,"" the legislative rule-making body essentially guaranteed net neutrality by ensuring ISPs act as a neutral gateway to the Internet and banning ISPs from speeding up or slowing down legal content passing through their networks. While consumer advocates, digital publishers, and streaming video providers like Netflix were elated with the decision, network providers like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Comcast were enraged with the FCC's Title II designation. Quickly after the ruling, the NTCA (yes, the same organization once led by Chairman Wheeler) and the American Cable Association quickly moved to sue the FCC. AT&T filed a separate lawsuit quickly thereafter. In June, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the FCC and upheld their common carrier status. However, as is customary when a new party wins an election, Wheeler has agreed to step down as FCC chairman on Jan. 20, when Donald Trump is inaugurated. The newly appointed FCC head will most likely be a net-neutrality foe and, along with the new republican FCC majority, will quickly chip away at earlier pro-net neutrality rulings. Net neutrality has become a partisan lawmaker issue, with Democrats in near-unanimous support with Republicans referring to the ruling as ""Obamacare of the Internet."" Recode succinctly described Wheeler's departure as the ""death knell"" for net neutrality. The obvious winners of a repeal of net neutrality would be the ISPs themselves. The ability to charge sites more for using their network is another monetization method to boost top-line results. However, ISPs could still benefit from net neutrality's demise without charging websites for faster delivery. For example, Verizon could be well positioned since it has doubled down on a digital-strategy by purchasing AOL (and its host of digital properties like Engadget, The Huffington Post, and TechCrunch ) and is in the process of buying Yahoo!. Delivering these websites faster while slowing down others should boost the company's bottom line by making these sites more attractive to users...and by extension, marketers. To be fair, some consumers could be beneficiaries of net neutrality laws as well. As wireless service has become a quite-competitive space, carriers have resorted to creative ways to differentiate themselves and to promote higher-margin products. For example, AT&T has announced that streaming on its DirecTV Now products does not count against wireless data cap limits. Verizon offers the same deal for its NFL Mobile and Go90 streaming-video app. The FCC had argued these data-free cutouts, also known as zero-metering, were violations of net neutrality since they amounted to unfair treatment of competing services. Consumers may ultimately receive cheaper internet, but at the expense of a more-limited user experience dictated by consumer interest. One thing is for sure: ISPs are elated about Wheeler's pending departure -- whether consumers should be is decidedly less clear. ","

Kline,12222016,Fool,12152016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) both operate subscription-driven businesses facing pressure from changing technologies, increased competition, and somewhat uncertain consumer behavior. The main differences between the two companies are scale -- AT&T had revenues of $40.9 billion in Q3, while Frontier had $2.52 billion -- and diversity. AT&T sells internet, cable, satellite, landline, and wireless service, while Frontier offers only cable, landlines, and internet. AT&T, of course, also has a deal to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL), which would heavily diversify it outside its core businesses. AT&T is what Frontier hopes to be someday. It's a giant that has the most pay-television customers (when you add DIRECTV and its U-verse brand), the second-most wireless subscribers behind Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and the third most internet customers. Frontier has bought its way to a position of minor relevance with about 5.5 million customers, and about 4.4 million of those get broadband from the company and 1.5 million paying for cable. Still, while AT&T dwarfs Frontier, giants have a longer way to fall than those a little closer to the ground. Both companies face similar challenges, but each one is set up to handle them differently. AT&T has built a revenue machine where it can leverage its various products to attain customers, keep them, and get them to spend more. For example, it no longer offers new wireless subscribers unlimited data, but it made an exception to that policy for anyone who bundled wireless with DIRECTV. That's an attractive deal that's likely to win customers from rivals. It's also an offer that makes it that much harder for people to leave. AT&T, however, does face risks in a few areas. In wireless, the company faces pricing pressure from T-Mobile and Sprint, both of which are spending a lot of money on ads pointing out that AT&T and Verizon no longer have commanding leads when it comes to network quality. The company also faces cord-cutting issues on a grand scale. Broadly, its U-verse service has been losing customers (325,000 in Q3), while its cheaper DIRECTV has been gaining about the same amount (323,000 in Q3). That's an intentional move, as the company wants to move people to its satellite service, but ultimately it gives the company nearly 21 million eggs in the same DIRECTV basket. That's a risk that has so far paid off, but satellite is less reliable than wired service in many cases, and customers losing service during bad a snow or rain storm could tip them over the edge when it comes to cord-cutting. AT&T also has the very uncertain prospects of its purchase of Time Warner. Should the deal be approved, there's no guarantee that the company will be able to use the content company to increase loyalty to its other products. It's also worth noting that cord-cutting and skinny bundles are negative headwinds for Time Warner's cable channels as well. As the preceding chart showed, AT&T stock has been trending up while Frontier's has been inching down. Frontier opened the year at $4.60 and closed on December 14 at $3.44, a 25% drop. AT&T opened 2016 at $34.08 before closing on Dec. 14 at $41.11, a 20% gain. Those numbers tell you everything you need to know about how investors see the two companies against each other. But there is one case where in 2017 Frontier shareholders could see a better than 20% return. That's not likely to happen because of continuing operations, as the company has had a hard time holding onto or adding customers. That could, maybe even should, improve as the company further integrates the California, Texas, and Florida properties it bought from Verizon, but it's hard to see Frontier making any big leaps forward. Where Frontier could outpace AT&T in shareholder return next year is if it were to be acquired. There are very few smaller cable and internet players left to be acquired, and Frontier might fetch more than the 22% premium Altice paid for Cablevision  in September 2015. Cable and internet make up a space where size matters, and Frontier doesn't have it. AT&T faces some negative headwinds, and the Time Warner deal could be a short-term drag, but ultimately it simply has too many entrenched ways to make money. It faces the same challenges Frontier does, but it has more tools to combat the problem. An acquisition might bring Frontier shareholders a better return than AT&T delivers next year, but for the long term, despite the challenges it faces, AT&T has a more diverse company setup to win customers, keep them, and wrangle more money out of them. Frontier simply can't offer that. ","

Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. ""Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,"" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. ""The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over."" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. ","

Most financial advisors will tell retirees to put most of their savings in bonds, which offer fixed income without the volatility -- so long as they aren't sold before maturity. That might seem wise as interest rates climb, but retirees can still consider buying a few high-yielding ETFs (exchange-traded funds) for better price appreciation or higher yields. Image source: Getty Images. Within this category, I prefer well-diversified ETFs that have a good track record of beating the S&P 500, or covered call ETFs that might lag the market but offer much higher yields. Let's take a look at three ETFs that fit those criteria: the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:HDV), and the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY). The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is a passively managed basket of the 419 highest-yielding stocks in the U.S. (excluding REITs and master limited partnerships), and it weights them according to their market caps. Its top 10 holdings -- which account for 31% of its portfolio -- include Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and JPMorgan Chase. The ETF currently pays a 2.9% dividend, which is 38% higher than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.1%, and over the past decade it has roughly matched the performance of the S&P 500 (though it has lagged slightly over the past five years). Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns, but this well-diversified ETF represents a simple way to remain invested in the top dividend stocks at all times. Its low expense ratio of 0.09% also makes it much cheaper than actively managed ETFs. However, the ETF is currently trading above its NAV (net asset value) at the time of this writing, which means a slight correction could be coming. Investors looking for a higher-than-average yield should check out the iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which pays a 3.4% yield. The ETF consists of a smaller basket of 75 high-yielding U.S. dividend stocks (which also excludes REITs and MLPs), and its top holdings include ExxonMobil, AT&T, Chevron, Verizon, and Johnson & Johnson. Its exposure to oil, which accounts for 20% of its holdings, is slightly worrisome due to volatile oil prices and ExxonMobil and Chevron's current payout ratios of over 100%. However, oil prices could stabilize next year on production cuts and rising demand. This passively managed ETF has a low expense ratio of 0.08%, making it a lower-cost and higher-yielding play than Vanguard's High Dividend Yield ETF. However, the iShares ETF has slightly underperformed Vanguard's over the past five-year and 10-year periods, and currently trades slightly above its NAV. Investors looking for long-term dividend growth might favor the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF, which owns a basket of 108 Dividend Aristocrats (including REITs) -- that is, companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 straight years. The fund's top holdings include AT&T, People's United Financial, HCP, Chevron, and Nucor. Its portfolio is heavily weighted toward the industrial and financial sectors, which each account for about 16% of its holdings. Dividend-generating ETFs can help retirees quickly diversify their portfolios across various sectors and generate a steady stream of income. However, some dividend ETFs that chase yield neglect crucial factors like free cash flows, payout ratios, and dividend hike histories. Therefore retirees might find that dividend stalwarts like AT&T or Johnson & Johnson can generate comparable income without the complexities of expense ratios and net asset values.

851,Michael Brush,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:46 a.m. ET Those with high deferred tax liabilities will be the real winners By Many investors are now hunting for companies that pay high U.S. taxes because they stand to benefit the most if Donald Trump cuts corporate taxes, as he said he would. But the real accounting sleuths are looking elsewhere for the hidden gems that may get the biggest boost. They’re digging up the companies that have the largest “deferred tax liabilities” on the books. If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

From current levels, the 2,263 area remains an inflection point, and is followed by the S&P’s all-time high of 2,277.5. (The S&P’s record closing high rests at 2,271.72, and has been challenged early Tuesday.)

                                   is holding the range top. Consider that before Tuesday, the Dow’s all-time closing, and absolute peaks held at 19,911.21, and 19,966.43, respectively. Both areas remain under siege. Conversely, the range bottom matches last week’s low of 19,748. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains technical. As illustrated, the index bottomed twice last week at 5,426, precisely matching first support. Conversely, the Nasdaq’s all-time closing, and intraday peaks, rest at 5,463.83, and 5,486.75 respectively. Separately, the index has staged alternating tests of the range across five straight sessions. Technical price action within an uptrend is bullish. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has sustained the December breakout. First support closely matches the 5,400 mark, and is followed by the 5,340 breakout point. More broadly, the prevailing upturn builds on the steep July rally. An intermediate-term target projects to the 5,570 area. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has taken flight, thus far topping 34 points under the 20,000 mark. Though still near-term extended — and due to consolidate at some point — the prevailing bull flag is a continuation pattern, technically positioning the index for incremental gains. Near-term support matches last week’s close of 19,843, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a deeper floor around 19,750. Similarly, the S&P 500 has established a flag pattern, digesting the December spike. Recall that S&P 2,252 marks near-term support, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by a more significant floor at 2,214. Broadly speaking, each major U.S. benchmark has established an orderly five-session range, consolidating slightly under record territory. The muted selling pressure, even after the Federal Reserve’s rate hike last week (and hawkishly revised outlook), is technically constructive. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. Recall that the IWM bottomed last week at 134.81 — slightly above the November peak — an area that pivots to support. Conversely, the all-time closing, and absolute peaks — 138.31, and 138.82, respectively — remain within striking distance. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has staged a flattish pullback from record territory. First support matches last week’s low, fractionally under 303, and is followed by the November peak of 298.77. Conversely, resistance matches the MDY’s all-time highs, technically spanning from 309.09 to 309.59. Widening considerably, to the S&P 500’s three-year view, adds perspective. Each bar on the chart above represents one week. As illustrated, the index has staged two directionally sharp 2016 spikes to uncharted territory. The prevailing late-year rally builds on the initial July Brexit-fueled breakout. The intervening downturn was comparably flat, punctuated by a brief pre-election violation of the 2,131 floor, and the more important 2,117 support. Fast forward to the present, and first support rests at S&P 2,252, an area pinned to price action, and a percentage downturn, detailed last week. This is followed by more significant support at the 2,214 breakout point, and the 2,190 mark, closely matching the December closing low. (Recall that the current leg higher originates from the Dec. 1 close of 2,191, effectively matching major support.) The S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term technical bias points higher barring a violation. Also see: Bull trend confirmed: Charting the approach of Dow 20,000 ahead of the Fed.

The shares subsequently followed through, plunging to record lows after the Federal Reserve’s policy statement. (Very generally, rising U.S. interest rates make the dollar more attractive versus the euro, a backdrop contributing to prevailing trends.) Fast forward to the present, and the euro has ventured closer to parity with the U.S. dollar, pressured amid rising geopolitical tensions, and following the Bank of Japan’s “status quo” policy statement, issued last night.

Image source: Getty Images. At first glance, Sprint (NYSE:S) vs. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) looks like a very simple, natural rivalry. Two of the four nationwide wireless networks, set up in a steel cage, do battle over traditional telecom metrics and issues, and a single survivor leaves the ring victorious. That's actually not how this rivalry works at all. Let's get complicated. First, let me give you a sense of the two companies' relative scale: Metric Verizon Sprint How Much Bigger Is Verizon's Number? Trailing revenue $128 billion $32.4 billion 4 times Net income $14 billion ($1.8 billion) N/A Trailing free cash flow $11.7 billion $2.4 billion 5 times Enterprise value $319 billion $65 billion 5 times Data source: Yahoo! Finance. In short, Sprint can't hold a candle to Verizon's hugeness. In an industry where economies of scale play a deciding role, this is a massive business advantage for Big Red. The company can strike billion-dollar deals without breaking a sweat, take large business risks without betting the farm, and negotiate from a position of cash-backed strength. Meanwhile, Sprint nurses negative earnings and returns on equity under a crushing debt load. The company depends on capital injections from majority owner SoftBank just to keep its network upgrades and other business plans alive. And for the income investors out there, Verizon sports a generous 4.3% dividend yield while Sprint can't afford to spend any cash at all on dividend checks. Knockout in round one, right? Verizon must be the only reasonable choice, thanks to a dominant financial performance. Well, not quite. Sprint investors have enjoyed a thrilling 138% return in 2016. Verizon shareholders had to settle for 16%, or 21% if you include reinvested dividend payments along the way. Market momentum is clearly on Sprint's side, and there are certainly plenty of buyers out there who see value in Sprint shares. Yes, more value than they see in Verizon's stock. In many ways, Sprint is a turnaround gamble. From the end of 2013 to the start of 2016, share prices had fallen a bloodcurdling 66%. The company is in the habit of reporting weak subscriber counts and even weaker bottom-line profits, and that hurts in the long run. This year's bounce rests on a firmer top line and smaller cash losses -- plus the tantalizing possibility of Sprint joining forces with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) to create a third megatelecom. Reports would have it that Sprint wants to buy T-Mobile in a deal financed by SoftBank cash. The Japanese company keeps inviting these rumors only to swat them away once the wild and woolly tales get going. In the latest round of this action, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son promised President-elect Donald Trump to invest $50 billion in the American market, raising the ghost of T-Mobile combination plans again. But the cash is reportedly meant for investment in smaller start-up businesses, not big-ticket buyouts. But that report's boost never faded from Sprint's stock chart, even after dismissing the direct buyout conclusion. VZ Total Return Price data by YCharts.

Image source: Getty Images. Though it might seem simple and straightforward, investing in top telecom stocks is far more complex than it initially seems. As we learned in an earlier two-part blueprint for investing in telecom companies, providers of wireless and landline services operate in a multifaceted, highly regulated industry. If you really want to gain an in-depth sense of the industry, I suggest the above two articles as a great starting place. However, as a quick primer, we'll review three of the most important high-level takeaways that anyone considering buying telecom stocks absolutely must consider. When it comes to winning in the telecom space, history shows time and again that size matters. The telecom industry's massive fixed costs -- and the voluminous cash flows they can eventually produce -- allow the companies with the financial resources to invest in their wireless or wireline infrastructure to maintain their competitive positions. Moreover, closing the gap between market leaders and potential challengers requires massive capital expenditures on the insurgents' parts, which can strain companies' balance sheets along the way. Here's a quick example of how this dynamic plays out among U.S. wireless providers, where AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the entrenched incumbents, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) desperately want to steal market share from the former. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash Flow from Operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital Expenditures -$19.2 billion -$17.7 billion -$7.0 billion -$4.7 billion) Free Cash Flow $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending 3/31/16. To me, this is one of the most important charts in explaining the current competitive stance of the U.S. wireless market. Verizon (143 million) and AT&T (133 million) enjoy a roughly 2-to-1 wireless subscriber advantage over T-Mobile (69 million) and Sprint (59 million). As you can see, this larger scale translates into AT&T and Verizon needing to invest a far smaller percentage of their cash from operations into their networks than Sprint or T-Mobile. All of that extra free cash flow gives Verizon and AT&T the ability to invest in opportunities like Verizon's acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!, or AT&T's DIRECTV and Time Warner buyouts. When it comes to the telecom business, it pays to be one of the top dogs over the long term. With well-known names like AT&T and Verizon sporting dividend yields more than double the market average, the telecom industry can be a paradise for income investors. However, chasing yield in this sector can be the siren song of a money-losing investment. Here, a company like rural wireline provider Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) serves as a useful cautionary tale. WIN data by YCharts. In case you've never heard of it, Windstream provides landline telephone, broadband, digital TV, and security services to 1.4 million subscribers across the rural areas of 18 states. Spun out from the now-defunct Alltel in 2006, Windstream's strategy has been to roll up as many rural fiber assets and subscribers as possible to essentially become the biggest fish in an area of the telecom industry that's in structural decline. This ""growth via merger"" model works well on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but it ultimately lies on the losing side of history. The company continues to push forward, recently announcing an all-stock merger with the similar EarthLink. However, with demand for its services declining as our digital world evolves, Windstream's core business strategy appears unsustainable over the long term. What likely first pops out when looking at Windstream is its 8% dividend yield. However, as you saw in the above chart, Windstream's temptingly high dividend yield should more appropriately be viewed as a proxy for its risk. There's a long list to support this truism -- see Alaska Communications Systems or Frontier Communications -- but chasing yield in the telecom space is a quick way for investors to lose their shirts, which segues nicely into the final point on telecom investing. The final telecom investing tip might seem obvious, but given the industry's sneakily diverse mix of companies, investors must understand in detail the business model and strategy of a given company prior to buying. Are they in a growing segment of the industry? Wireless providers and the companies that supply their infrastructure are growing, while older technologies are fading. What does their competitive positioning in that market look like? As we saw with wireless providers, AT&T and Verizon remain far stronger than T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite the wireless space's overall favorable growth characteristics, the benefits of that growth are rarely distributed evenly. At the end of the day, this harkens back to Warren Buffett's concept of a circle of competence. Investors make unintended mistakes when they don't take the time to fully understand any potential investment. The seeming simplicity and sleepiness of the telecom industry can mask the underlying complexity of the sector, much to an investors' detriment. Taking the time to dig into a company's competitive position, its dividend details (if applicable), and its business model and outlook are critical steps that can save investors from making costly missteps or, better still, help identify stocks that can earn investors thousands.

    3 Telecom Investing Tips That Could Earn You Thousands -- The Motley Fool

Image Source: Sprint. About two years ago, Sprint's (NYSE:S) marketing team started breaking out chainsaws and other power tools to promote the wireless carrier's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" offer. AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) customers could bring their wireless bills to Sprint, and it would give them a service plan with nearly identical data allotments for half the price they paid at the two larger carriers. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) customers didn't get to join in on the overzealous chainsaw-bill-demolishing fun until last year. But those earliest takers of Sprint's bill-shredding offer are now facing the fact that the promotional pricing is limited to two years. Sprint faces the challenge of moving those customers to its regular pricing without losing them to competitors. Even Sprint knows that pricing is its only differentiating factor. Its newest advertising campaign featuring ""Paul from Verizon"" touts how its network is almost as good as Verizon's and its service costs half the price. When the thousands of Sprint customers who switched over for the Cut Your Bill in Half promotion see their bills increase, they're going to have a hard time rationalizing sticking with Sprint. It will also mark the end of any two-year installment or leasing plans they signed when joining Sprint, providing an optimal time to switch carriers. T-Mobile is trying to move away from being viewed as a low-cost service provider like Sprint to a best-value service provider. It's made a few significant price increases over the last few years with the shift to T-Mobile One -- its unlimited data plan -- being the most noticeable. Still, it's hard to argue that T-Mobile doesn't provide one of the best values in wireless service if it has good coverage in your market. And its coverage is improving significantly with the deployment of its recently acquired 700 MHz spectrum -- which provides better signal strength inside buildings. During T-Mobile's third-quarter earnings call, CEO John Legere noted that it's seeing improved porting ratios with Sprint in the early fourth quarter -- i.e., more Sprint customers are coming to T-Mobile for every customer that's leaving it for Sprint. The other carriers' porting ratios remain stable, indicating the results are largely due to customers leaving Sprint specifically, not anything T-Mobile is doing differently. During the first quarter that Sprint ran its Cut Your Bill in Half promotion, it saw a 20% increase in gross postpaid phone additions year over year. It saw strong double-digit percentage growth in postpaid phone gross additions for the next few quarters, although management would often obscure exact details in their earnings releases. The point is, the promotion worked in that it attracted a lot of new customers to Sprint. The problem currently is that those customers are now about to experience a rate hike -- if they haven't already. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk expects Sprint's postpaid phone gross additions growth will decline to just 1.7% in the fourth quarter from 18.7% last year. He also sees subscriber churn increasing to 1.53% from 1.37% last quarter. As such, Sprint can expect to see continued declines in average revenue per user and slowing postpaid subscriber growth. The result is a likely return to net revenue declines after just breaking out of a two-year slide last quarter. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Investors have likely heard a lot about the Internet of Things (IoT). The term refers to the connection of formerly unconnected things to the Internet, so that they can collect data or automate processes. A smartwatch is an IoT device, and so is an Internet-connected tractor that knows how many seeds have been planted, and where. The IoT's broad applications have made it a favorite among some investors, and there are plenty of companies to choose from in the space. But is now a good time to invest? To help answer that question, let's take a look at a few key developments happening in the IoT space right now. Japanese telecom giant SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF) recently purchased the British chipmaker ARM Holdings for nearly $32 billion, mostly based on ARM's position in the IoT. SoftBank's billionaire CEO, Masayoshi Son, had this to say about the importance of IoT in the acquisition: ""First there was the internet, then the mobile internet and next there will be the internet of things, which is going to be the biggest paradigm shift in human history. I'm making this investment at the very beginning of this shift."" SoftBank's purchase of ARM was the company's largest acquisition, the biggest Japanese acquisition in Europe, and one of the largest acquisitions of 2016. The company is betting that ARM's IoT chip designs will be just as popular as ARM's tech has been in smartphones. But SoftBank isn't the only telecom betting on the IoT. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is already making inroads in the IoT space in the U.S. with its Hum automotive telematics service and its upcoming 5G network. The former allows drivers to add an internet-enabled device to their car's onboard diagnostics connection and pair it with an app that tracks how fast the car is going, monitors if it leaves a specified boundary, and provides maintenance reminders. But the real opportunity is in Verizon bringing an IoT-specific network online, to allow the billions future IoT devices to come online. Verizon's vice president of technology planning, Adam Koeppe, said in an interview earlier in 2016 that the ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies -- traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself -- that's where 5G comes into play."" The company says that 5G will be the ""foundation for creating more internet-connected devices"" and will bring part of the 5G network online sometime in 2017, with more expansion after that. Companies have been building out IoT platforms for developers for a few years now, but the number of platforms is increasing and their capabilities are expanding. Take Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for example. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been around for a while now, but the company is continually releasing new IoT platforms that help developers connect to it. Amazon's latest IoT platform, called Greengrass, debuted earlier this month and allows developers to set a single hub device to receive data from multiple low-energy devices and transmit the data to the cloud for those devices. All of this allows small IoT devices to conserve energy yet still collect data to be analyzed. That's just one small part of Amazon's broad-based IoT focus, but it's another example of the company building IoT platforms that tie directly into its AWS. That's good news for the company as it expands its AWS revenue, which was $3.2 billion in the third quarter. Amazon isn't the only one going down this path, of course. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has built out several iterations of IoT platforms, and just released its newest one, called Android Things. This version allows developers to build on Android APIs and connect with the company's new Google Assistant. Google has already released several different IoT plaforms (Android@Home and Brillo), but Android Things is already starting to gain traction, with Belkin, WeMo, and Honeywell already signing up. The benefit for Google is the same as with Amazon's IoT platform: If Google can get more developers to use its protocol when building IoT applications, then it might be able to host those devices on its cloud services as well. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) strong position in the mobile space is undeniable, but as sales of smartphones slow down, even this mobile juggernaut is looking to the IoT for new opportunities. The company made a $37 billion bid for chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) in October and expects the purchase to boost its IoT prospects. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf commented on the acquisition's potential during a conference call: ""Our priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being transformed by mobile technologies. Our proposed acquisition of NXP and our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in these segments."" Qualcomm will use the NXP purchase to enter the growing semi-autonomous car market, while benefiting from NXP's IoT position in the near-field communication and radio-frequency identification spaces as well. Qualcomm says that after the deal closes on NXP, the company will earn about 30% of its total revenue from the Internet of Things and automotive segments, up from about 8% right now. ","

858,Selena Maranjian,12292016,Fool,12222016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. With fewer and fewer of us able to enjoy traditional pension income, it's more important than ever that we plan for our future financial security and set ourselves up to receive sufficient income when we're no longer working. Here are 10 ways you can boost your retirement income. Image source: Getty Images. You can accumulate a lot of money in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Traditional (not Roth) IRAs and 401(k)s receive pre-tax contributions. So, if you have taxable income of $75,000 and you contribute $5,000, you get to subtract that from your taxable income and avoid paying taxes on it now (you will ultimately be taxed on it upon withdrawal in retirement, when your tax rate may be lower). If you're in the 25% tax bracket and contribute $10,000 to these accounts, you'll cut your tax bill by $2,500! Roth varieties of these accounts offer no upfront tax break, but if you follow the rules, you can withdraw from them in retirement tax-free. Here's how much you might be able to accumulate over time: Growing at 8% for $5,000 Invested Annually $10,000 Invested Annually $15,000 Invested Annually 15 years $146,621 $293,243 $439,864 20 years $247,115 $494,229 $741,344 25 years $394,772 $789,544 $1.2 million 30 years $611,729 $1.2 million $1.8 million Calculations by author. A good way to have more income in retirement is to have no mortgage payments due every month. It's smart to pay off your mortgage before retiring, if you can. If you're still some years away from retiring, consider making extra payments in order to reduce your balance. It could even make sense to refinance to a 15-year loan if that will help you pay the house off sooner. Image source: Pixabay. Another option, though one with some significant drawbacks, is a reverse mortgage. With a reverse mortgage, you essentially borrow money based on your home equity and you don't have to pay it back until you die or stop living in your home. It can deliver a welcome income stream -- and a tax-free one at that, generally -- but it can mean your heirs don't get to inherit your home. Learn more about reverse mortgages if you're interested. You have to qualify for one, you may not get as much income as you'd hoped, and you'll face closing costs, but it's still a good solution for some people. Buying an annuity is a lot like buying yourself a pension. Stick with fixed annuities (that pay immediately or later), and think twice about variable or indexed annuities -- as those can have steep fees and restrictive terms and limits on growth. For $200,000, a 70-year-old couple might get an immediate fixed annuity that pays around $1,000 per month for as long as at least one of them is alive. A 70-year-old woman who spends $100,000 may get about $577 per month (that's around $6,900 per year), vs. $641 for a 70-year-old man (about $7,700 per year). Women will usually receive less because they tend to live longer than men. A fixed annuity can provide peace of mind, removing stock market moves and the economy's current condition from your worries. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to your health insurance, spend some time reading up on the topic so you can get the most bang for your buck. Once you're 65, you qualify for Medicare -- and in order to avoid paying a penalty premium every year, you need to not be late signing up. Know that you can choose between original Medicare (Part A and Part B, often with Part D and/or supplemental plans) and Medicare Advantage plans. There are pros and cons to each. For example, original Medicare is accepted across the country by thousands of doctors, whereas Medicare Advantage plans tend to be based in a region, offering access to a certain network of doctors. Medicare Advantage premiums can be lower, plus the plans feature out-of-pocket spending caps. Image source: Getty Images. Investing in stocks and bonds -- and staying invested throughout retirement -- can generate interest and dividend income for you. Remember that even at age 70, you might have another 20 years ahead of you, so it's not crazy to have some of your nest egg in stocks. A $300,000 portfolio of dividend-paying stocks with an average yield of 4% can deliver $12,000 in annual income -- plus the payouts are likely to increase over time as long as the companies remain healthy and growing. Here are some recent yields to give you an idea of what's out there: Stock Recent Dividend Yield AT&T 4.7% Verizon Communications 4.4% General Motors 4.2% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.6% IBM 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Johnson & Johnson 2.8% Microsoft 2.5% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Image source: Getty Images. Another good way to increase your income in retirement is to stay at your job for a few more years than you originally planned. That lets you keep adding to your retirement accounts -- and a fatter nest egg can generate more income. It can also keep you on your employer's health insurance plan a bit longer, possibly saving you some money for a few years, and it delays your starting to withdraw funds from your savings to live off of. If you don't want to keep working full time for a few more years, you might start your retirement by only partially withdrawing from the work force. A part-time job, for example, can keep some money flowing in during your early retirement years, boosting your income. It can also be a good way to transition into full retirement, which can be jarring for some people, with the lack of routines and the big drop-off in socializing. Even working 12 hours per week at $10 per hour can generate $120 per week -- $6,240 per year -- in extra retirement income. There are lots of other ways to boost your retirement income, some of which might not occur to many people. For example, you might rent out a room to a boarder, or just take in occasional guests as an Airbnb host. You might become an online tutor in any subjects you know well, or you might turn a hobby into a profit center, perhaps selling soaps, jewelry, sweaters, or furniture you make. You might move to a smaller, less expensive home, or perhaps even to a less expensive part of the country. If you and your spouse each have a vehicle, consider downsizing to just one, if you can swing it. Image source: Getty Images. Finally, remember that the income many of us are counting on in retirement -- Social Security -- is something you can control, to some degree. The average Social Security retirement benefit was recently $1,350 per month, or about $16,000 per year, with the maximum benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age recently at $2,639 per month -- or about $32,000 annually. You can increase or decrease your benefits by starting to collect Social Security earlier or later than your ""full"" retirement age, which is 66 or 67 for most of us, and you can make some smart moves by coordinating with your spouse when you each start collecting. (For example, you could start collecting the lower-earner's benefits first while letting the higher-earner's benefits grow larger.) Putting just a few of the strategies above into use can significantly boost your retirement income. ","

Or maybe buy into Trump’s defense-spending plans? Or even bet on one of Europe’s most hated airlines? According to a group of top fund managers, those plays are likely to offer you some of the best returns for the next year. Speaking at the Sohn Conference in London earlier in December, 14 fund managers from the U.S. and Europe each unveiled their top investment calls for the next year to a group of around 450 investors. How to benefit from president-elect Donald Trump’s expected fiscal policies was a major topic at the conference, but continued optimism over the commodity sector also featured highly among fund-manager favorites.

Croxson points to two key factors behind his Ryanair call: 1) The company’s cost structure is significantly lower than other airlines, including rival easyJet PLC

Ryanair is already Europe’s largest airline with a market share pf around 15%, but with an expanded route network to more popular airports coupled with continued low prices, Croxson expects the airline to control 25% of the European market in coming years.

U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry. “The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. “What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion.” However, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors warned that additional strong gains would be unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump’s campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit. “The president-elect can’t just wave a magic wand,” said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. “He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn’t proved to be able to agree with itself.” Oil prices hit an 18-month high before turning negative and falling more than 2 percent.

Image source: Getty Images. Though it might seem simple and straightforward, investing in top telecom stocks is far more complex than it initially seems. As we learned in an earlier two-part blueprint for investing in telecom companies, providers of wireless and landline services operate in a multifaceted, highly regulated industry. If you really want to gain an in-depth sense of the industry, I suggest the above two articles as a great starting place. However, as a quick primer, we'll review three of the most important high-level takeaways that anyone considering buying telecom stocks absolutely must consider. When it comes to winning in the telecom space, history shows time and again that size matters. The telecom industry's massive fixed costs -- and the voluminous cash flows they can eventually produce -- allow the companies with the financial resources to invest in their wireless or wireline infrastructure to maintain their competitive positions. Moreover, closing the gap between market leaders and potential challengers requires massive capital expenditures on the insurgents' parts, which can strain companies' balance sheets along the way. Here's a quick example of how this dynamic plays out among U.S. wireless providers, where AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are the entrenched incumbents, and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) desperately want to steal market share from the former. AT&T Verizon Sprint* T-Mobile Cash Flow from Operations $35.8 billion $38.9 billion $9.0 billion $5.4 billion Capital Expenditures -$19.2 billion -$17.7 billion -$7.0 billion -$4.7 billion) Free Cash Flow $16.6 billion $21.2 billion $2.0 billion $700 million Data source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch; FY 2015 data. *Denotes 12 months ending 3/31/16. To me, this is one of the most important charts in explaining the current competitive stance of the U.S. wireless market. Verizon (143 million) and AT&T (133 million) enjoy a roughly 2-to-1 wireless subscriber advantage over T-Mobile (69 million) and Sprint (59 million). As you can see, this larger scale translates into AT&T and Verizon needing to invest a far smaller percentage of their cash from operations into their networks than Sprint or T-Mobile. All of that extra free cash flow gives Verizon and AT&T the ability to invest in opportunities like Verizon's acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo!, or AT&T's DIRECTV and Time Warner buyouts. When it comes to the telecom business, it pays to be one of the top dogs over the long term. With well-known names like AT&T and Verizon sporting dividend yields more than double the market average, the telecom industry can be a paradise for income investors. However, chasing yield in this sector can be the siren song of a money-losing investment. Here, a company like rural wireline provider Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) serves as a useful cautionary tale. WIN data by YCharts. In case you've never heard of it, Windstream provides landline telephone, broadband, digital TV, and security services to 1.4 million subscribers across the rural areas of 18 states. Spun out from the now-defunct Alltel in 2006, Windstream's strategy has been to roll up as many rural fiber assets and subscribers as possible to essentially become the biggest fish in an area of the telecom industry that's in structural decline. This ""growth via merger"" model works well on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but it ultimately lies on the losing side of history. The company continues to push forward, recently announcing an all-stock merger with the similar EarthLink. However, with demand for its services declining as our digital world evolves, Windstream's core business strategy appears unsustainable over the long term. What likely first pops out when looking at Windstream is its 8% dividend yield. However, as you saw in the above chart, Windstream's temptingly high dividend yield should more appropriately be viewed as a proxy for its risk. There's a long list to support this truism -- see Alaska Communications Systems or Frontier Communications -- but chasing yield in the telecom space is a quick way for investors to lose their shirts, which segues nicely into the final point on telecom investing. The final telecom investing tip might seem obvious, but given the industry's sneakily diverse mix of companies, investors must understand in detail the business model and strategy of a given company prior to buying. Are they in a growing segment of the industry? Wireless providers and the companies that supply their infrastructure are growing, while older technologies are fading. What does their competitive positioning in that market look like? As we saw with wireless providers, AT&T and Verizon remain far stronger than T-Mobile and Sprint. Despite the wireless space's overall favorable growth characteristics, the benefits of that growth are rarely distributed evenly. At the end of the day, this harkens back to Warren Buffett's concept of a circle of competence. Investors make unintended mistakes when they don't take the time to fully understand any potential investment. The seeming simplicity and sleepiness of the telecom industry can mask the underlying complexity of the sector, much to an investors' detriment. Taking the time to dig into a company's competitive position, its dividend details (if applicable), and its business model and outlook are critical steps that can save investors from making costly missteps or, better still, help identify stocks that can earn investors thousands.

866,Daniel B. Kline,1052017,Fool,12292016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) knows how to put on a show. In fact, CEO John Legere clearly has borrowed from Steve Jobs, P.T. Barnum, and Vince McMahon to varying degrees. The outspoken wireless boss has a charisma and an arrogance that would not work if his company did not deliver on his promises. But like Muhammad Ali taunting an opponent and then knocking him out, T-Mobile does deliver. The company has added over 1 million subscribers for each of the past 15 quarters (including adding 2.1 million in Q4) while also leading rivals AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S) for most net adds for 11 straight quarters. It's an impressive performance driven by Legere's personality and the company's ongoing Un-carrier initiatives. That makes every T-Mobile press conference an event, and anticipation was running high in advance of the company's Jan. 5 ""Un-carrier Next"" event at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The stage was bathed in magenta lights in advance of the Un-carrier Next event. Image source: author. Legere concluded his taped bit by promising a big announcement. ""When you hear what I announce next, there is no way you would not want to switch,"" he said, before taking the stage to shrieks and whoops from the T-Mobile employees in the audience. ""Four years ago, I just snapped,"" he said. ""The Un-carrier took the form of a tirade. If you landed from Mars on this planet and saw how people sell wireless, you would turn around and go back."" At the time, T-Mobile was bleeding customers and losing money, the No. 4 player in the industry. ""We did not talk about a turnaround; we talked about changing wireless for good,"" Legere said. Legere took the audience on a walk through all the changes T-Mobile has pushed on the industry. He noted that most customers no longer have contracts, switching fees have been largely eliminated, and overage charges have decreased across the industry. Of course, the CEO also pointed out how AT&T and Verizon specifically fought many (if not all) of those changes before eventually giving in. For the company's latest move, dubbed Un-carrier Next, Legere told the crowd that T-Mobile has another big set of changes ahead based around the mobile internet, where he noted that 80% of all internet use happens. Calling wireless plans ""a mobile internet connection,"" Legere said that beginning on Jan. 22, T-Mobile will only sell unlimited plans. It will allow existing users to stay on their plans but is getting rid of the Simple Choice plans for new customers. He also said that ""what you see is what you should pay,"" pledging that the telecom's pricing would only advertise prices that are ""all in,"" with all taxes and fees included. ""We're doing it without raising prices,"" Legere said. ""Taxes and fees aren't going away. We're investing in our customers."" Legere showed a video featuring comedian Jason Jones going over subscribers' Verizon bills where each family paid much more than the advertised price. T-Mobile's new plans' selling point is that what you see is what you get. A family of four will pay $40 each for unlimited data, calls, and text with no extra fees for a total of $160. The company has also pledged that it won't raise prices, reduce service, or change its customers' plans without consent. In addition, if a consumer uses less than 2 GB of data in a month, they will get a $10 bill credit each month per line for up to 12 lines. This is another effort by T-Mobile to change how the industry works. The company now has an all-in-one unlimited plan with simple pricing that also takes into account users who will not be using a lot of data. It's another major shot at the rest of the industry, and it could win T-Mobile even more customers. It's also likely that dropping separate fees and offering transparent pricing could force AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint to follow suit. ","

Image source: Getty Images. Cord-cutting grew worse in 2016 as an estimated more than 750,000 customers left pay-TV for other options over the last four quarters. Few operators bucked the trend this year, but there were still a handful of standout performers in the industry. Here are three of the best cable stocks from 2016. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the few pay-TV operators that have actually added customers over the past year. For the 12 months ending on Sept. 30, Comcast added 170,000 video subscribers. It's largely benefiting from a reduced focus from Verizon and AT&T on their telecom services, which had been encroaching on Comcast's territory. Comcast's cable communications segment grew revenue 6.5% through the first nine months of 2016. Comcast has been able to raise prices for cable and internet subscribers mainly as a result of its X1 platform. The X1 set-top box offers an improved user interface for cable, integrating internet services such as on-demand streaming or live sports stats into the viewing experience. The company reports that 45% of video subscribers have the X1 box. Comcast's stock price climbed about 24% in 2016. That's well ahead of the 10% returned by the S&P 500. As one of the few pay-TV operators still adding new customers and with the advantage of owning one of the largest media companies, Comcast looks poised to continue to outperform. Charter (NASDAQ:CHTR) has lost about 57,000 video subscribers on a pro forma basis over the last four quarters. But it's transformed itself significantly in 2016 with the acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Unlike Comcast, Charter is exclusively focused on its cable business. The addition of millions of new customers gives it a much-stronger position in the industry to continue raising prices. Indeed, Charter has been able to do just that. Its average revenue per residential subscriber increased 2% year over year in the third quarter, to $109.69 per month. The addition of Time Warner Cable negatively impacted its revenue per subscriber, but Charter is quickly rebranding the business to Spectrum and bringing non-digital customers to digital in an effort to keep its prices high. Charter's stock skyrocketed in 2016 following the approval of its Time Warner Cable and Bright House acquisitions and management's strong execution. The stock price went up about 59% in 2016. With 24.5 million customer relations -- nearly one-quarter of the entire market -- Charter is well positioned to continue growing revenue through regular price increases and continued internet customer additions. It may not be able to continue growing its video subscribers, however, given the headwinds it's facing. Cable One (NYSE:CABO) is a bit different from Comcast and Charter. Not only is it a tiny cable provider with about 316,000 video subscribers, but it's losing those subscribers at a fairly rapid clip. Over the last 12 months, Cable One lost nearly 51,000 video subscribers -- almost 14% of its customer base. It's making up for the losses with data customers and business services. Cable One's data revenue increased 18.8% year over year last quarter thanks to a 1.9% increase in connections and a 16.6% rate increase. Business services revenue grew 13.2% year over year last quarter as the company continues to expand its presence in small and medium-sized businesses. As a result, Cable One's overall revenue increased 3.7% for the quarter. Cable One's management has been able to effectively control costs while raising its rates, producing outsize increases in net income. Specifically, a decline in Cable One's headcount resulted in savings of about $2.4 million. Total operating expenses climbed just 1.9% last quarter, resulting in a large growth in net income. The stock price of Cable One climbed about 41% in 2016. Management's focus on raising rates and controlling costs has worked well so far, but the rapid decrease in video subscribers is a major concern heading into 2017. Investors interested in buying stock in a cable operator in 2017 may do better with one of the larger players such as Comcast or Charter. ","

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the verge of hitting 20,000 points for the first time -- a major milestone. While most people have a general idea of what this means (the stock market is going up), the Dow's significance isn't well understood by many investors. With that in mind, here's how the Dow works, what the 20,000-point milestone represents, and what it means for your investment strategy. Image source: Getty Images. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, more commonly known as ""the Dow,"" is based on the performance of just 30 companies, which often surprises newer investors since it's considered a benchmark index for the entire U.S. stock market. Furthermore, the list of companies that make up the Dow changes from time to time. In fact, of the 12 original Dow components, only one (General Electric) is still in the index today. As of this writing on Jan. 3, 2017, here are the current components of the Dow. Another interesting characteristic of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is that it's a ""price-weighted"" index. Simply put, this means that higher-priced stocks have more of an influence over the index's performance than lower-priced ones. While the mathematics of how the Dow works can be a little confusing, let's consider one example. This is one of the biggest criticisms of the Dow. In contrast, the market-cap weighted S&P 500 places more weight on the largest companies, which many investors say is a far better way to gauge the overall performance of the stock market. It's important for investors to realize that while seeing the Dow hit 20,000 for the first time will be a psychological milestone, it's really just an arbitrary number based on a strange method of combining the performance of 30 stocks. As my colleague Sean Williams pointed out a few weeks ago, there's no more reason to celebrate Dow 20,000 than any other number that was recently reached for the first time. The bottom line is that while you're likely to see headlines celebrating Dow 20,000, it shouldn't have any effect on your investment strategy. Don't sell your stocks just because you think Dow 20,000 indicates that the market ""has gotten expensive."" If your original investment thesis still applies, there's no reason to exit any of your stock positions. Similarly, there could still be plenty of bargains to be had in the markets that are trading at low valuations, including some of the stocks in the ""Dow 30."" The index's value has no correlation with the valuations of any individual stocks. The best advice I can give for Dow 20,000 is to keep your eye on the long term. Focus on building a portfolio of attractively valued stocks and holding onto them for years. This advice will also hold true at Dow 25,000, Dow 30,000, and any other index-related milestones that may be reached during your lifetime. ","

                                   fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect. The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks.

Still, while a near-term consolidation phase has been long overdue, and remains underway, the U.S. benchmarks’ more important longer-term backdrop continues to support a firmly-bullish bias.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P staged a modest late-year pullback, closing 2016 at 2,238.8. From current levels, initial resistance holds around 2,252, and is followed by an inflection point at 2,263, matching Tuesday’s early high. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ backdrop remains slightly stronger. In its case, the blue-chip benchmark has effectively maintained its three-week range, underpinned by support around 19,750. The Dow closed last year at 19,762.6. Separately, consider that the 2016 peak missed the 20,000 mark by just 13 points. Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite has pulled in respectably from record territory, closing 2016 at 5,383.1. A posture above this level signals a year-to-date gain, and vice versa. Technically, the November peak matches a near-term inflection point, better illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has pulled in from a record high slightly above the 5,500 mark. To reiterate, the 5,400 area defines an immediate inflection point, and is followed by firmer support at 5,340, closely matching the September and October peaks. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has pulled in less aggressively. Recall that near-term support holds around 19,750, closely matching the 20-day moving average, currently 19,770. The Dow has not closed under the 20-day since Nov. 4. On further weakness, near-term support remains poorly-defined. Potential floors rest at 19,665 and 19,550, though the Dow’s first true support holds around 19,275. Conversely, the headline 20,000 mark closely matches the 2016 peak, and remains a technical hurdle. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 concluded 2016 with its first close under the 20-day moving average since Nov. 4. Based on today’s backdrop, the 20-day moving average, currently 2,249, matches a near-term inflection point, illustrated on the hourly chart. On further weakness, the 2,214 breakout point marks notable support. Broadly speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have asserted a holding pattern, digesting the steep late-2016 rally. Against this backdrop, selling pressure remains flat, so far, and recent weakness has inflicted limited damage. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   is acting well technically. Consider that the IWM closed 2016 at 134.85, just four cents above first support. More broadly, the directionally steep November breakout, and comparably flat December range, signal that bullish momentum is intact. The small-cap benchmark’s intermediate-term path of least resistance points higher. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has established a bull flag, digesting the late-2016 spike. In its case, first support spans from about 301.00 to 301.70, closely matching the late-December lows. Meanwhile, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   violated its 20-day moving average to conclude 2016 amid a seasonally uncharacteristic volume uptick. As always, the 20-day is a widely-tracked near-term trending indicator. Firmer support spans from about 221.55 to 221.80. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has concurrently notched its first close under the 20-day moving average since Nov. 4. To reiterate, the S&P’s 20-day, currently 2,249, closely matches a near-term inflection point, and remains firmly in play early Tuesday. This area defines the immediate bull-bear technical tension. Still, deeper, and more significant support, rests at the 2,214 breakout point, and the 2,190 mark, closing matching the December closing low. Within this band, the S&P’s 50-day moving average currently holds at 2,197. Recall that the 50-day effectively capped the pre U.S. election price action. Against the current backdrop, it remains a useful bull-bear gauge. Collectively, to the extent the 2,190-to-2,214 area holds — and it would be expected to hold on the first or second retest — the S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term backdrop supports a bullish bias.

873,,1122017,Reuters,1052017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

874,Donna Fuscaldo,1122017,Investopedia,1052017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) is doing away with its two-year service contracts for both new and existing customers and will require them to sign up for Verizon’s equipment installment plans (EIPs) according to a report in FierceWireless. According to FierceWireless, the telecom news website, Verizon confirmed the moves while also confirming it is increasing its activation and upgrade fees to $30 from $20. The move to get rid of two-year contracts comes at a time when most wireless carriers are scraping those plans in favor of EIPs, in which the price of the smartphone is separate than the price for wireless service. With an EIP, customers don’t get hit with interest on the phone and pay off their smartphones per month for one, two or three years. The contracts are attractive because once the phone is paid off, the monthly bill gets reduced and customers aren’t locked in with one carrier. They can take their phone to a competitor without having to break an expensive contract. FierceWireless noted that the increase in the upgrade and activation fee is likely designed to increase profits for its first quarter. The move to get rid of the two-year service contracts and, more importantly, raise the fee associated with activation and upgrade by $10 comes at a time when rival T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS), the third-place wireless carrier, is getting rid of all wireless service fees and taxes. In a move that will likely force the other carriers to respond, T-Mobile said late last week it was “completely wiping away” monthly wireless service fees including all taxes on its new T-Mobile One plan. Starting later this month, new and existing customers will pay $70 a month for the unlimited plan with additional line options available. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, a family of four will see a $20 a month savings from the change since T-Mobile isn’t raising rates to compensate for the fee and tax eliminations. (See also: T-Mobile Eliminates Fees, Taxes on Unlimited Plan.) The third-place carrier also launched KickBack, a program in which T-Mobile will pay customers back for data they don’t use. Customers who use 2 gigabytes or less a month get an up to $10 credit on the next month’s bill. “Wireless consumers pay Billions extra every year in added surcharges, taxes, monthly fees and carrier price hikes. It’s reached epidemic proportions. And, the carriers just keep inventing new ways to make their customers pay,” wrote John Legere, T-Mobile president and CEO, in a statement. “Today … we’re creating the first unlimited subscription to the Mobile Internet that works for absolutely everyone.”  ",Verizon Scraps the Two-Year Service Contract | Investopedia,0.9738

879,Michael Santoli,1122017,CNBC,1052017,"Patience is a virtue that the stock market seldom displays. The market travels in sudden bursts, not a steady pace. It gets antsy if made to sit still for a while. In football terms, investors are like an undisciplined linebacker ""overpursuing"" whatever trend they see developing - often falling flat when the trend stutter-steps. This is all relevant now because the indexes' run to record highs in recent months has been accompanied by a hopeful story line about what's to come – a rush of business-boosting policies under a President Trump and (almost as an afterthought) a sharp snapback in corporate profits as 2017 unfolds. Now that stocks appear a bit rich and the tape's momentum has slowed, it's worth asking if investors have the patience to hang on for months until it's known whether all this comes together as the bulls wish. If the market's fate comes down to getting taxes cut and regulations lifted and infrastructure spending deployed, things probably won't happen quickly enough for investors. All we have now are the unformulated proposals of a still-unformed administration, whose elected leader has not delivered a steady message about legislative priorities, to put it gently. Kim Wallace, head of Washington research at Renaissance Macro Advisors, told clients last week that he is ""skeptical on timing"" of any tax package out of Congress. ""Expect Trump to focus on tax and healthcare policy to start, but the process will be slow. We doubt anything significant is out of committee in the first half."" Six months with nothing significant reaching the House floor would probably outlast the patience of policy-focused investors. The good news, though? What we call the Trump Rally has not fully been that at all - and is probably less tied to Washington than the typical 2017 outlook commentary contends. Not only were interest rates and inflation indicators perking up starting last summer, but the election came amid the strongest run of upside economic surprises and the best levels for global manufacturing gauges in four years, notes Cornerstone Macro strategist Francois Trahan (who is among the only vocal market bears on the sell-side right now, worried that the macro improvement is priced in). There's no doubt that the election and its prospects of a fiscal jolt catalyzed and crystallized the mass recognition of a tightly wound economy gaining momentum, and better chances for the Federal Reserve to ""normalize"" interest rates. And it so happened that the obvious plays on higher growth, lower taxes, easier regulations and infrastructure investment were among the cheapest, most under-owned stocks. That sent them flying in the weeks after the election. Especially in the last month, the standard ""Trump trade"" stocks have not been lifting the indexes at all, though. Over that span, industrial and bank shares have lagged the S&P 500, while Big Tech (believed to be disadvantaged by Trumponomics) has outperformed. A basket of 16 stocks Goldman Sachs identified as the greatest beneficiaries of lower effective tax rates 
 is down 1.9 percent on average in the past month, versus a 1.2 percent gain in the S&P 500. If the S&P's latest trudge to new highs hasn't been all about policy, then the more salient question is whether the trajectory of corporate earnings and the economy alone, unenhanced by any possible goodies from Washington, could tide the market over.

880,"Brian Feroldi, Matthew DiLallo, Daniel Miller, and Dan Caplinger",1122017,Fool,1052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Income-focused investors are constantly on the hunt for stocks that offer high yields, low valuations, and durable business models that can be counted on in good times and bad. While very few stocks are capable of satisfying all of those requirements, there are a handful of businesses out there that match those criteria perfectly. Want proof? Read on to see why our team of Fools believes that National Health Investors (NYSE:NHI), Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images. Dan Caplinger (National Health Investors): Real estate investment trusts can be a good area to find high-yielding dividend stocks with relatively low-maintenance business models, but you have to know the particular space in which a REIT operates to see if its fundamentals are solid. National Health Investors specializes in providing financing for senior housing and medical facilities, including independent and assisted living facilities, memory care communities, skilled nursing facilities, medical office buildings, and specialty hospitals. Through sale-and-leaseback transactions, joint ventures, and standard debt and equity financing, National Health Investors has a portfolio of more than 200 properties across the nation and has strong relationships with operating companies to make the most of its facilities. For investors, a yield of nearly 5% is obviously attractive, but equally important is National Health Investors' growth over time. For 14 straight years, NHI has boosted its regular dividend distributions, and it has also regularly supplemented those payouts with additional amounts as well. The demographics of the U.S. population will require more senior housing in the future, and NHI is well-positioned to provide it. With so much going for its business, National Health Investors is a good way to get regular income without having to keep tabs on the company on a daily basis just to make sure things are going well with your investment. Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Renewable Partners): With a current yield of 6.2%, Brookfield Renewable Partners certainly checks off the high-yield box. Further, while may high-yield stocks appear cheap because of question marks about the sustainability of the payout, this is not the case with the hydro and wind power operator. That's because Brookfield Renewable Partners derives 90% of its cash flow from secure long-term contracts, pays out only 70% of its income through distributions, and has an investment-grade balance sheet. It's due to this firm financial footing that investors won't need to keep a close eye on this investment. However, despite its lucrative yield and healthy financial condition, Brookfield Renewable's units are cheap compared with the underlying value of its asset base: Source: Brookfield Renewable Partners inventor presentation. As that slide shows, the assets Brookfield owns typically trade for a higher value in the market than investors currently value the company's units. In other words, if the company were to replicate its business on the open market, it would need to pay between $34 and $42 per unit to do so, implying that its current sub-$30 per unit price vastly undervalues the franchise. Add it all up, and Brookfield Renewable Partners offers investors the potential for strong capital appreciation and a growing income stream without the potential headaches often associated with high-yield or value plays. Brian Feroldi (Verizon Communications): Investors who seek safety, yield, and income should really consider giving Verizon a hard look. With more than 143 million wireless subscribers on its network, Verizon enjoys the enviable position of being the top dog in the U.S. cellular market. That massive subscriber base allows Verizon to crank out far more cash flow than its smaller rivals even as it vastly outspends them on network upgrades. That means shareholders can rest easy knowing that the company will maintain its lead and be able to return huge amounts of cash to them each year. Better yet, despite its mammoth size, the company stands a good chance at putting up modest growth over the long term. My bullishness stems from Verizon's recent actions to get a foothold in the growing Internet-of-Things trend. With billions of devices set to come online over the coming years, Verizon is investing now to carve out its share of the market. Image Source: Getty Images. Down the road, the rollout of 5G connectivity could also help get the company's top line growing. After all, 5G connectivity promises to be so fast that it could cause some consumers to ditch their cable provider altogether and simply use ultra-fast wireless connections for home broadband. While we wait for those growth trends to play out, investors can sit back and enjoy the company's steady cash flow production and ever-rising rising dividend. With shares trading for only 15 times trailing earnings and offering up a juicy yield of 4.4%, Verizon is an income stock that has it all. Daniel Miller (General Motors): Despite the many stipulations this article sets forth, General Motors is probably one of the few that entirely fits the bill. Let's tackle the stipulations one at a time. First up: cheap. It's no secret that General Motors has been posting record EBIT-adjusted profits recently. In fact, since the fourth quarter of 2015 to present, it's set a record for that individual quarter and topped it by an all-time quarterly record during the second quarter of 2016. However, rather than valuing GM with a higher price relevant to those increasing profits, the market has left the stock price stuck in neutral, which has sent its price-to-earnings multiple into the low single digits. GM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts Next up: high yield. This one goes hand-in-hand with ""cheap,"" and thanks to GM's willingness to continue increasing its dividend over the past two years, at a time its stock price hasn't budged much, its yield has blossomed to roughly 4.3% -- which is lower than it's been recently thanks to a small post-election rally. GM Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YCharts Last up: babysitter not required. This might be the toughest stipulation, at least for many investors, when it comes to General Motors. However, the company has done an incredible job of making better and more efficient decisions. Its fleet sales accounted for under 20% of total sales this year, a very low level historically. It also has plans to substantially reduce its number of global platforms, and it has a goal to keep a cash pile of $20 billion on hand for rainy days. As we march through 2017, GM will need to again prove it can continue to balance inventory and keep a lid on incentive spending, all while investing intelligently for the future of autonomous vehicles and smart mobility projects. But for now we have to give management the benefit of the doubt that no babysitter is required after an impressive post-bankruptcy turnaround. ","

Kline,1122017,Fool,1052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) knows how to put on a show. In fact, CEO John Legere clearly has borrowed from Steve Jobs, P.T. Barnum, and Vince McMahon to varying degrees. The outspoken wireless boss has a charisma and an arrogance that would not work if his company did not deliver on his promises. But like Muhammad Ali taunting an opponent and then knocking him out, T-Mobile does deliver. The company has added over 1 million subscribers for each of the past 15 quarters (including adding 2.1 million in Q4) while also leading rivals AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S) for most net adds for 11 straight quarters. It's an impressive performance driven by Legere's personality and the company's ongoing Un-carrier initiatives. That makes every T-Mobile press conference an event, and anticipation was running high in advance of the company's Jan. 5 ""Un-carrier Next"" event at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The stage was bathed in magenta lights in advance of the Un-carrier Next event. Image source: author. Legere concluded his taped bit by promising a big announcement. ""When you hear what I announce next, there is no way you would not want to switch,"" he said, before taking the stage to shrieks and whoops from the T-Mobile employees in the audience. ""Four years ago, I just snapped,"" he said. ""The Un-carrier took the form of a tirade. If you landed from Mars on this planet and saw how people sell wireless, you would turn around and go back."" At the time, T-Mobile was bleeding customers and losing money, the No. 4 player in the industry. ""We did not talk about a turnaround; we talked about changing wireless for good,"" Legere said. Legere took the audience on a walk through all the changes T-Mobile has pushed on the industry. He noted that most customers no longer have contracts, switching fees have been largely eliminated, and overage charges have decreased across the industry. Of course, the CEO also pointed out how AT&T and Verizon specifically fought many (if not all) of those changes before eventually giving in. For the company's latest move, dubbed Un-carrier Next, Legere told the crowd that T-Mobile has another big set of changes ahead based around the mobile internet, where he noted that 80% of all internet use happens. Calling wireless plans ""a mobile internet connection,"" Legere said that beginning on Jan. 22, T-Mobile will only sell unlimited plans. It will allow existing users to stay on their plans but is getting rid of the Simple Choice plans for new customers. He also said that ""what you see is what you should pay,"" pledging that the telecom's pricing would only advertise prices that are ""all in,"" with all taxes and fees included. ""We're doing it without raising prices,"" Legere said. ""Taxes and fees aren't going away. We're investing in our customers."" Legere showed a video featuring comedian Jason Jones going over subscribers' Verizon bills where each family paid much more than the advertised price. T-Mobile's new plans' selling point is that what you see is what you get. A family of four will pay $40 each for unlimited data, calls, and text with no extra fees for a total of $160. The company has also pledged that it won't raise prices, reduce service, or change its customers' plans without consent. In addition, if a consumer uses less than 2 GB of data in a month, they will get a $10 bill credit each month per line for up to 12 lines. This is another effort by T-Mobile to change how the industry works. The company now has an all-in-one unlimited plan with simple pricing that also takes into account users who will not be using a lot of data. It's another major shot at the rest of the industry, and it could win T-Mobile even more customers. It's also likely that dropping separate fees and offering transparent pricing could force AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint to follow suit. ","
      
    T-Mobile Dropping Fees and Surcharges, Not Raising Prices -- The Motley Fool

Image source: John Legere's social media account. CES 2017 is now winding down, but last week T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) CEO John Legere held a press conference at the annual tech extravaganza. In it, Legere made eight bold predictions of what the telecommunications industry might have in store for 2017, and also subsequently penned a blog post on T-Mobile's site. Let's go through Legere's calls and see what they could mean for investors. Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which buy wholesale capacity from the major network operators and resell service under a different brand, have always occupied a tenuous place within the mobile value chain. Facing sluggish landline growth, many cable companies have looked toward establishing MVNOs for some exposure to wireless growth. For instance, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced plans late last year that it would launch an MVNO on Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) network in 2017, supplemented by Wi-Fi hotspots. Legere doesn't think these MVNO ambitions will play out well for anyone, and the Un-carrier will not ink any MVNO agreements with cable operators. There are a few candidates for tech giants that may look to jump into the wireless sector, but Legere thinks Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is the most obvious pick. Of course, the search giant launched Project Fi in 2015, which is a sort of hybrid MVNO that uses several networks (including T-Mobile's) in conjunction with Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is experimenting with and pioneering several interesting ideas, such as prorated data fees. Thus far, Project Fi has been limited to a small number of devices, mostly Nexus and Pixel phones, but Google has the groundwork in place if it wants to make a bigger impact. Over-the-top (OTT) streaming services are proliferating in lockstep with cord-cutting, and Legere sees the shift to mobile accelerating. The chief executive notes that a third of TV watching occurs on devices other than TVs. By the end of 2017, he believes that the majority of TV viewing will be delivered via mobile. Roughly 61% of mobile traffic is video, and this should jump to 77% by 2020, according to CTIA. T-Mobile delivers quite a bit of (downscaled) video for free via its Binge On program, so it only benefits financially from this increased usage if consumers pay extra for high-resolution streams or opt out of Binge On. DISH Network has been sitting on unused spectrum for years, fueling speculation that it would jump into the wireless world. Legere is calling for ""the end of DISH as we know it"" this year, saying it will cease to be a stand-alone entity. DISH's TV business has been on the decline, also a victim of cord-cutting, for quite some time. The company lost 116,000 net TV subscribers last quarter, and currently has about 13.6 million subscribers left. T-Mobile recently noted that it is already approaching gigabit LTE speeds, thanks to its ongoing investments in spectrum and LTE infrastructure. Other carriers are hoping for gigabit speeds on 5G, but Legere says T-Mobile will be there first using existing technologies. Of course, hitting peak theoretical speeds is quite different than what average consumers experience, and most users won't see gigabit speeds in real-world performance anytime soon. T-Mobile reached 979 Mbps in its labs, using a combination of technologies and an unreleased handset. Legere hosts a live-streamed video segment on social media every Sunday under #SlowCookerSunday. Currently, about 500,000 viewers tune in to watch him cook each week, and he predicts he'll have 1 million weekly viewers by the end of 2017. Legere uses his segment as an example of the rise of OTT content, which continues to threaten cable channels. This is a pretty bold one, but Legere predicts that three of the four CEOs of the current major wireless operators will be out by year's end. That's an ambitious forecast not only because that's a lot of CEOs losing their jobs, but also because of the ongoing consolidation speculation that T-Mobile isn't exactly downplaying. If T-Mobile ends up merging with Sprint, Legere would immediately score at least one point on this one. Pointing to the deterioration in both Verizon's and Comcast's core businesses, Legere says that the two telecom giants will be ""forced"" to entertain the idea of a blockbuster megamerger that would combine ""two of the most hated brands in America."" Note that Legere doesn't believe a deal will be officially announced or closed, but rather the pair would have ""discussions."" Seeing as how discussions of this nature often leak and spur speculation, Legere is essentially speculating on speculation. In fairness, the idea isn't out of the question altogether, given AT&T's recent moves. ","

Image source: Getty Images. If you're in your 70s, you'll likely appreciate a solid investment that can supply you with a steadily rising stream of income. One that can help support you in retirement, provide the cash to pay for the activities you enjoy, and that you can count on year after year. Fortunately, there are some stocks that fit the bill. Read on to learn about one of the best available in the market today. Image source: Verizon Communications. Given the low-risk nature of its business and its stock's current 4.2% dividend yield, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) offers investors two important benefits: capital preservation and income generation. The telecom giant's subscription-based, utility-like business generates strong and stable cash flow that helps to insulate its stock from wild price swings. This lower volatility makes it less likely an investor will suffer a large loss should an unexpected need to sell shares arise in the near-term. Moreover, Verizon's cash flows remain well insulated from the competition. Verizon's network consistently ranks as the best in the industry, even as rivals such as T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) claim that they're chipping away at its lead. That's helped Verizon continue to add postpaid wireless subscribers -- who are generally the most profitable and sought-after customers -- despite heavy promotions from T-Mobile, Sprint, and other competitors. Looking ahead, Verizon offers investors a safe-yet-attractive play on increasing internet connectivity and rising data usage. The company is well positioned to lead the transition to 5G networks, which could provide it with exciting new opportunities in the home broadband market. Additionally, Verizon has been steadily acquiring assets to strengthen its Internet of Things technology. The company is making clear progress in the segment, with revenue growth from IoT services rising 24%, to $217 million, in the third quarter. And although the business is currently small (by Verizon's standards), the massive potential of the Internet of Things could help this segment develop into a significant source of Verizon's revenue and profits in the years ahead. Together, these growth opportunities ought to help Verizon improve its already impressive cash flow generation, which should, in turn,  allow the telecom titan to continue to do what it's done consistently over the past decade: reward its shareholders with steadily rising stream of dividend income.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere at CES. Image Source: T-Mobile. John Legere provided a sneak peak at T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) quarterly numbers during his Consumer Electronics Show (CES) presentation. He spouted off numbers like 2.1 million total net adds, 1.2 million postpaid net adds, and 933,000 postpaid phone net adds. But the most interesting thing he said, in my opinion, is that he expects to overtake AT&T (NYSE:T) in total phone customers in around four or five years. If he had said something similar when he took over as CEO of T-Mobile four years ago, nobody would have believed him. Even today, it's still hard to believe. But he points out that T-Mobile is adding 5 million to 6 million phone customers every year while AT&T is standing still. At that rate, it won't be more than five years before T-Mobile surpasses AT&T's phone base. From the first quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016, AT&T managed to add 184,000 net phone subscribers across its postpaid and prepaid brands. In the same period, T-Mobile has added over 10 million new phone customers. T-Mobile is rapidly closing the gap between itself and AT&T, which currently stands at less than 29 million. That's before counting the nearly 1.5 million phone customers T-Mobile added last quarter and whatever results AT&T posts. Last year, AT&T added just 213,000 phone customers in the fourth quarter. AT&T has returned to phone subscriber growth in each of the last six quarters, however, largely on the back of its prepaid brand Cricket Wireless. Management says that it's fine trading low-end postpaid customers for prepaid customers, but the claim seems dubious. T-Mobile, meanwhile, is also experiencing stronger net adds this year. T-Mobile added 1.4 million phone customers last year compared to 1.5 million this year. Additionally, in each of the first three quarters of the year, T-Mobile added more phone customers than in the year-ago period. It's impossible to predict what will happen four or five years into the future, but right now, T-Mobile is poised to continue grabbing market share from all three of its major competitors. AT&T and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are splitting their focuses between their telecom businesses and their newer media businesses. AT&T, in particular, is investing heavily in building out its position in pay-TV with the acquisitions of DirecTV and its plan to acquire Time Warner. Meanwhile, Sprint (NYSE:S) may find it difficult to hold onto its subscribers as its ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion expires. The first customers to sign up using that promotion are just now seeing price increases. Conversely, T-Mobile just announced a pledge to never increase prices for any of its customers. Legere said T-Mobile noticed an increase in Sprint customers switching to its services last quarter. With T-Mobile's focus on providing the best value in wireless, it should continue to attract the vast majority of wireless customers to its service. Only time will tell if it surpasses AT&T's phone customer base, but it's not as crazy of a thought as it once was. ","

Kline,1122017,Fool,1052017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

Image source: Getty Images. From celebrity deaths to shocking political news, people found plenty to complain about in 2016. Me, though? I actually had a really good year. I met some incredible people, had unbelievable adventures, and learned a ton. In the financial realm, I saved responsibly (even given the crazy-high D.C. cost of living) and added quality companies to my stock portfolio. Indeed, I'd say I pretty fully met my 2016 resolution to diversify. My next challenge -- and my resolution for 2017 -- is to take a smarter approach to finding stocks to buy by creating a watchlist. Going into 2016, my portfolio was overweight in healthcare and largely packed with higher-risk growth stocks. I resolved to achieve more balance by finding stocks outside of healthcare and established, dividend-paying stocks. Overall, I think I did pretty well. Over the course of the year, in addition to adding to prior holdings, I opened positions in the following stocks: I'd give myself a B rating for following my 2016 resolution. I did diversify pretty nicely, but I'm still missing exposure to financials -- particularly since I talked a big game this time last year about getting exposure to this industry. While I did purchase Wells Fargo, I never found a replacement financials stock after I sold off my position. As I write this, healthcare is still the sector with the most representation in my holdings -- but it was narrowly trailed by consumer goods until two late-year healthcare pops reinflated that section of my portfolio. In any case, with the exception of the gaping hole of financials, the various sectors are much more evenly represented than they were going into the year. And in hindsight, this resolution was pretty wise, as my non-healthcare buys buffered the stinging biotech losses I suffered in 2016. (The broader industry, as measured by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), sank 19%.) In the past, my buying went something like this: I'd like to improve upon this process by forcing myself to be patient. I want to do my research ahead of time and come up with a list of companies that I like, along with the prices at which I'd buy in. Now, let me be very clear that I'm in no way using this list to try and time the market. I simply think I should have my research already done on a sizable list of intriguing companies before a buying opportunity presents itself. In particular, I'm looking to fill this list out with blue-chip Fool favorites like Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble, General Motors, Chevron, Verizon Communications, and Microsoft. I know relatively little about the inner workings of these businesses, but I owe it to myself to do some research and figure out what I think is an attractive price for each of them. While I'm at it, I'm going to summarize my buy thesis for each, as well as some areas to watch. This organized, systematic approach takes some of the emotion out of investing, which is a huge advantage. When a stock hits my target price, and assuming nothing has changed about the business, I'll know I want to pick up shares for great reasons, rather than being temporarily excited about a company I just researched. Who knows what 2017 will bring, but I feel confident that building a watchlist will be the best financial move I can make. ","
      
    A Smart Approach to Portfolio Diversification: My 2017 Financial Resolution -- The Motley Fool

Dividend stocks offer current income and growth potential, and the dividend stocks that you'll find among the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) are some of the best-known, highest-quality dividend payers you'll find. Rather than simply buying the entire Dow, however, many dividend investors choose instead to follow a strategy called the Dogs of the Dow. These stocks offer better yields than the Dow as a whole, and often, they've been able to outperform the Dow over the course of the year. Let's take a first look at 2017's Dogs of the Dow to see what you should watch out for over the coming year. Stock Dividend Yield Verizon 4.3% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.7% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.7% Cisco Systems 3.4% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) 3.4% IBM 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.3% Caterpillar 3.3% Merck 3.2% Data source: DogsoftheDow.com. Because of the way that the Dogs of the Dow get picked every year, you can count on seeing some turnover among the 10 stocks that make the cut. However, 2017 is a remarkably stable year for the Dogs, with just two new entrants joining eight carryover picks from 2016. Leaving the Dogs this year are Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Interestingly, neither of the two consumer giants had particularly good years, with both stocks underperforming the broader Dow in 2016. However, a combination of factors resulted in their falling to the No. 11 and 12 spots on the Dow yield list. First, the addition of Coca-Cola came from even worse performance from the beverage giant than its consumer goods peers. Coca-Cola saw its share price fall more than 3% during 2016, as ongoing challenges related to its long-struggling carbonated beverage segment continued to weigh on its prospects. The threat of greater regulation and taxation in some areas has hit Coca-Cola, and efforts to find efficiency gains haven't been adequate to give investors the optimism in the company's future prospects to justify share-price gains. Moreover, the recent strength in the U.S. dollar could once again create difficulties for Coca-Cola, given how much it relies on foreign currency for its revenue and profits. The much more unusual move in the Dogs came from Boeing, which saw its yield jump not because of a decline in share price but rather from a huge raise that the aerospace giant made late in the year. Boeing boosted its quarterly payout in December by 30%, making its quarterly payout $1.42 per share. That helped send its yield up by more than a full percentage point compared to where it started 2016, despite Boeing's solid share-price increase of 8% for the year. The move shows how much confidence Boeing has in its recent success, despite some concerns among investors that the volume of new orders in the future might begin to slow from its breakneck pace of recent years. Image source: Getty Images. You can't count on the Dogs of the Dow always beating the entire Dow, but it has had a recent string of good outcomes. For 2016, the strategy led to a rise of about 16%, topping the 13% gain in the overall Dow. Moreover, the Dogs paid higher dividends that gave the strategy another percentage point of outperformance compared to the overall Dow. That good result brought the Dogs of the Dow's track record to six wins in seven years. The strategy didn't manage to match the Dow in 2012, and in 2014, it took the added returns from dividends for the Dogs to pull ahead. A small win in 2015 also didn't bring much outperformance, but better performance in 2010, 2011, and 2013 has many investors convinced that the Dogs of the Dow are back for good. Yet when you go back 20 years, the win-loss record is much closer to .500 than investors would like to see. The main reason to follow the Dogs of the Dow is that it's a simple way to get performance that's roughly in line with the Dow. Some years will be winners and others losers, but if you want a conservative dividend strategy that emphasizes blue-chip stocks, it's hard to beat the Dogs of the Dow. ","

888,,1122017,MarketWatch,1052017,"Yahoo was already a shell of its former self. Now part of the company is getting an obscure new name: Altaba. When Verizon agreed to buy the company for $4.8 billion in July, it planned to purchase just Yahoo's core Internet businesses, which include its email service, sports verticals and various apps. What's left of the embattled technology company would essentially be its ownership in the very valuable Chinese Internet giant Alibaba. When the deal closes, the remaining part will change its name to Altaba, the company announced in security filings on Monday. The sale is expected to be completed by late March, Yahoo said. The new name is meant to be a combination of the words “alternative and Alibaba,” according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on the record about the name change. Today Yahoo owns roughly 15 percent of Alibaba, holdings that are worth about $35 billion. The idea behind the name is that Altaba’s stock can now be tracked as an alternative to Alibaba because Yahoo owns a sizable chunk of the Chinese company. The name change reflects just how far Yahoo has fallen. The company that was once an Internet giant and is still the third most visited Web property in the United States is now essentially a vehicle for holding Alibaba's stock. The new company, which will be publicly traded and until now has been referred to as RemainCo in security filings, also owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, the company’s Japanese affiliate, and Yahoo’s cash, as well as a patent portfolio that is being sold off in a separate auction. A Yahoo spokeswoman, Suzanne Philion, would not comment on the name. She emailed the following statement: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” The company also announced in the filings that Eric Brandt is now the chairman of Yahoo's board. He is a former finance chief of semiconductor company Broadcom. Marissa Mayer remains chief executive and plans to step down from the board when the deal closes.

Mayer, for what it is worth, said she wanted to stay at Yahoo after the Verizon deal was announced. However, Verizon is only buying the core business of Yahoo, and the company owns a lot more than that.

The $30 billion-plus entity that holds on to all of that, which will exist only if the deal with Verizon goes through, would eventually be called Altaba. Altaba, though, will do virtually nothing but hold these assets, as what is known as “an investment company.” Because there is little decision-making involved in being basically a ticker symbol, Altaba does not need a full board of directors, so it will slash the size of the current Yahoo board in half. Among those who will no longer be on the board are Mayer, who could still be acting as the head of Yahoo under Verizon leadership, and Yahoo co-founder David Filo. “His or her intention to resign is not due to any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practice,” Yahoo noted in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing that launched a thousand confusing tweets. So Yahoo will still be Yahoo, Altaba will be a zombie company comprising a bunch of assets and few, if any, tasks, and Mayer may or may not still be running the actual Yahoo. No matter what anyone on Twitter says. ","Altaba, explained: Yahoo will still be Yahoo, and Marissa Mayer is still CEO (for now) - MarketWatch",0.1625
890,Jack Hough,1122017,MarketWatch,1052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

                                   launched in 2011. “But investors are stepping on the gas with valuations high. If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016). Since then, the iShares Russell 1000 Value exchange-traded fund

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

                                   Four out of the top five holdings are financials, a group that stands to benefit from rising interest rates and looser regulation under the next ­president. The fund lagged behind the S&P 500 in both 2014 and 2015 but trounced it last year, and is now ahead by two percentage points a year on average over the past five years. The GoodHaven fund is managed by a pair of alumni from the Fairholme fund, which is known for concentrated positions and spectacular periods of over- and underperformance, mostly the former. This has added up to long-term returns well ahead of the market, but also plenty of discomfort along the way. Launched in 2011, GoodHaven, too, is keeping things interesting. Last year, it beat the S&P 500 by eight percentage points. The year before it trailed by 20.

Its managers start with an index portfolio and then slightly tweak weightings according to valuation, momentum, and other factors. That kept the fund from getting clobbered in 2015 but also helped it outperform the S&P 500 by more than four percentage points last year. Fees are blessedly low at 0.23%. That compares with 1.13% for the average large-cap value fund. Vanguard U.S. Value isn’t a closet indexer.

                                   has pulled in modestly from the 20,000 mark. The index topped last week at 19,999.63 — just 0.37 points under the milestone — and has subsequently extended the pullback to first support. From current levels, the Dow’s first notable floor holds around 19,750, an area also illustrated on the daily chart. Looking elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite has sustained a slight break to record territory, outpacing the S&P and the Dow. First support rests at the December peak of 5,512, and is followed by a deeper floor at 5,487, matching the Nasdaq’s former record close. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has confirmed its uptrend, reaching another all-time high. Consider that a projected target of 5,570 is within striking distance. Conversely, support broadly spans from 5,487 to 5,512, and is followed by an inflection point matching the 20-day moving average, currently 5,462. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark topped last week at 19,999. Technically, notable resistance spans from the December peak of 19,987 to the 20,000 mark. Conversely, the Dow has maintained a posture atop the 20-day moving average, currently 19,884, on a closing basis. The index has not closed under the 20-day since Nov. 4. Also recall that firmer support holds around 19,750, detailed previously. Similarly, the S&P 500 has pulled in from a nominal record high. Consider that its one-month range effectively spans from about 2,250 to 2,277. The index has tried to break lower, and higher, thus far concluding with a bull-bear stalemate. Separately, the S&P’s 50-day moving average, currently 2,210, closely matches notable support at 2,214. Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are off to a constructive 2017 start. Each index reached all-time highs last week, and the ensuing selling pressure remains muted. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF

                                   has thus far sustained its breakout. Recall that first support matches the 2016 close of 134.85. The IWM closed Monday five cents lower, at 134.80, and has maintained support with Tuesday’s early upturn. Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is digesting the 2016 breakout. The prevailing pullback has been fueled by decreased volume, thus far inflicting no real damage. Notable support matches the late-December low of 301.05. (The 2016 close rests at 301.73.) Beyond the details, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture backdrop supports a firmly-bullish bias. Consider that the Nasdaq Composite has confirmed its uptrend, notching consecutive all-time closing highs. The breakout has been fueled by a FANG stocks resurgence — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — detailed Monday. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 have registered nominal record highs, without truly breaking out. Still, the price action is constructive against the current backdrop. And notably, the prevailing bull trend has recently weathered a retail sector downdraft, familiar political uncertainty, and a very early batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports. Tactically, initial S&P 500 support rests at 2,252, and is followed by the late-December low of 2,233. This is followed by deeper, and more significant support, spanning from S&P 2,190 to 2,214. (Recall that the December closing low held at 2,191.) The S&P 500’s intermediate-term technical bias points firmly higher barring a violation. The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Profiled last week — as attractive on a pullback — the iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF is acting well technically.

The ensuing pullback has been fueled by decreased volume, placing the group at an attractive entry near the breakout point, and 4% under the January peak. More broadly, the group has reached much less-charted territory, illustrated on the monthly chart, opening the path to potentially material intermediate-term follow-through.

                                   has edged to 52-week highs. But practically speaking, the shares have reached a major technical test. At the risk of too much detail, consider that significant resistance rests at the 2014 peak of 119.75, an area closely matching the 2016 peak of 118.69. More plainly, major overhead rests slightly under the 120 mark, and is currently under siege. Against this backdrop, the shares are rising from an orderly three-week range, underpinned by support matching the bottom of the October gap. A constructive posture. At the same time, Apple’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has reached nearly four-month highs — its best levels since mid-September — improving the chances of eventually more decisive follow-through.

892,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

898,Leo Sun,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The FCC recently declared that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ""sponsored data"" programs -- which exclude their own streaming media from data caps -- violate net neutrality rules. Many streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) believe that practice, also called ""zero rating"", gives telcos an unfair advantage as they expand into the streaming market with their own data-free content. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T lets other companies zero rate their content across its networks for a fee, but the FCC claims that those fees are much higher than the ones it charges its own subsidiary, DirecTV. The FCC also expressed similar concerns about Verizon's comparable FreeBee Data 360 program. Will the FCC actually force AT&T and Verizon to drop its sponsored data strategies, or does all this sound and fury signify nothing? Sponsored data lets AT&T bundle together its wireless and DirecTV platforms. To build the foundation of that ecosystem, AT&T started offering unlimited wireless data plans for DirecTV subscribers. All streaming DirecTV content was then zero rated for AT&T wireless customers, and AT&T launched new streaming platforms like DirecTV Now -- a $35 per month service with 100 channels -- to expand that ecosystem. By zero rating all that content, AT&T enables its customers to watch DirecTV across mobile devices, PCs, and TVs without worrying about data caps. That gives it a distinct advantage against Netflix, which is throttling the quality of its own content and letting users download videos locally to reduce their data usage. This is why AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion last year. By adding HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, and other content to that zero rated ecosystem, AT&T could create a prisoner-taking media ecosystem which widens its moat against Netflix and its competing carriers. But if regulators force AT&T to stop zero rating its own content, its DirecTV platforms could become less competitive, and the Time Warner buyout would become much less appealing. Like AT&T, Verizon is building a zero rated ecosystem for selling advertisements and streaming videos. That's why it acquired AOL in 2015, which it plans to merge with Yahoo's internet business if that long-delayed deal finally closes. Verizon has integrated video content from those companies into go90, a mobile video app it launched in late 2015. It subsequently zero rated that app for its wireless subscribers to counter AT&T's DirecTV push. Verizon also started offering data-free streaming of NFL games through the NFL Mobile app. To address criticisms about those apps violating net neutrality, Verizon launched the FreeBee Data 360 program, which let other companies pay to zero rate their own content across its networks. The FCC's ruling is a harsh condemnation of AT&T and Verizon's sponsored data strategies, but it probably won't mean much in the long run. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will be replaced on Jan. 20, and his likely successor, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, said that the report ""does not reflect the views of the majority of Commissioners."" Pai also claimed that such ""midnight regulations"" were ""sad"". AT&T and Verizon have both repeatedly defended their sponsored data programs as consumer-friendly ones that let subscribers watch video without racking up data fees. However, both telcos clearly depend on these plans to expand their ecosystems, squeeze out more revenue per user (via ads or add-on services), and offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless subscribers. The FCC report probably won't lead to any regulatory actions against AT&T and Verizon, but it reveals how heavily both companies are leveraging their dominance of wireless networks to build content-rich digital ecosystems. That strategy could help them counter streaming rivals like Netflix, which have piggybacked off their networks while convincing customers to drop their traditional pay TV services. But it could also corral consumers within telco-controlled streaming ecosystems -- an anti-competitive move which could be tough for Netflix (which lacks the ISP infrastructure) to retaliate.

    Will AT&T and Verizon's Sponsored Data Dreams Be Crushed? -- The Motley Fool

899,Adam Levy,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) management expects 2017 to be another year of solid revenue growth for the third-place carrier. ""We're looking at another year of very significant value creation,"" CFO Braxton Carter said at a recent investors conference hosted by Citi. Carter expects T-Mobile's service revenue -- the money customers pay for their plans -- to grow in the double digits, yet again, in 2017, which will ultimately translate into a sustainable ramp up in cash flow. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors have seen service revenue decline. AT&T's (NYSE:T) service revenue declined 0.9% in the third quarter, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) fell 5.2%, and Sprint's (NYSE:S) fell 6.8%. Comparatively, T-Mobile increased service revenue 13.2% in the third quarter. Here are five reasons why T-Mobile expects that trend to continue. The easiest way to increase service revenue is to bring on more subscribers. Over the past few years, no wireless carrier has done a better job than T-Mobile. In 2016, T-Mobile added 8.2 million total customers, 3.3 million of which are the extremely high-value postpaid phone subscribers. In fact, T-Mobile boasts that it captured over 100% of the postpaid phone net additions across the industry in both 2016 and 2015. (Other carriers -- specifically AT&T -- lost postpaid phone subscribers during those years.) There's no indication that the trend is slowing in 2017. If anything, T-Mobile stands to gain from the expiration of Sprint's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion for its earliest sign-ups. CEO John Legere has already noted an increase in switchers from Sprint to T-Mobile in the fourth quarter. AT&T and Verizon's split focus on wireless and media ensures T-Mobile will be able to fill in more pain points and continue funneling customers away from the larger carriers. T-Mobile's most recent Un-Carrier move, announced at CES earlier this month, is to include taxes and fees in its pricing. It's also doing away with its Simple Choice plans with data buckets, and only offering its unlimited data T-Mobile One plan. Carter believes the latest move, dubbed All In, ""will set the stage for very nice front-end growth"" in 2017. T-Mobile is betting on a simple pricing structure to front-load its subscriber growth in 2017. If Carter is correct, it would result in sustained service-revenue growth throughout the year. The other benefit of getting rid of Simple Choice plans is that customers will be forced to choose T-Mobile's more expensive plan. During the third quarter, when T-Mobile introduced its T-Mobile One plan, it saw a 2.2% sequential increase in average revenue per postpaid phone subscriber. And Carter points out the new service plan was only available for one month that quarter. While including taxes and fees in its new pricing seems like it could be a price cut, T-Mobile has also done away with its $5 per-line autopay discount. Effectively, it's replacing one pricing promotion with another. As a result, the new All In promotion shouldn't impact average revenue per user (ARPU) on T-Mobile One accounts very much. T-Mobile currently has the lowest ARPU in the industry for postpaid phone subscribers, as seen in the table below. Wireless Carrier Postpaid Phone ARPU Q3 2016 AT&T $59.64 Sprint $58.03 Verizon $47.52* T-Mobile $48.15 *Includes lower-value connections like tablets and IoT devices.Source: Company earnings reports. There's clearly room for T-Mobile to increase its ARPU, but it's also been able to put pressure on its competitors' ARPU. The result is a growing T-Mobile customer base that's also paying more per month, on average. T-Mobile dramatically improved its network coverage in 2016, but its retail footprint hasn't quite caught up with its network. Carter says the company plans to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores by mid-2017. Since T-Mobile's marketing campaigns are all done on a nationwide scale, it already has strong brand recognition in those areas, which generally have lower competition. Carter estimates the additional stores will reach 30 million to 40 million potential customers, which could add meaningful growth to its subscriber base. When it comes to grabbing share of the enterprise market, Verizon and AT&T are dominant forces. Carter says, ""We still index very low on B2B [business to business]."" T-Mobile has taken less than 5% of the marketplace. AT&T counts 50 million postpaid connections in its Business Solutions segment. In fact, AT&T's business customers outnumber its retail wireless customers. While business customers are harder to convert than retail customers due to the need to convert so many people at once, T-Mobile is much better positioned to win these valuable contracts than just two years ago. It may be a slow process, but investors should look for enterprise customers to add meaningfully to service revenue in 2017 and beyond. Overall, T-Mobile is poised for another strong year of service-revenue growth as its competitors struggle to tread water. ","

Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

902,Daniel B. Kline,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

903,Mark Hulbert,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

904,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits.

Even at the top range of that range, a yield of 3.90% isn’t very attractive, especially if rates continue to rise, pushing down prices and creating the potential for losses for those who don’t hold bonds to maturity.

This left us with 164 stocks. We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

906,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:51 a.m. ET Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings values and high rates of earnings growth By In a recent interview, Erick Ormsby, the founder of Alcosta Capital Management, looked ahead by a year and based several stock picks on companies expected to post double-digit earnings growth in 2018. The companies were also trading at relatively low price-to-forward earnings valuations. So we decided to follow up by applying similar criteria to the entire S&P 500 Index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -0.15% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade. (As always, gold and the U.S. dollar are inversely correlated.)

908,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

914,Leo Sun,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The FCC recently declared that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) ""sponsored data"" programs -- which exclude their own streaming media from data caps -- violate net neutrality rules. Many streaming companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) believe that practice, also called ""zero rating"", gives telcos an unfair advantage as they expand into the streaming market with their own data-free content. Image source: Getty Images. AT&T lets other companies zero rate their content across its networks for a fee, but the FCC claims that those fees are much higher than the ones it charges its own subsidiary, DirecTV. The FCC also expressed similar concerns about Verizon's comparable FreeBee Data 360 program. Will the FCC actually force AT&T and Verizon to drop its sponsored data strategies, or does all this sound and fury signify nothing? Sponsored data lets AT&T bundle together its wireless and DirecTV platforms. To build the foundation of that ecosystem, AT&T started offering unlimited wireless data plans for DirecTV subscribers. All streaming DirecTV content was then zero rated for AT&T wireless customers, and AT&T launched new streaming platforms like DirecTV Now -- a $35 per month service with 100 channels -- to expand that ecosystem. By zero rating all that content, AT&T enables its customers to watch DirecTV across mobile devices, PCs, and TVs without worrying about data caps. That gives it a distinct advantage against Netflix, which is throttling the quality of its own content and letting users download videos locally to reduce their data usage. This is why AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion last year. By adding HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, and other content to that zero rated ecosystem, AT&T could create a prisoner-taking media ecosystem which widens its moat against Netflix and its competing carriers. But if regulators force AT&T to stop zero rating its own content, its DirecTV platforms could become less competitive, and the Time Warner buyout would become much less appealing. Like AT&T, Verizon is building a zero rated ecosystem for selling advertisements and streaming videos. That's why it acquired AOL in 2015, which it plans to merge with Yahoo's internet business if that long-delayed deal finally closes. Verizon has integrated video content from those companies into go90, a mobile video app it launched in late 2015. It subsequently zero rated that app for its wireless subscribers to counter AT&T's DirecTV push. Verizon also started offering data-free streaming of NFL games through the NFL Mobile app. To address criticisms about those apps violating net neutrality, Verizon launched the FreeBee Data 360 program, which let other companies pay to zero rate their own content across its networks. The FCC's ruling is a harsh condemnation of AT&T and Verizon's sponsored data strategies, but it probably won't mean much in the long run. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will be replaced on Jan. 20, and his likely successor, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, said that the report ""does not reflect the views of the majority of Commissioners."" Pai also claimed that such ""midnight regulations"" were ""sad"". AT&T and Verizon have both repeatedly defended their sponsored data programs as consumer-friendly ones that let subscribers watch video without racking up data fees. However, both telcos clearly depend on these plans to expand their ecosystems, squeeze out more revenue per user (via ads or add-on services), and offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless subscribers. The FCC report probably won't lead to any regulatory actions against AT&T and Verizon, but it reveals how heavily both companies are leveraging their dominance of wireless networks to build content-rich digital ecosystems. That strategy could help them counter streaming rivals like Netflix, which have piggybacked off their networks while convincing customers to drop their traditional pay TV services. But it could also corral consumers within telco-controlled streaming ecosystems -- an anti-competitive move which could be tough for Netflix (which lacks the ISP infrastructure) to retaliate.

915,Adam Levy,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image Source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) management expects 2017 to be another year of solid revenue growth for the third-place carrier. ""We're looking at another year of very significant value creation,"" CFO Braxton Carter said at a recent investors conference hosted by Citi. Carter expects T-Mobile's service revenue -- the money customers pay for their plans -- to grow in the double digits, yet again, in 2017, which will ultimately translate into a sustainable ramp up in cash flow. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors have seen service revenue decline. AT&T's (NYSE:T) service revenue declined 0.9% in the third quarter, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) fell 5.2%, and Sprint's (NYSE:S) fell 6.8%. Comparatively, T-Mobile increased service revenue 13.2% in the third quarter. Here are five reasons why T-Mobile expects that trend to continue. The easiest way to increase service revenue is to bring on more subscribers. Over the past few years, no wireless carrier has done a better job than T-Mobile. In 2016, T-Mobile added 8.2 million total customers, 3.3 million of which are the extremely high-value postpaid phone subscribers. In fact, T-Mobile boasts that it captured over 100% of the postpaid phone net additions across the industry in both 2016 and 2015. (Other carriers -- specifically AT&T -- lost postpaid phone subscribers during those years.) There's no indication that the trend is slowing in 2017. If anything, T-Mobile stands to gain from the expiration of Sprint's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion for its earliest sign-ups. CEO John Legere has already noted an increase in switchers from Sprint to T-Mobile in the fourth quarter. AT&T and Verizon's split focus on wireless and media ensures T-Mobile will be able to fill in more pain points and continue funneling customers away from the larger carriers. T-Mobile's most recent Un-Carrier move, announced at CES earlier this month, is to include taxes and fees in its pricing. It's also doing away with its Simple Choice plans with data buckets, and only offering its unlimited data T-Mobile One plan. Carter believes the latest move, dubbed All In, ""will set the stage for very nice front-end growth"" in 2017. T-Mobile is betting on a simple pricing structure to front-load its subscriber growth in 2017. If Carter is correct, it would result in sustained service-revenue growth throughout the year. The other benefit of getting rid of Simple Choice plans is that customers will be forced to choose T-Mobile's more expensive plan. During the third quarter, when T-Mobile introduced its T-Mobile One plan, it saw a 2.2% sequential increase in average revenue per postpaid phone subscriber. And Carter points out the new service plan was only available for one month that quarter. While including taxes and fees in its new pricing seems like it could be a price cut, T-Mobile has also done away with its $5 per-line autopay discount. Effectively, it's replacing one pricing promotion with another. As a result, the new All In promotion shouldn't impact average revenue per user (ARPU) on T-Mobile One accounts very much. T-Mobile currently has the lowest ARPU in the industry for postpaid phone subscribers, as seen in the table below. Wireless Carrier Postpaid Phone ARPU Q3 2016 AT&T $59.64 Sprint $58.03 Verizon $47.52* T-Mobile $48.15 *Includes lower-value connections like tablets and IoT devices.Source: Company earnings reports. There's clearly room for T-Mobile to increase its ARPU, but it's also been able to put pressure on its competitors' ARPU. The result is a growing T-Mobile customer base that's also paying more per month, on average. T-Mobile dramatically improved its network coverage in 2016, but its retail footprint hasn't quite caught up with its network. Carter says the company plans to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores by mid-2017. Since T-Mobile's marketing campaigns are all done on a nationwide scale, it already has strong brand recognition in those areas, which generally have lower competition. Carter estimates the additional stores will reach 30 million to 40 million potential customers, which could add meaningful growth to its subscriber base. When it comes to grabbing share of the enterprise market, Verizon and AT&T are dominant forces. Carter says, ""We still index very low on B2B [business to business]."" T-Mobile has taken less than 5% of the marketplace. AT&T counts 50 million postpaid connections in its Business Solutions segment. In fact, AT&T's business customers outnumber its retail wireless customers. While business customers are harder to convert than retail customers due to the need to convert so many people at once, T-Mobile is much better positioned to win these valuable contracts than just two years ago. It may be a slow process, but investors should look for enterprise customers to add meaningfully to service revenue in 2017 and beyond. Overall, T-Mobile is poised for another strong year of service-revenue growth as its competitors struggle to tread water. ","

Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

918,Daniel B. Kline,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails. Since Nov. 8, the S&P 500 Index

                                   has gained an impressive 6.3% and the Nasdaq Composite 7.3%. The lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500, in contrast, have gained only 2.8%. Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified. The two largest such ETFs are the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF

920,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 15, 2017 7:49 a.m. ET Overseas blue-chip dividend stocks are better buys now, says Michael Binger of Gradient Investments By Back in May, Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager with Gradient Investments LLC, told MarketWatch about six of his favorite dividend stocks at that time. Binger’s outlook has changed a bit since then, and he thinks dividend stocks as a group are looking pricey. He’s now looking beyond the U.S. for attractively valued dividend stocks. The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

According to FactSet, the company’s free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

921,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:50 a.m. ET A deep dive yields generous income-producing stocks coupled with some downside protection By Income-hungry investors continue to flock to stocks over bonds, where yields, while rising, remain relatively low. But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits. And if a high dividend-payer’s sales and profits are also increasing, so much the better. Meanwhile, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds range from 75 to 150 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasury notes

We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations.

The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

                                   hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P is traversing its range. The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59. Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500

                                   has also flatlined just under record highs. Recall that last week’s low of 224.96 closely matched first support around the 225 mark. The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade.

924,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Straight Path Communications Inc, a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, said it has settled with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, resolving an investigation into the company. As part of the settlement, Straight Path will pay $15 million to the FCC and give the regulator a 20 percent cut of any sale of its spectrum licenses, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The FCC had made inquiries into Straight Path’s former parent company IDT Corp and its spectrum licenses following allegations of fraud that were made against the company by an anonymous shortseller. Straight Path’s main asset is its licenses for airwaves that could be used by wireless operators in emerging 5G technology. Wireless providers such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are hungry for airwaves to help them expand their networks. In July 2016, the FCC made a rule change that allowed for the 28GHz and 39GHz bands, a major part of Straight Path’s spectrum holdings, to be used in mobile communications. Straight Path is also hiring investment bank Evercore Partners Inc to help the company explore strategic alternatives. As part of the consent decree, if Straight Path does not announce the sale of its spectrum licenses in the next 12 months, it will have to pay the FCC $85 million or return its licenses. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve a comprehensive settlement with the FCC, which allows us to move forward,” Chief Executive Davidi Jonas said in the statement. The settlement may put an end to some of the uncertainty surrounding the company, whose stock seesawed in late 2015 from $50 to less than $8. Besides the anonymous shortseller, it had also been targeted by New York-based Kerrisdale, a $400 million hedge fund that shorts stocks publicly. Shares in Straight Path closed 5.6 percent lower at $31.41 per share on Wednesday.   (Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) ","

(TMUS) and Sprint Corporation (S) may be the third- and fourth-place U.S. wireless carriers, but they are chipping away at the dominance AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), and more of that is expected to come in 2017 whether or not the two ending up merging. Pacific Crest Securities, which recently raised its fourth-quarter subscriber numbers for both T-Mobile and Sprint, expects more market-share gains, pointing to recent promotions and a focus on unlimited data plans as ways to grab business from the likes of AT&T and Verizon. “Unlimited data is what consumers desire. It is becoming a differentiating factor, with Verizon the only carrier not offering unlimited data, and AT&T only offering it in limited fashion,” wrote Pacific Crest analysts Michael Bowen and Brandon Nispel said in a research note published by Barron’s. “Consumers are tired of being hit with overages and fees from using their data plan. Our survey has found a sharp increase in the amount of unlimited data customers, which we expect will continue to trend higher.” Recognizing a movement to unlimited and a frustration with fees, T-Mobile announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that it was getting rid of fees and taxes on its unlimited plans, which will eventually force the other carriers to respond. Sprint had its own news during the annual technology confab, announcing it will let customers put more than one number on a single device and is working with cloud-based platform Movius to provide the service. The wireless carrier also announced a promotion last week in which it will give families up to $800 in gift cards when they switch to a unlimited data, talk and text plan. (See also: Sprint Offers $800 Sign-Up Bonus for Certain Plans.) According to the Pacific Crest Securities analysts, in 2017 the big carriers are going to have a tough time gaining or keeping subscribers with Verizon having a better go of it than AT&T. The analysts said there is a chance Verizon will post a slight upside to its estimates for postpaid-phone net additions in the fourth quarter, but it could still be disappointing to investors. AT&T, on the other hand, is projected to lose 330,000 postpaid phones subscribers. “Net losses at AT&T and the struggles at Verizon indicate T-Mobile and Sprint should take share; 2017 brings a new year, but competition will persist,” said the analysts noting that Sprint should see the most gains while T-Mobile will still be “market share taker” during the year.

The video-streaming service blew past quarterly subscriber expectations, as it celebrated a decade of being online. After burning through still more cash, its share price soared to a new high. Apparently growth can come at almost any cost. The $57 billion company led by Reed Hastings added 7.1 million new customers after many initially blanched at a price increase last year. Both in the United States and internationally, Netflix surpassed its own forecast, tallying nearly 94 million for the quarter ending Dec. 31. It was 10 years ago that Hastings disrupted his own groundbreaking DVD mailing service by making the big bet that people would watch movies and TV shows using an internet connection instead.

The FCC also expressed similar concerns about Verizon's comparable FreeBee Data 360 program. Will the FCC actually force AT&T and Verizon to drop its sponsored data strategies, or does all this sound and fury signify nothing? Sponsored data lets AT&T bundle together its wireless and DirecTV platforms. To build the foundation of that ecosystem, AT&T started offering unlimited wireless data plans for DirecTV subscribers. All streaming DirecTV content was then zero rated for AT&T wireless customers, and AT&T launched new streaming platforms like DirecTV Now -- a $35 per month service with 100 channels -- to expand that ecosystem. By zero rating all that content, AT&T enables its customers to watch DirecTV across mobile devices, PCs, and TVs without worrying about data caps. That gives it a distinct advantage against Netflix, which is throttling the quality of its own content and letting users download videos locally to reduce their data usage. This is why AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) for $85 billion last year. By adding HBO, CNN, Warner Bros. movies, and other content to that zero rated ecosystem, AT&T could create a prisoner-taking media ecosystem which widens its moat against Netflix and its competing carriers. But if regulators force AT&T to stop zero rating its own content, its DirecTV platforms could become less competitive, and the Time Warner buyout would become much less appealing. Like AT&T, Verizon is building a zero rated ecosystem for selling advertisements and streaming videos. That's why it acquired AOL in 2015, which it plans to merge with Yahoo's internet business if that long-delayed deal finally closes. Verizon has integrated video content from those companies into go90, a mobile video app it launched in late 2015. It subsequently zero rated that app for its wireless subscribers to counter AT&T's DirecTV push. Verizon also started offering data-free streaming of NFL games through the NFL Mobile app. To address criticisms about those apps violating net neutrality, Verizon launched the FreeBee Data 360 program, which let other companies pay to zero rate their own content across its networks. The FCC's ruling is a harsh condemnation of AT&T and Verizon's sponsored data strategies, but it probably won't mean much in the long run. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will be replaced on Jan. 20, and his likely successor, Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, said that the report ""does not reflect the views of the majority of Commissioners."" Pai also claimed that such ""midnight regulations"" were ""sad"". AT&T and Verizon have both repeatedly defended their sponsored data programs as consumer-friendly ones that let subscribers watch video without racking up data fees. However, both telcos clearly depend on these plans to expand their ecosystems, squeeze out more revenue per user (via ads or add-on services), and offset their slowing growth in postpaid wireless subscribers. The FCC report probably won't lead to any regulatory actions against AT&T and Verizon, but it reveals how heavily both companies are leveraging their dominance of wireless networks to build content-rich digital ecosystems. That strategy could help them counter streaming rivals like Netflix, which have piggybacked off their networks while convincing customers to drop their traditional pay TV services. But it could also corral consumers within telco-controlled streaming ecosystems -- an anti-competitive move which could be tough for Netflix (which lacks the ISP infrastructure) to retaliate.

    Will AT&T and Verizon's Sponsored Data Dreams Be Crushed? -- The Motley Fool

Image Source: T-Mobile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) management expects 2017 to be another year of solid revenue growth for the third-place carrier. ""We're looking at another year of very significant value creation,"" CFO Braxton Carter said at a recent investors conference hosted by Citi. Carter expects T-Mobile's service revenue -- the money customers pay for their plans -- to grow in the double digits, yet again, in 2017, which will ultimately translate into a sustainable ramp up in cash flow. Meanwhile, T-Mobile's competitors have seen service revenue decline. AT&T's (NYSE:T) service revenue declined 0.9% in the third quarter, Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) fell 5.2%, and Sprint's (NYSE:S) fell 6.8%. Comparatively, T-Mobile increased service revenue 13.2% in the third quarter. Here are five reasons why T-Mobile expects that trend to continue. The easiest way to increase service revenue is to bring on more subscribers. Over the past few years, no wireless carrier has done a better job than T-Mobile. In 2016, T-Mobile added 8.2 million total customers, 3.3 million of which are the extremely high-value postpaid phone subscribers. In fact, T-Mobile boasts that it captured over 100% of the postpaid phone net additions across the industry in both 2016 and 2015. (Other carriers -- specifically AT&T -- lost postpaid phone subscribers during those years.) There's no indication that the trend is slowing in 2017. If anything, T-Mobile stands to gain from the expiration of Sprint's ""Cut Your Bill in Half"" promotion for its earliest sign-ups. CEO John Legere has already noted an increase in switchers from Sprint to T-Mobile in the fourth quarter. AT&T and Verizon's split focus on wireless and media ensures T-Mobile will be able to fill in more pain points and continue funneling customers away from the larger carriers. T-Mobile's most recent Un-Carrier move, announced at CES earlier this month, is to include taxes and fees in its pricing. It's also doing away with its Simple Choice plans with data buckets, and only offering its unlimited data T-Mobile One plan. Carter believes the latest move, dubbed All In, ""will set the stage for very nice front-end growth"" in 2017. T-Mobile is betting on a simple pricing structure to front-load its subscriber growth in 2017. If Carter is correct, it would result in sustained service-revenue growth throughout the year. The other benefit of getting rid of Simple Choice plans is that customers will be forced to choose T-Mobile's more expensive plan. During the third quarter, when T-Mobile introduced its T-Mobile One plan, it saw a 2.2% sequential increase in average revenue per postpaid phone subscriber. And Carter points out the new service plan was only available for one month that quarter. While including taxes and fees in its new pricing seems like it could be a price cut, T-Mobile has also done away with its $5 per-line autopay discount. Effectively, it's replacing one pricing promotion with another. As a result, the new All In promotion shouldn't impact average revenue per user (ARPU) on T-Mobile One accounts very much. T-Mobile currently has the lowest ARPU in the industry for postpaid phone subscribers, as seen in the table below. Wireless Carrier Postpaid Phone ARPU Q3 2016 AT&T $59.64 Sprint $58.03 Verizon $47.52* T-Mobile $48.15 *Includes lower-value connections like tablets and IoT devices.Source: Company earnings reports. There's clearly room for T-Mobile to increase its ARPU, but it's also been able to put pressure on its competitors' ARPU. The result is a growing T-Mobile customer base that's also paying more per month, on average. T-Mobile dramatically improved its network coverage in 2016, but its retail footprint hasn't quite caught up with its network. Carter says the company plans to open 1,000 new T-Mobile stores by mid-2017. Since T-Mobile's marketing campaigns are all done on a nationwide scale, it already has strong brand recognition in those areas, which generally have lower competition. Carter estimates the additional stores will reach 30 million to 40 million potential customers, which could add meaningful growth to its subscriber base. When it comes to grabbing share of the enterprise market, Verizon and AT&T are dominant forces. Carter says, ""We still index very low on B2B [business to business]."" T-Mobile has taken less than 5% of the marketplace. AT&T counts 50 million postpaid connections in its Business Solutions segment. In fact, AT&T's business customers outnumber its retail wireless customers. While business customers are harder to convert than retail customers due to the need to convert so many people at once, T-Mobile is much better positioned to win these valuable contracts than just two years ago. It may be a slow process, but investors should look for enterprise customers to add meaningfully to service revenue in 2017 and beyond. Overall, T-Mobile is poised for another strong year of service-revenue growth as its competitors struggle to tread water. ","

Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","

Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. ","

934,Daniel B. Kline,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A new report (link open PDF) released by the National Economic Council (NEC), a board created in 1993 to advise the president on domestic and global economic policy, shows that declining competition in some markets has led to rising pricing in the form of hidden fees for American consumers. The NEC noted that competition not only keeps prices down, it also forces companies to innovate and can push wages higher. In its December report, though, the agency found several indicators of declining competition in the United States. These include ""increasing levels of industry concentration, increasing returns to capital accruing to a few firms, lower levels of firm entry, and decreased labor market mobility."" It's a situation where more money has become concentrated in the biggest companies. That creates a market where consumers often pay the price. In many situations, according to NEC, this involves ""hidden"" or ""muddy"" prices, situations where the advertised cost does not equal what a person actually pays. Image source: Getty Images. A hidden fee is not an add-on for an extra service, but a mandatory charge that people must pay in order to use whatever they are buying. For example, both AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) charge ""line access fees"" on top of their advertised prices. Since consumers can't use their phones or data plans without paying this fee, it's not really an extra charge, but part of the basic price. ""In many industries, businesses use so-called 'hidden fees' -- the addition of a mandatory or quasi-mandatory fee to the advertised price of a good or service ... to effectively raise the final price,"" NEC wrote. ""At their worst, such fees can be fraudulent or deceptive; at a minimum, they make prices unclear, hinder effective consumer decision making, and dull the competitive process."" The NEC report listed a number of hidden fees that consumers routinely pay. In some cases, like the AT&T and Verizon example above, these fees have become so ingrained in various industries that people no longer even question them. The worst offenders, according to the report, include: Not appearing in the report is the cable and broadband industries, where most major players add ""broadcast fees,"" and ""sports fees"" to their advertised prices and on the internet side charge rental fees for needed equipment. In all these cases, what's consistent is that consumers have no choice but to pay a cost that's more than what they expected based on advertised prices. In addition to potential regulatory solutions, and new competition forcing companies to abandon deceptive pricing, the NEC said that customers can force an end to these practices. ""Consumers and consumer groups play a crucial role in moderating fees,"" according to the report. ""For example, in event ticketing, even absent regulation, consumer outrage at fees has been acknowledged by some vendors who, in turn, have made some effort to clarify why they charge the fees they do."" Of course, the easiest way to end these practices would be to outlaw them. One method of doing that would be to legally require ""all-in"" pricing. There are various versions of this legislation, but in a broad sense the laws would require companies to advertise pricing that reflects exactly what a person will pay. It's easy to see why consumers would want this and some companies would not. Forcing businesses to disclose the final ""all-in"" price may not lower prices, but it would at least allow for a level playing field and a more informed buying public. ","

935,Mark Hulbert,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 17, 2017 10:20 a.m. ET Low-volatility shares, such as the six listed here, beat the broader market in the long run By CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The two-plus months since Donald Trump’s election has been exciting for stock market investors. Still, they need to be reminded that boredom has its virtues too. That’s because excitement works both ways: The stocks that perform best when the market is rising tend to fall the most when the market heads south. We tend to forget that after the market has mounted an impressive rally. So, with anxiety about the Trump rally stalling, now is an especially good time to remember that low-volatility stocks are the opposite of exciting: Though they lag behind during rallies, they usually beat the market when it’s falling. They therefore hold their own over an entire market cycle, if not come out well ahead. A column on this subject would not have been necessary as recently as this past summer and fall. That’s because low-volatility approaches at that time were riding a crest of popularity; exchange traded funds that employ such approaches were amassing huge sums. No fewer than six such ETFs, for example, each had over $2 billion in assets under management. The period since the election in early November has taken some of the wind out of those ETFs’ sails.

Read: How I lost money in the Trump rally Yet this market-lagging performance is precisely what history teaches us would happen, as you can see from the accompanying chart. On average during the last three bull markets (as identified by Ned Davis Research), the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has risen 58.9% versus 71.8% for the S&P 500. It’s during bear markets, of course, that low-volatility approaches tend to shine. On average during the past three bear markets, the S&P Low Volatility Index has fallen 15.2%, compared with 29.5% for the S&P 500. Due to the magic of compounding, these smaller losses more than make up for the market-trailing returns during bull markets. Over the past decade, for example, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has beaten the S&P 500 by an annualized margin of 8.5% to 7% (on a dividend-adjusted basis). Beating the market by 1.5 percentage points a year would be reason enough to consider such stocks. But there’s an added bonus as well: They’re also less volatile. That’s very much a winning combination. To pursue a low-volatility stock strategy, however, you must be willing to give up the potential for some upside excitement. With the market at all-time highs, that’s something you should seriously consider. Think of it this way: A low-volatile-stock strategy, in effect, allows you to take some chips off the table without giving up on the stock market as a whole. Probably the easiest way to pursue such a strategy is via an ETF, since it’s important to be well-diversified.

The change comes after a successful 2016, a year in which value stocks have beaten growth, particularly after the election. Here’s how his “Gradient 50” strategy of 50 stocks has performed, according to information verified by Orion Advisor Services: In this table, “total return” for the “Gradient 50” strategy includes cash dividends, while total returns for the index include the reinvestment of dividends. Binger said his firm’s clients tend to be at or near retirement age, so many take their dividends in cash to generate income. As cash from dividends builds up in the fund, it is reinvested in stocks, just not automatically in the same ones that are paying the dividends. Gradient Investments is a registered investment adviser based in Arden Hills, Minn., with about $1.3 billion in assets under management for affiliated advisers. The Gradient 50 strategy, one of several strategies Binger and his colleagues pursue, seeks to outperform the benchmark S&P 500

                                   by selecting stocks of what they consider “high quality” U.S. companies, and where dividend yields exceed that of the index. They will sell stocks that have become expensive relative to earnings or cash flow and seek opportunities to buy shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor with the market. The aggregate dividend yield for the S&P 500 is 2.07%, according to FactSet. Gradient generally selects stocks with yields of at least 2.5% for the Gradient 50 strategy, and the portfolio’s dividend yield now is roughly 3.5%. The 50 stocks held within that portfolio are rebalanced each quarter, so each stock tends to amount to about 2% of the assets. This chart shows how high the S&P 500 is trading relative to the past 12 months’ earnings. By this measure, the index hasn’t traded this high since January 2004: Asked if there were alarming signs for stock valuations, Binger replied: “Sure there are. At the current time, I would say the dividend-paying group, as a whole, is subjectively overvalued. If I have a group of 50 dividend paying stocks and the portfolio was up 20% while the market was up 12% [in 2016], what does that tell you?” This is why Binger said it was a “pefect time” for his firm to roll out a new strategy, which it calls the “Gradient 40 International.” The portfolio includes 40 stocks, and Binger said each “needs to be a blue-chip company domiciled outside the U.S.” They also need to be publicly traded in the U.S., or have American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) traded on U.S. exchanges. Rather than shifting the holdings of the domestic G50 strategy, Binger said his firm was suggesting that affiliated advisers with clients worried about U.S. stock valuations reduce exposure to the G50 and consider investing in the G40-I, because he believes “global markets are a little bit cheaper than their U.S. counterparts. Binger named 10 stocks held in the new G40-I portfolio. Here they are, sorted by dividend yield: When MarketWatch spoke with Binger in May, he had just sold the G50’s holdings of AT&T Inc.

According to FactSet, the company’s free cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $689 million, while dividends on common shares totaled $264 million. That’s a dividend payout ratio of just 38%. “This makes me feel comfortable that the [4.85%] dividend yield isn’t in any danger at all,” Binger said.

937,Philip van Doorn,1192017,MarketWatch,1122017,"Published: Jan 16, 2017 8:50 a.m. ET A deep dive yields generous income-producing stocks coupled with some downside protection By Income-hungry investors continue to flock to stocks over bonds, where yields, while rising, remain relatively low. But how to find attractive investments? Last year’s “flight to yield” pushed many stock valuations to relatively high levels, making some dividend stocks appear to be risky short-term investments. For long-term growth investors, there are plenty of solid arguments against dividend stocks, including these from Meb Faber. But dividend stocks still appeal to investors who need income now and to those who think it’s only fair for companies to reward their owners with a good portion of the profits. And if a high dividend-payer’s sales and profits are also increasing, so much the better. Meanwhile, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds range from 75 to 150 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasury notes

This left us with 164 stocks. We then excluded any stock trading above the aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio (based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates) for its sector or for the entire S&P 1500, whichever was lower. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and its 11 sectors: That last cut left us with 50 stocks. Here are the 20 with the highest dividend yields, as of the market close on Jan. 9: This group of dividend stocks is certainly not universally loved by Wall Street analysts, as the following summary shows. Then again, the analysts’ ratings are built on one-year price targets, rather than current income and the hope of long-term capital growth to sweeten the pot. Note that while only three of these stocks have “buy” ratings from 50% of the analysts and just one does better than that, only three are expected by analysts to show price declines over the next 12 months. Those expected price decline, however, are small, and shareholders are being paid to wait through the dividends. No method of screening stocks can save you from doing the important research that will help you form an opinion about a company’s likelihood of long-term success with its business strategy. So that’s your next step, hopefully with the help of your broker or investment adviser, if you seen any names you like here.

                                    SPX, -0.15% It may seem strange to look ahead to 2018 so early in 2017, but it makes sense for long-term investors because some themes can take a long time to play out. Banks, for example, are expected to become much more profitable as interest rates rise, because rates on their loan portfolios will increase faster than their funding costs. So long-term investors — those making commitments of at least three years — really do need to take a longer-range look at earnings expectations. Don’t miss: Twitter must change course, and this tech executive has some tips The method Beginning with the S&P 500, we isolated companies with forward price-to-earnings ratios for 2018 that were lower than the aggregate P/E ratio for their sector or for the entire index, which ever was lower. The P/E ratios were rounded to the nearest tenth. A positive P/E ratio assumes that a company will be profitable in 2018. Here are the forward P/E ratios for the index and all of its sectors, except the new real estate sector, which S&P Dow Jones Indices carved out of the financial sector in September, and for which an aggregate price-to-earnings ratio isn’t yet available: The energy sector was trading highest to consensus 2018 earnings estimates at the market close Jan.6. This reflects expectations that oil prices will at least remain stable, and analysts’ expectations that 2018 earnings will still be relatively low. But we’ve made a rather severe cut, only listing energy companies that trade at a discount to the entire S&P 500. We then excluded any company whose revenue is not expected by analysts to increase in 2018 from 2017. Also see: If you bought the Trump rumor, now it’s time to sell the news Here are the three remaining companies in each sector expected to post the greatest increase in earnings per share in 2018, except for the telecommunications sector, which is quite small to begin with, and for which only one company made the cut: Long-term bargains often begin with low price-to-earnings ratios and high rates of expected EPS growth. But you must consider why those companies may be deemed undervalued by other investors. If you see any names of interest here, do your own research, hopefully with the assistance of a broker or financial adviser. Put simply: You need to form an opinion about how likely a company is to succeed with its business strategy over the next five years at least.

The 2,277 resistance matches the December peak and the S&P’s all-time closing high, established Jan. 6. Conversely, the 2,263 area matches a near-term floor, and is followed by firmer support around 2,252. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. Notable resistance matches the range top, technically spanning from 19,987 to 19,999. The Dow’s record close rests slightly lower, at 19,974.62. Separately, consider that last week’s close of 19,885 matched a near-term inflection point. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains stronger. The index has rallied to yet another all-time high, punctuating a successful test of support, better illustrated below. From current levels, the 5,464 breakout point pivots to first support. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended the January rally, rising last week from a successful test of the breakout point. Notable support broadly spans from 5,487 to the December peak of 5,512, an area closely matching the ascending 20-day moving average. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark has virtually flatlined just under record territory. Consider that last week’s low of 19,770 held just eight points above the 2016 close. This area remains an inflection point, matching support more broadly spanning from 19,718 to 19,770. Separately, the Dow’s tight five-week range is a continuation pattern, currently capped by the 20,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained first support — the 2,252 area — bottoming last week at 2,254. More broadly, the S&P’s recent backdrop resembles the late-July/August post-Brexit price action. Its formerly overbought posture is working off via time, rather than price. (The S&P has flatlined, without pulling in materially.) As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks’ strong bull trend is intact. The Nasdaq Composite has notched another all-time high — confirming its uptrend — while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials remain range-bound, but firmly within view of record territory. In fact, the S&P mised an all-time closing high last week by less than three points. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is acting well technically. As illustrated, it’s maintained support matching the 2016 close (134.85), surviving a strong-volume retest last week. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that the MDY has maintained a posture firmly atop first support, closing last week within striking distance of record territory. Resistance technically spans from 309.09 to 309.59.

The successful retest, amid the orderly January range, is technically constructive. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has maintained first support at 2,252, bottoming last week two points higher. The rally from support marked a bullish single-day reversal, and was punctuated by last week’s close, missing a record by less than three points. From current levels, the S&P’s all-time closing high rests at 2,276.98 — and remains within view — while the absolute record peak holds at 2,282.10. Both levels were established Jan. 6. The S&P 500’s persistence near the range top signals muted selling pressure, improving the chances of an eventual leg higher. More broadly, significant support spans from 2,190 to 2,214, an area matching the 50-day moving average, currently 2,222. The S&P’s intermediate-term backdrop supports a bullish view barring a violation.

                                   remains well positioned. Technically, the shares continue to challenge two inflection points. With Tuesday’s strong start, the shares have gapped atop the breakdown point — the 115 area — though, as always, it’s the close that matters. A close higher would neutralize the November breakdown, more firmly signaling a trend shift. Meanwhile, the GLD’s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered another six-month high, improving the chances of incremental follow-through. Tactically, the 50-day offers an area from which to work, and a rally attempt is in play barring a violation. An intermediate-term target matches trendline resistance, and the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Conversely, the U.S. dollar — also detailed last week — has extended its downturn amid gold’s resurgence, and a related safe-haven trade.

940,,2092017,Reuters,2022017,"The Appellate Division, First Department in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in rejecting a class-action settlement requiring Verizon to disclose more information to shareholders who thought it overpaid, and get a “fairness opinion” if it sold some of the venture’s assets. It also entitled the shareholders’ lawyers to up to $2 million for fees and expenses. “Disclosure-only” settlements have lost favor in recent years, with critics saying they provide little benefit to shareholders and companies, while forcing companies to pay fees of shareholders’ lawyers in a so-called “merger tax.” Judges in Delaware courts routinely approved such settlements for many years but have in recent decisions made clear those days are over, causing lawyers to file dozens of merger-related lawsuits in other courts instead. The Verizon settlement drew objections from two shareholders, and was rejected in December 2014 by New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer. He said the accord failed to materially boost shareholder knowledge about the merger, which had closed in February 2014, and could impede the New York-based phone company’s ability to sell assets. But in Thursday’s decision, a four-judge appellate division panel said the added disclosures provided at least “some benefit” to shareholders, while the fairness opinion requirement could help insure good prices for asset sales. The panel also tightened its nearly 27-year-old test for approving such settlements, adding requirements that they be in shareholders’ and companies’ best interests. It said the Verizon settlement achieved both. “Given the changing circumstances and concerns surrounding nonmonetary settlements of class actions,” the Verizon case offered an opportunity “to address present day concerns,” Justice Marcy Kahn wrote. The appellate division returned the case to the lower court to determine legal fees. “We are pleased,” Juan Monteverde, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email. “Litigation that provides enhanced corporate disclosures and corporate governance will continue to play a vital role in protecting public shareholders.” A lawyer for one of the objecting shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The other objector, Gerald Walpin, a former inspector general under President George W. Bush, died last year. The case is Gordon et al v. Verizon Communications Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1st Department, No. 653084/2013. ","

941,,2092017,Reuters,2022017,"Under the Obama administration, the Federal Communications Commission had sent letters raising concerns about whether some data practices by AT&T and Verizon violated net neutrality rules. The FCC had also sent letters to Comcast about its “Stream TV” service and to T-Mobile about its “Binge On” service in 2015. Millions of mobile phone users benefit from free data video services but critics warn that the practice may prod users into avoiding competitors’ services. Net neutrality rules imposed by the FCC in 2015 require broadband providers to treat all data equally and bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Tom Wheeler, who was FCC chairman until Jan. 20, told Reuters last month that its investigation found some free data practices were abusive and anticompetitive. But in an about-face on Friday, the regulator now under Republican control said it was closing its investigation. “These free-data plans have proven to be popular among consumers, particularly low-income Americans, and have enhanced competition in the wireless marketplace,” new FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. Sponsored or zero-rated free data programs allow mobile phone users free data if they use certain video services. AT&T phone subscribers can watch DirecTV, which is owned by the company, on their phones without incurring data charges. Verizon also offers mobile phone subscribers some sponsored “go90” video content that does not count against data caps. In a Jan. 11 report, the FCC’s wireless bureau said Binge On did not violate net neutrality rules, but it found concerns with AT&T and Verizon’s data programs. Pai voted against the net neutrality rules and said last month he thought the regulation’s “days are numbered.” “It is clear that net neutrality is public enemy number one for Chairman Pai,” Democratic U.S. Senator Edward Markey said on Friday. “He is starting his campaign by protecting harmful zero-rating plans.” Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company has always believed its free data programs benefit customers. Joan Marsh, an AT&T’s senior vice president said the decision was a “win for the millions of consumers who are reaping the benefits of services made available through free data programs.” Comcast declined to comment, but has said its “Stream TV” is an IP-based cable service that is not covered by net neutrality rules.

942,,2092017,Reuters,2022017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Vector Capital said on Wednesday it raised a $1.4 billion private equity fund, giving the U.S. buyout firm more firepower to pursue acquisitions in the technology sector as it faces increasing competition from rival investment firms. The new fund comes as Vector vies for deals against bigger technology-focused private equity firms such as Vista Equity Partners Management LLC and Thoma Bravo LLC, while also competing with smaller peers such as Francisco Partners, Marlin Equity Partners and Siris Capital Group LLC. Vector’s fifth fund was oversubscribed by $200 million, and is the largest to date for the San Francisco-based firm, which was spun off from Ziff Brothers Investments in 1997. Vector’s previous fund, Vector Capital IV, was raised in 2007 and amassed $1.2 billon. It had a net internal rate of return of 14.4 percent and delivered a multiple on investment of 1.7 times as of the end of June, according to the most recent data available from one of its investors, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). By comparison, CalPERS’ private equity program delivered a net internal rate of return of 10.6 percent since inception to the end of June. Alex Slusky, Vector’s founder and chief investment officer, said that Vector differentiates itself by investing in turnarounds that other buyout firms avoid. “We focus on more complex projects that other private equity firms will not undertake,” Slusky said. “Investing in a contrarian manner gives us the opportunity to buy companies well below their intrinsic value.” Last month, Vector lobbed a non-binding joint bid with private equity firm Clearlake Capital Group for Tangoe Inc TNGO.O, an expense management firm company with a market capitalization of $265 million that is facing delisting from the Nasdaq over accounting issues. With its new fund, Vector will look to invest between $75 million to $150 million of equity in each deal, a slightly larger amount than its last fund. It may also invest through its smaller credit business. Vector will target companies valued between $100 million and $2 billion, including debt, in North America, Europe and Israel. Vector still has some capital to invest from its last fund before it starts deploying its new fund, Slusky said. ","

943,Donna Fuscaldo,2092017,Investopedia,2022017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Charter Communications (CHTR) is reportedly tacking on what is seen as a controversial fee to the new subscribers it acquired when it bought Time Warner Cable and Bright House Media, according to a new analysis by Motley Fool. The fee, known as the “Broadcast TV Fee” can be anywhere from $3 to $6 a month and, according to Motley Fool, cable operators pass on the fees they have to pay local channels to rebroadcast their signals. Customers of both Charter and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) can’t waive or decline the fee even if they get rid of local channels, noted the report. Charter has started passing that fee on to new customers it acquired via the two cable system buys, with some customers in Massachusetts receiving notices that they have to pay the broadcast fee. MassLive.com reported customers were informed they would have to pay a $4.47 a month local broadcast TV surcharge starting in February. For Charter, news of new fees isn’t likely to sit well with consumers who are increasingly balking at increased fees and are looking for ways to cut the cord from their set-top boxes and satellite dishes. It doesn’t help that Charter and Comcast are among the most hated companies in America, according to 24/7 Wall St.’s annual rankings. Holding the rank of 12th-most hated company in America, 24/7 Wall Street said Charter scored below average in customer service for both the fixed-line telephone industry and the internet provider market, owning one of the poorest customer-service reputations in the subscription-television service industry. It doesn’t help that Comcast acquired Time Warner Cable, another outfit with a bad customer-service reputation, adding to its woes. (See also: Comcast, Sprint, DISH, Charter on Most-Hated List.) Meanwhile, in December the Consumer Federal of America came out with a scathing report in which it argued that Charter, Comcast, AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) operate as a “tight oligopoly on steroids,” in which they can get away with overcharging customers to the tune of $60 billion per year. Mark Cooper, CFA’s director of research and the author of the report, said a typical household with two wireless subscriptions, a landline, broadband service and multichannel video, will face a total overcharge of about $45 per month, or $540 per year. All together, the overcharges come to almost $60 billion per year, he said. ",Charter Passing on Broadcast Fee to New Customers | Investopedia,-0.9484

(CMCSA) may be a darling of Wall Street, with the consensus rating standing at buy, but Morningstar thinks investors should hold off. While Morningstar, which has a two-star rating on the nation’s top cable operator, applauded Comcast’s ability to offer multiple services over one connection and said Comcast continues to steal market share from the likes of phone companies, all of that good news is priced into the stock, with analyst Neil Macker calling shares overvalued. Since the start of the year, shares of Comcast have gained close to 8%, and it’s up more than 36% from its 52-week low of $54.70. Recently, shares were inching down 0.04% or $0.03 to $74.83. Morningstar did note that Comcast remains well positioned competitively but that the cable business isn’t expected to see rapid growth, an assessment that hurt the stock. Although shares of Comcast have been climbing over the past few months, there are competitive threats coming from the likes of AT&T Inc. (T) and DISH Networks Corp. (DISH) with their over-the-top streaming video services. AT&T’s DirecTV Now already has more than 200,000 customers, and DISH’s Sling TV has been a revenue booster for the satellite provider. Comcast is getting in to the over-the-top market but has yet to roll out a service. It has announced it’s getting into the wireless market and recently inked deals with Netflix and Roku to remain competitive at a time when consumers are increasingly cutting the cord on their cable boxes and satellite dishes. Earlier this month Comcast announced the Xfinity TV app for Roku, which gives Xfinity TV customers access to all of their Comcast content on Roku devices. In a blog post announcing the beta test, Comcast said the Xfinity TV beta app enables customers to use the beta Roku channel while Comcast continues to test and improve its performance. Comcast said initially the Xfinity TV beta app will be available on Roku TV models and all Roku players released in the last couple of years. (See also: Comcast Releases Beta of Xfinity TV App for Roku.) At the same time that Comcast is seeing increased competition from alternative services, it does have an ally on the regulatory front. President Donald Trump has put in place a lot of M&A-friendly people to run some federal regulatory bodies, including the Federal Communications Commission. Ajit Pai, the new FCC chairman, is a staunch critic of net neutrality and recently held back from taking action against AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) for not counting customer’s data allotment when streaming their own content under a practice called sponsored data. Former FCC chief Tom Wheeler had slammed both telecom companies for the practice, which he alleged violated net neutrality. ",Morningstar: Comcast Overvalued at Current Levels | Investopedia,0.9815

Executives within Disney are betting that Iger, who has run the company for 12 years and turns 66 on Friday, will have to stick around longer, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. By all accounts, Iger is a worthy boss. Since he took over in 2005, Disney's market value rose from $46 billion to about $148 billion at the end of its fiscal 2016 year.

Image source: Getty Images. Though cash is king in business and investing, successful publicly traded companies also tend to be highly profitable on an accounting basis as well. Where there's one, you often find the other. Here's a quick overview of two large-cap stocks that are set to see their profits rise meaningfully in the year ahead: Company Name Market Capitalization Estimated Annual EPS Growth The Kraft Heinz Company $106.9 billion 50.6% T-Mobile US $49.4 billion 64.1% Data source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. Of course, profit growth is only one facet of the investment narrative for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). To get a better sense of whether these names deserve further research on your part, let's examine each company in greater detail. The future looks bright, in 2017 and beyond, for the $137 billion love child resulting from the 2015 merger of consumer-staples giants Kraft and Heinz. The company figures to be an earnings growth powerhouse in the years to come, as it continues to realize its merger-related synergies. In fact, the company reaffirmed its plans to shave $1.5 billion in costs from its business model  by the end of 2017, according to its most recent earnings release. This kind behavior is typical of the culture at the new Kraft Heinz, in which Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital both own large minority stakes. A favorite saying of 3G co-founder and billionaire  Carlos Sicupira is that ""costs are like fingernails; you have to cut them constantly."" This dedication makes Kraft Heinz a safe bet to continue to compound its earnings growth and dividend payments over the long term. Management's dedication to continued cost savings should indeed come as a relief amid a tepid outlook for revenue growth. Sales are projected to decline 0.6% this year and only increase a mere 1.6% next year. In terms of its valuation, the company trades at 22.7 times its consensus 2017 earnings estimates. Taking into account its 2.7% dividend, its focus on long-term earnings growth, and its reasonable valuation, Kraft Heinz presents an intriguing opportunity for investors in the consumer-staples space today. The fastest-growing company among major U.S. telecoms, T-Mobile has kept proving doubters wrong in recent years. Branding itself as the customer-centric foil to larger incumbents AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), T-Mobile has gained market share in 14 consecutive quarters and delivered some impressive earnings growth in the process. Thanks to its continued execution, T-Mobile's revenue increased 18%, net income rose 165%, and earnings per share climbed 180% in its most recent quarter.  More encouraging still, the company appears poised to build off this momentum in the year ahead. The average of sell-side analysts currently rates T-Mobile stock as a buy, calling for sales to expand 15.1% in 2017 and a further 9.4% in 2018. Despite all its successes, though, it's important to note that T-Mobile and Sprint face important size disadvantages against their better-heeled rivals. AT&T and Verizon enjoy customer bases roughly twice the size of T-Mobile and Sprint. The annuity-like nature of the telecom market allows AT&T and Verizon to generate significantly higher cash flows, which in turn enables them to more easily invest in future growth initiatives. For example, Verizon has spent nearly $10 billion to acquire mobile content and advertising businesses in AOL and Yahoo! What's more, recent rumors of a discussed merger with Charter Communications implies that Verizon might continue to aggressively engage in M&A to shore up its future competitive positioning. AT&T has already done just that by agreeing to buy Time Warner, which should help the company lead the continuing shift in content consumption flowing through mobile devices. Competing against these offerings will be a tall order for T-Mobile. However, the company has repeatedly proved itself to be the most entrepreneurial player in the U.S. telecom market, which is arguably entering an entirely new era -- one in which it isn't clear whether T-Mobile will be able to as easily fuel its growth by prying away customers from AT&T and Verizon in the medium term. As its sizable earnings growth this year signals, though, betting against T-Mobile tends to be a losing proposition as well. ","
      
    2 Stocks Projected to Grow Profits the Most in 2017 -- The Motley Fool

950,Brian Feroldi,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Every investor dreams of getting in on the next great growth stock. However, it can be quite difficult to invest in companies that promise extreme growth rates because they are often bid up to premium valuations that can make them quite risky to own. Still, fast growth can often flame out. Regardless, it can be worthwhile to build a watchlist of potential multi-baggers. To help you do just that, I ran a screen to identify companies with the following characteristics: Of the companies identified by the screen, three stood out to me as poised for exceptional growth: Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM). Are any of them worth buying today? Read on to learn more about these companies so you can make that call for yourself. Image source: Getty Images. Payroll is a boring but mission-critical task for every business. The market for this service is mature and extremely competitive, but Paycom Software has been rapidly rising up in this industry since its founding in 1998. What makes Paycom's product offering stand apart from more established competitors? First, Paycom's platform is provided exclusively through the cloud. That makes it easy to implement and access from anywhere. Second, Paycom offers far more than just simple payroll processing solutions. The company's platform is an all-in-one human capital management software solution that assists with many other HR tasks such as time management, performance reviews, recruiting, training, and more. This unique combination is helping Paycom grow like wildfire. Revenue has grown by more than 40% annually over the past five years, which has allowed the company's bottom line to swell. Better yet, 98% of the company's revenue is recurring, which gives the company a predictable base to grow from. Image source: Getty Images. The only knock against Paycom is that Wall Street is aware of the company's potential and has priced its stock accordingly. Trading for nearly 65 times trailing earnings, Paycom stock is far from cheap, so if the company's growth engine stalls, shareholders could be in for a world of pain. Still, fast-growing stocks that are already profitable don't come along every day, so I think this is one growth stock worth paying up to own. The U.S. wireless market is mature and dominated by AT&T and Verizon, so you'd be forgiven for assuming that there isn't any room for anyone else to grow. I thought so, too, which is why I was surprised to learn that T-Mobile showed up on my screen. If you live in the U.S., then you are likely familiar with T-Mobile's ""Un-carrier"" messaging. The company has been calling out other wireless carriers for using hidden fees and charges to jack up their customers' bills. By contrast, T-Mobile promises customers great service, unlimited access to data, and transparent pricing terms that are free of hidden costs. Image source: T-Mobile. This simple messaging is clearly resonating with consumers -- T-Mobile has been steadily taking market share away from incumbent carriers for years. In fact, the company has gained over 1 million customers each quarter for more than three years running. Looking ahead, T-Mobile has announced plans to expand its footprint by opening 1,000 new stores and making a bigger push into the business market. CEO John Legere is so confident that these moves will drive new customer growth that he recently made the bold statement that he expects to overtake AT&T in total phone customers in five years' time. If that prediction comes true, T-Mobile's investors look poised to reap substantial rewards from here. Each year, Americans spend more than $176 billion treating diabetes, which is a chronic disease that affects more than 29 million Americans. Sadly, both of these figures continue to climb higher with each passing year. Diabetes is a burdensome disease that requires patients to measure their blood sugar by pricking their finger on a daily basis. To help ease this burden, Dexcom launched a small medical device that is worn on the body and constantly measures blood glucose levels. Not only is this device far more consumer-friendly than traditional glucose monitors, it also allows patients to track their blood sugar in real time. Patients and providers around the world have been flocking to Dexcom's solution for years, which has caused the company's revenue to soar: DXCM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Amazingly, these extreme growth rates have been achieved without reimbursement access from Medicare. Thankfully, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced that it was changing its policy and will begin offering coverage for Dexcom's G5 Mobile system. That's big news that promises to open up a massive new group of patients to Dexcom's system. Like Paycom, the markets have caught on to Dexcom's growth potential and have awarded it a crazy valuation. Still, diabetes isn't going away anytime soon, and Dexcom looks well-positioned for fast growth ahead. Time could prove that paying up to own this company's stock is well worth it. ","

951,"Matthew Frankel, CFP",2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's no big secret that dividend-paying stocks tend to do better over the long run than their non-dividend counterparts, and also tend to perform better during tough economic times. If you're not comfortable picking individual stocks, as many investors aren't, there are some great ETFs available that can make dividend stocks a part of your portfolio. Two of the biggest dividend stock ETFs are the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM) and the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:SDY). Here's a little about each, and which could be the best buy for you. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which includes 412 stocks that pay higher-than-average dividend yields, specifically excluding REITs. The fund's current dividend yield is 2.9% as of this writing, and here's a look at its 10 largest holdings: Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets Microsoft 2.45% 5.1% ExxonMobil 3.59% 4.1% Johnson & Johnson 2.82% 3.5% JPMorgan Chase 2.20% 3.4% General Electric 3.23% 3.1% Wells Fargo 2.65% 3% AT&T 4.75% 2.9% Procter & Gamble 3.06% 2.5% Chevron 3.80% 2.4% Verizon 4.76% 2.4% Source: Vanguard. Dividend yields are current as of 2/6/17. The fund has $24.3 billion of total assets, and charges a rock-bottom 0.09% expense ratio. Over the past 10 years, the annualized average total return of the fund is 7.14%. Image Source: Getty Images. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF seeks to track the performance of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of the highest-yielding stocks on the S&P Composite 1500 index that have increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. The fund holds just 112 stocks, just over one-fourth of the Vanguard fund, and pays a 3.2% dividend yield as of this writing, but interestingly, the holdings are more spread out. If you look at the chart of the fund's top 10 holdings, you'll notice that no single stock makes up more than 1.9% of the total assets. Company Dividend Yield % of Fund's Assets AT&T 4.75% 1.9% Old Republic International 3.57% 1.7% Realty Income 4.22% 1.7% AbbVie 4.22% 1.7% National Retail Properties 4.23% 1.6% Consolidated Edison 3.72% 1.5% Chevron 3.80% 1.5% People's United Financial 3.60% 1.4% Emerson Electric 3.22% 1.4% IBM 3.19% 1.4% Source: SPDR. Dividend yields are current as of 2/6/17. You'll also notice that while there is some overlap (AT&T and Chevron) between the funds' largest holdings, they are not as similar in composition as you may think. These are two funds with a similar objective (higher-than-average dividends) that take significantly different approaches to achieve it. As far as expenses go, the SPDR fund charges a 0.35% expense ratio, and has just over $15 billion in assets as of this writing. Over the past 10 years, the SPDR fund's annualized average total return has been 7.74%. To recap, here are some of the major differences between these two ETFs that investors should be aware of: Although the Vanguard ETF has a lower expense ratio, I prefer the SPDR because of the differences listed above. I'm a big fan of REITs for long-term dividend growth, I like the SPDR fund's lower reliance on its top holdings, and the fact that every single one of the SPDR fund's stocks have increased their dividend for at least 20 years in a row gives me confidence that the income generated by the fund will continue to grow.
