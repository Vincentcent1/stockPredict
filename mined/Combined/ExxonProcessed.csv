0,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The West’s three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbors. Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years. The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM] Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk. “There is only one policy here – you have to behave like a commercial corporation,” the executive told Reuters. “You have to make your choices purely economically and be Qatari in Qatar, Emirati in the Emirates.” Energy sales have powered Qatar’s rapid rise as a regional  player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors’ interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbors. Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks. Qatar, the world’s largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher. The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha’s response to their grievances had been negative. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said. Doha denies aiding terrorism and its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused the four of “clear aggression” while adding that Qatar continued to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. [nL8N1JW27A] [nL8N1JW1Y1] Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible. Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing “cooperation” with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency. Industry sources close to the talks said that “the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest”. Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar’s LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year. Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie. Shell’s Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world’s largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019. Shell’s operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world’s largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio. The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world’s biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said. Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar’s North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4] Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company’s plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source. Qatar’s LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimizing existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as “debottlenecking”, according to a senior industry source. Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer. “Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there,” Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said. “Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals.” ","

1,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"HANOI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Vietnam has extended an Indian oil concession in the South China Sea and begun drilling in another area it disputes with China in moves that could heighten tensions over who owns what in the vital maritime region. The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing’s relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China’s energy supplies and trade passes. Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company’s managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters. Part of that block is in the U-shaped ‘nine-dash line’ which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for  more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims. A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential. “Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China’s interventions in the South China Sea,” the official said. Vietnam’s state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June. Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold. Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam’s state oil firm, Spain’s Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates. Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd., has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain’s Repsol SA, which also has rights to neighboring block 07/03, Odfjell said. Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China’s claims. Odfjell’s Eirik Knudsen, V‎ice President for Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, referred further queries to Repsol, which declined to comment. PetroVietnam made no comment. When asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone “carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over”. “We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation,” he told a briefing in Beijing. Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was canceled around the time the drilling began. The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade. Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion “Blue Whale” gas concession off central Vietnam. They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam’s evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam’s coastguard. Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said. “We know they are unhappy again, but we are resisting the pressure – it is a traditional part of our relations with Beijing,” one official said privately. “Other parts of the relationship remain strong.” Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea. Hanoi’s growing defense and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances. The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China’s expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia. India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam’s waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country. On the agenda are transfers of naval vessels and missiles under a $500 million defense credit line announced last year. Next week, the navies of India, the United States and Japan will hold their largest joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal. ","

2,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry’s vulnerability to cyber attacks. Since at least May, hackers used tainted “phishing” emails to “harvest credentials” so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims. “Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,” the report said. Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28. The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity. A virus dubbed “NotPetya” attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators. Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants. The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations. Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine. Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create “decoy documents” on topics of interest to their targets. In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim’s computers and travel across their networks.

3,,7062017,Reuters,6292017,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Investors are slowly starting to push companies to reduce their carbon footprint and help the world meet targets on limiting global warming that were agreed in the 2015 Paris climate talks. Energy firms have faced shareholder demands to do more to curb carbon emissions, while some pension funds are demanding more commitment to climate goals from firms they invest in. Yet progress has still been modest since the Paris deal agreed by almost 200 nations came into force in November last year, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. “Lots of investors are looking to align their investments with a 2 degrees world. It’s just at what pace they all get there,” said Fiona Reynolds, managing director at the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Advocates of the climate deal hope new impetus will come from Thursday’s document published by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a group set up by G20 nations. The task force’s document outlines a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, drawing support from more than 100 companies with $11 trillion of assets. It aims to help investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders understand how firms manage climate risk and guide companies on information they should provide to explain their climate strategy, ultimately helping ensure corporate laggards are held to account. “The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement,” said Philippe Desfossés, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP. Sweden’s largest national pension fund AP7 set a high benchmark in June when it named six companies it said had breached the Paris accord, and ditched them from its portfolio. Several energy firms have faced shareholder rebellions at annual general meetings over their stance on climate change. ExxonMobil XON.N has been accused of misleading investors by a U.S. prosecutor, allegations the U.S. firm has dismissed as “frivolous”. Many energy firms have been sharing more information on their climate strategies, and some mining companies are starting to follow suit, such as iron ore miner Vale VALE5.SA. In a Reuters survey, 13 leading public and corporate pension schemes in Europe, Asia and North America managing a total $1.1 trillion said they were committed to engaging firms on their climate strategy. Three of those funds said explicitly that divestment was an option if talks were unsatisfactory. However, some funds said the threat of divestment was not the best approach to encouraging firms to improve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. “We think engagement investment is about promoting companies to be involved with ESG through engagement,” said Hiroichi Yagi, an adviser to the pension fund of Japan’s Secom, a leading security firm. “If you just sell and stop investing in companies that are not mindful of climate change, then you are abandoning engagement there,” he said, adding that he was not aware of any Japanese pension funds advocating divestment as an option. To date, most divestments have tended to be from companies mining coal, the dirtiest energy source. Some large investors, such as Norway’s $960-billion sovereign wealth fund, have set limits on how much revenues can come from that source. The most active asset owners on climate change have tended to be big pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds - Norway’s and New Zealand’s have reduced exposure to fossil fuels. Such firms have more in-house analysts to assess investments. Smaller funds are making slower progress in pushing climate issues up the agenda in determining investment policy. A survey by consultants Mercer of 1,241 European pension schemes, half of which had less than 100 million euros ($114 million) in assets, showed just 5 percent considered the financial impact of climate change on their portfolios. However, that was up from 4 percent a year earlier. “It’s ironic that the pace of response to this enormous issue is best described as glacial, outside a small group of leading funds,” said Phil Edwards, Mercer’s Global Director of Strategic Research, calling for more “urgency” to be applied. Advocates of the Paris accord hope the TFCD’s framework document will particularly assist smaller firms. Britain’s Environment Agency Protection Fund, a founder member of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) that aims to help asset owners assess firms, said more than 3 trillion pounds  ($3.9 trillion) of assets were now being invested using the TPI’s guidelines. “We are aiming to be one of the first asset owners to do this to show our support for the TCFD and its pick up by other asset owners,” said Faith Ward, the scheme’s chief responsible investment officer. She said her fund planned to link its annual report to the TCFD framework. ","

(AAPL). According to Calcbench, a research firm that analyzes financial data from the SEC, Apple has averaged $107.1 million in share repurchases daily since initiating its stock buyback program in August 2012. In sum, this means that the company has purchased $142 billion worth of its own stock during that period. For context, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), which is the second biggest purchaser of its own stock, averaged $42.4 million of stock repurchases per day and spent a total of $55.88 billion for the initiative between 2012 and 2017. In its latest earnings report, Apple announced that it had spent $151 billion on stock repurchases since August 2012. Its pace of buybacks has accelerated since 2015, when it had purchased $80 billion worth of its own stock from shareholders. Apple also announced during its latest earnings call that it was planning to increase its share repurchase program to $210 billion from the year-ago level of $175 billion. (See also: Why Would a Company Buy Back Its Own Shares?) The Cupertino, California-based company's stock price has appreciated by 68% from 2012 to 2017, after adjusting for a stock split that occurred in 2014. Share repurchases increase the value of outstanding shares because the total number of shares available decreases even as their price remains the same. For example, Apple had 6.6 billion of its shares trading in the markets in 2013. As of this May, that number is down to 5.2 billion. According to some estimates, the decline in the number of shares has translated to a 21% bump in earnings per share for the company. (For more on Apple's history of stock splits, check out: If You Had Invested Right After Apple's IPO.) Much of Apple's share repurchase program is financed from its overseas cash pile. Of the company's $250 billion in cash, 90% is estimated to be parked abroad. In recent times, criticism has mounted against the company for failing to make acquisitions of innovative startups or invest in improving its innovation track record through the use of its cash. Critics have charged the company with ""financial engineering"" through stock buybacks to boost its bottom line, especially in the face of declining enthusiasm for its iconic iPhone.

Thanks to years of wild spending on land and new wells, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) vaulted up the leaderboard and became one of America's largest gas producers -- second only to ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). That rapid growth fueled an explosive rise in its stock price until oil and gas prices came crashing down, which knocked Chesapeake Energy to the brink of bankruptcy. However, by undertaking a score of strategic initiatives, the company has shored up its balance sheet, which now has it in the position to thrive at lower commodity prices. In fact, the company is planning to expand output by 5% to 15% annually through the end of the decade if prices cooperate. That outlook has investors growing bullish that Chesapeake Energy could fuel profits into their portfolios in the coming years. That said, as compelling as Chesapeake Energy's upside potential is, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) expect to grow at a much faster pace in the coming years. Even better, those companies can do so with less risk, which should cause Chesapeake Energy bulls to take notice. Image source: Getty Images. One of the reasons investors are bullish on Chesapeake Energy is that it holds significant acreage positions in many of the country's fastest growing shale plays. However, one of the hindrances holding the company back from developing those assets is the debt on its balance sheet. While the company has cut debt by $2.6 billion over the past year and a half, it still has $9.1 billion remaining, which is too much debt for a company of its size in the current market environment. That's why investors who like Chesapeake's exposure to several shale plays should love Devon Energy since it also holds significant positions in most of the top shale plays, including the STACK play of Oklahoma, which is one of Chesapeake's emerging growth engines. In fact, Devon Energy controls the largest acreage position in the STACK, which when combined with its Permian Basin position, should fuel 13% to 17% oil production growth this year, and 20% growth in 2018. Contrast that with Chesapeake Energy, which only expects to deliver 10% oil growth this year, and that's off a lower base. One of the reasons Devon Energy can grow at a faster pace in the current market environment is its top-tier balance sheet. In fact, Devon has only slightly more debt at $10.3 billion but produces twice as much oil and gas as Chesapeake does on a daily basis. Furthermore, the bulk of its production comes from higher-margin liquids, which gives it more cash flow to cover its debt. That combination of greater growth with less financial risk makes Devon worth a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. Those higher drilling returns should enable EQT Corp to grow at a faster pace without spending any more capital. According to the company's projections, it can increase production by a more than 20% compound rate through the end of the decade, which trounces Chesapeake's forecast. Furthermore, EQT can finance that growth while living within cash flow, enabling it to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet. That combination of robust returns-driving growth with less financial risk makes it a compelling option for risk-averse investors. After nearly collapsing under the weight of its debt last year, Chesapeake Energy has come roaring back, thanks to a significant improvement in its financial situation and growth prospects. That said, as compelling as Chesapeake Energy might be for investors, Devon Energy and EQT Corp offer faster growth with lower risk because of their stronger balance sheets. That's why investors who are bullish on Chesapeake should take a closer look at what these two energy stocks have to offer. ","

8,Tyler Crowe,7062017,Fool,6292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. This past quarter, BP (NYSE:BP) looked like it was on the precipice of something big. Not only were earnings starting to look better, but BP is about to enter a rather impressive growth phase as several major projects come on line. On the company's most recent conference call, BP CFO Brian Gilvary touched on this major growth phase and how it will impact the bottom line as well as the overall economics. And, of course, no BP discussion would be complete without some discussion of the Macondo oil spill and the ongoing costs. Here are several quotes from the company's most recent conference call that should help give you a better understanding of BP's mind-set headed into the rest of the year. Image source: Getty Images. BP has been waffling quite a bit lately on how it is planning for the future. Integrated majors typically use some future oil price as a means to develop budgets and value prospective finds. Less than a year ago, the company was looking to achieve a breakeven of $50-$55 per barrel of Brent crude. Then, last quarter, CEO Bod Dudley said that the corporation would be able to ""re-balance its financial framework"" at $60 a barrel. This past conference call, CFO Brian Gilvary added a few new numbers into the mix. As noted in February, based on our current planning assumptions, this is consistent with our organic cash balance point reducing steadily to around $35 to $40 per barrel over the period [2017-2021] with the recent portfolio additions adding even more resilience to the portfolio. If you are a little confused by all these numbers being thrown around, you aren't the only one. The difference here seems to be that, at present, an oil price of $50-$55 per barrel is enough to cover its current capital spending as well as its dividend payments. That $60 a barrel is sufficient to achieve both of these things as well as eliminate the scrip dividend and lower its total debt levels to the desired range of 20%-30% of the capital structure. Finally, that range of $35-$40 per barrel is what breakeven will be several years from now when many of its major capital projects have come on line and spending is lower. That last one is a little harder to believe, though, since the company will likely embark on new spending projects once those under construction come on stream. 2017 is slated to be a big year for BP's oil and gas production. By the end of the year, it expects to have seven major capital projects completed and producing. When asked what kind of impact that would have on the company's cash flow, Gilvary was pretty clear that it will lead to a significant bump in operational cash, and it will have an impact on breakeven prices. In terms of material cash flows, yes, it is in terms of the operating cash. It gets driven off the back of the seven major projects coming on stream this year. And so the way in which the year was always set up was that the operating cash flow would grow through the first, second, third, fourth quarter with the major piece coming through in the fourth quarter. And that's why by the time we get to the end of the year, you see our breakeven economics come down quite significantly. By material you should assume that number means bigger than $1 billion delta versus where we are in the first quarter by the time we get to the end of the year. It will probably be significantly above that. For a while now, one of the largest stains on BP's quarterly results has been its U.S. operations, notably its ventures into shale. It wasn't that long ago that the company internally spun off its Lower 48 operations into an independent business that runs within BP to better respond to the fast-paced nature of shale drilling. It hasn't worked out so well thus far. This past quarter, U.S. upstream operations only accounted for 12% of upstream earnings even though it was 30% of total production. When asked what the company's capital plans were for the U.S., here's what Gilvary had to say. In terms of U.S. onshore, we today have – I think we're now back up to about 12 rigs in the first quarter of 2017, versus 5 in the fourth quarter. You'll see that ramp-up as the team experiments within each of the basins. But we're now running 12 rigs. Cash breakeven on a full free cash basis has now come down almost half from the full year 2015 to where we are in the first quarter of 2017, down around $2.60 [per thousand cubic feet of gas] or that sort of level, in terms of cash breakeven. The thing that should be a little concerning here is that the company is still doing experimental drilling to determine the best path forward for shale. Compare that with ExxonMobil and Chevron, which both have plans to grow significantly in the Permian Basin over the next few years. Part of BP's slower response is that the company's shale assets are much more related to gas -- hence the breakeven results given in natural gas prices.  Still, BP is going to have to figure out how to turn these operations into higher rates of return, because they aren't getting it done today. At the top of the conference call, Gilvary said that BP's capital spending would likely be in the $15 billion to $16 billion range, which was the lower end of its initial projections. Those plans were contingent, of course, on oil prices in a certain range. When asked if there was room to cut spending or if this was about as low as it gets for the year, Gilvary said there was still some wiggle room. [W]e could take another $1 billion out if we had to at though – in that scenario. But all options are open to us at that point in terms of flexibility within the financial frame and what else we need to look at. But I think it's an unlikely scenario from where we are today. As you see demand grow, we expect crude stocks to come back into line. Actually, crude stocks will probably still be at the top end of their historic range by the end of this year. So I think something around $50, $55 a barrel seems a reasonable assumption on a point forward basis. If it drops below $50, we have further flexibility in terms of how we manage that. That last part is important because oil prices have dipped below that $50-a-barrel mark. Don't be surprised if we get a lower capital budget projection in the coming months. It seems that the Macondo well spill is the issue that just won't go away. While the company did settle with the U.S. government, which will involve annual payments for more than a decade, the company still has some outstanding claims from businesses that claimed the spill impacted their operations. These led to some large spill costs this year, but Gilvary noted that almost all claims have now been processed and that we can expect outlays related to the Macondo spill will decline soon. Of the 149,000 [claims], we're down to about 4,000, of which 3,000 are recycled claims that at one point have been rejected and have come back into the system through the process that's allowed. So I think we're down to less than 1,000 claims now in terms of closing that process out going forward – in terms of less than 1,000 claims that we haven't yet had line of sight of. So I think we're now finally into the tail around business economic loss claims. And in terms of Macondo – and therefore being able to quantify and price up what that looks like on a quarterly basis, we're much closer to now. Management expects that total costs for the Macondo in 2017 will be $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion depending on these claims. In 2018, costs will drop to $2 billion in 2019, and then down to $1 billion per year for several years starting in 2019. ","

9,,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in entering a judgment to enforce the $1.6 billion award, since reduced to about $188 million, announced in October 2014 by the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It agreed with Venezuela’s argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures. “Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure,” Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote. “Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote.” Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options. Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case arose from Venezuela’s seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry. Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA. According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela’s payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion. Tuesday’s decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. The appeals court also said Exxon’s petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA. The case is Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-707. ","

It did not name the companies it pushed but said the “majority” had boards of directors lacking women. “We’ve been particularly focused on increasing the number of women on U.S. boards because progress in the U.S. has been slower than in many other markets,” BlackRock said in a report it distributed. “Board diversity, particularly in terms of gender, is important from a sustainable investment perspective, given that diverse groups have been demonstrated to make better decisions,” it added. “This appears to be because they are better able to consider, where appropriate, alternatives to current strategies - a proposition that can ultimately lead to sustained value creation.” Women hold about a fifth of board seats in the S&P 500 .SPX index, according to Catalyst Inc, an advocacy group. BlackRock said it also voted against board members at five companies who sat on nominating committees but failed to respond to investors’ concerns about diversity. It was the first year the company “decided to vote against members of the nomination committee of men-only boards in a more systematic manner,” a spokesman said, although it had engaged on the topic of gender diversity for “many years.” The New York-based company manages more than $5.4 trillion in assets, many in index funds that buy broad swaths of the market, making it a top shareholder in most public companies. It has been pressured by activists and investors to back shareholder-fronted propositions and vote against obstinate boards to prompt better corporate citizenship. Chief Executive Larry Fink has encouraged executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than meeting short-term earnings targets. BlackRock’s own board includes 17 members, four of whom are women. ","

Disclosure forms produced for the Office of Government Ethics show Christopher Wray is also expected to receive millions more in payments when he leaves the King & Spalding law firm on his confirmation as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The forms and a letter from Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, a designated ethics official for the Justice Department, were made public ahead of Wray’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Wray would succeed James Comey, whom Trump fired in May. Lofthus said in his letter that Wray would not receive a bonus, severance or contingency fees on leaving his firm but would receive a refund of his money in the firm’s capital account and a final partnership share distribution, unless he decided to forfeit it. To satisfy ethics concerns, Wray will not participate for one year in FBI matters that involve companies or people represented by his former law firm, Lofthus said in his letter. He also will not participate in matters involving his former clients for a year, unless he obtains a prior authorization. Wray’s financial disclosure forms show he provided legal services to a number of large international corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Georgia-Pacific and SunTrust Banks He also provided legal services to Christie during the “Bridgegate” scandal in which two of the Republican governor’s former associates were convicted of plotting to close down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge for nearly a week in 2013 in an act of political retribution. If he is confirmed, Wray will have 90 days to dispose of millions of dollars worth of stock he owns in firms ranging from Apple Inc and American Airlines to Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil, Lofthus said. Wray served at the U.S. Justice Department from 2003 to 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department’s Enron task force. ","

12,,7132017,Reuters,7062017,"HANOI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Vietnam has extended an Indian oil concession in the South China Sea and begun drilling in another area it disputes with China in moves that could heighten tensions over who owns what in the vital maritime region. The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing’s relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China’s energy supplies and trade passes. Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company’s managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters. Part of that block is in the U-shaped ‘nine-dash line’ which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for  more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims. A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential. “Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China’s interventions in the South China Sea,” the official said. Vietnam’s state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June. Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold. Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam’s state oil firm, Spain’s Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates. Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd., has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain’s Repsol SA, which also has rights to neighboring block 07/03, Odfjell said. Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China’s claims. Odfjell’s Eirik Knudsen, V‎ice President for Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, referred further queries to Repsol, which declined to comment. PetroVietnam made no comment. When asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone “carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over”. “We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation,” he told a briefing in Beijing. Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was canceled around the time the drilling began. The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade. Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion “Blue Whale” gas concession off central Vietnam. They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam’s evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam’s coastguard. Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said. “We know they are unhappy again, but we are resisting the pressure – it is a traditional part of our relations with Beijing,” one official said privately. “Other parts of the relationship remain strong.” Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea. Hanoi’s growing defense and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances. The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China’s expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia. India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam’s waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country. On the agenda are transfers of naval vessels and missiles under a $500 million defense credit line announced last year. Next week, the navies of India, the United States and Japan will hold their largest joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal. ","

13,Sam Meredith,7132017,CNBC,7062017,"Just 100 companies have been identified as accountable for more than 70 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report published Monday. The Carbon Majors Report, published in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute, found that more than half of industrial emissions worldwide could be sourced to only 25 corporate or state-owned businesses. The report said the scale of historical emissions is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change since 1988. The same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established. Typically, large-scale greenhouse gas emissions data has been collected by country level. However, the Carbon Majors Report focused on fossil fuel producers in order to emphasize the role firms and their investors could play when attempting to tackle climate change in the future. The highest emitting companies over the last three decades included companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP. All three major oil and gas companies have faced heavy criticism for their respective environmental records in the past and have since embarked upon green investments. ExxonMobil announced in May last year it would start exploring carbon capture and storage, while BP and Shell have increased investment in renewables in recent years. ""If the trend in fossil fuel extraction continues over the next 28 years as it has over the previous 28, then global average temperatures would be on course to rise around 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century,"" the report said. Global average temperatures reaching such a level are likely to have potentially disastrous and irreversible effects on the planet's environment. In 2015's landmark Paris accord, almost all world leaders agreed to make sure global warming would stay ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and ""pursue efforts"" to limit a rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. On June 1, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement and start talks to re-enter or renegotiate a new accord. The report also found that around a fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions were supported by public investors. Therefore, it follows investors could have a significant impact in influencing the actions of board-level decision-making moving forwards, the report added. Meantime, almost 100 companies including Apple, Google and beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev have committed to 100 percent renewable power under the RE100 initiative. The initiative is made up of some of the world's biggest businesses, all of which are committed to renewable energy. ","Just 100 firms attributable for 71% of global emissions, report says",0.9517
14,Connor Lott and Sean O'Reilly,7132017,Fool,7062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) paid out a whopping $5.6 billion to the Bass family this week in exchange for some land in everyone's favorite basin, the Permian. A full transcript follows the video. Connor Lott: Sean, thanks so much for having me on here today. It's a real pleasure. I'm excited to be here and to be part of this. O'Reilly: Have you ever podcasted before? Lott: I have never podcasted, so this is a first on the bucket list. O'Reilly: You're going to send this to your parents, aren't you? Lott: I definitely am, yeah. O'Reilly: Do you listen to a bunch of podcasts? Lott: I do. Now I listen to all the Motley Fool podcasts. O'Reilly: Of course. Lott: Of course, yeah. I'm a loyal follower along with the dozens. And a couple other business ones, and some of those comedy ones, just for fun. O'Reilly: For sure. On today's show, we're going to be diving into a multibillion-dollar purchase by ExxonMobil of some oil acreage in Texas' Permian Basin. But first, Connor, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, your journey toward becoming a Foolish intern? Lott: I started listening to the Fool when I was serving in the Army. I was out at the 101st Airborne in Fort Campbell, and I wanted to learn more about investing. I didn't have a finance background, and I came upon the podcast, and the soothing voice of Chris Hill telling me about the ups and downs of the market every single day was -- O'Reilly: Was it a surreal moment when you finally saw him in person? Lott: I fanboyed really hard. O'Reilly: ""That's Chris Hill!"" [laughs] O'Reilly: We'll convert you before you leave. Lott: Absolutely. I was getting out of the army, and about a year ago I applied for the internship, and through fate and luck, I managed to land here, and it's been an incredible experience learning and being a part of this amazing company. O'Reilly: Awesome. You're one of two of the interns that the fool.com editorial department has with us for ... are you with us for two months? Lott: About two months, yeah, we'll say that. O'Reilly: Split the difference, yeah. It was endearing to me -- you aren't explicitly assigned to the energy, materials, and industrials bureau, but you were like, ""I really like the Permian Basin."" And I was like, ""Wow, this guy is nerding out over a part of Texas."" [laughs] But the stars aligned a little bit, because recently, ExxonMobil, everybody's favorite giant integrated oil major, spent a whopping $5.6 billion, and they paid this to one of America's richest families to expand their presence in the Permian Basin. Why don't you walk us first through some basic details of the deal, and what happened? Lott: This was a pretty earth-shattering move here by ExxonMobil. Back in January of this year, they announced they were going to be buy this huge, huge tract of land out in New Mexico and part of Texas in the Permian Basin sub-sector known as the Delaware Basin from the Bass family, that's out of Fort Worth, Texas. They believe the Permian is going to double their resources to over 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, basically, through acquiring these pieces of land and companies that the Bass family previously owned. Really, this entire area, the Permian has been a hot spot -- O'Reilly: It's the one still profitable area. Lott: It really is. It's like the Energizer Bunny. It keeps going. It's the most resilient play in the oil market right now in the continental United States, and it has been for years. O'Reilly: For sure. On this show, obviously, we've been talking about the Permian, with me and Taylor Muckerman and Tyler Crowe, for, unfortunately, years now. Well, fortunately. It was interesting to me, because for a long time, Exxon hasn't done the shale thing. They really haven't. Lott: Somehow they and Chevron have really stayed away from shale, which was kind of surprising to a lot of industry analysts, because this has been a huge growth area, especially for the past decade. It's done nothing but grow. O'Reilly: You would think those two companies would have literally an army of geologists and scientists being like, ""How do we stay at the forefront of getting oil out of the ground?"" You would have thought they would be in on this. Lott: And I'm sure they do, and I'm sure there's a lot of smart people at both Exxon and Chevron that have rang the cowbell saying, ""We need to get into the Permian."" And they've had a presence in the Permian for this entire time, but nothing to the extent of some of these smaller, more agile companies that have come in and really made a killing in there. It seems like the general corporate strategy for Exxon for the past decade or so has been, ""Let's look abroad, let's look into countries like Russia or Iraq or off the coast of Africa,"" where there are incredible reserves out there. O'Reilly: You hit the nail on the head. When you're as big as Exxon, which, their market cap is bigger than the GDP of most countries, you need to find something big to move the needle. This is the Warren Buffett-Berkshire Hathaway problem, too. It's like, ""What am I going to do that's going to make us tens of billions of dollars?"" So where has Exxon been making most of their money for the last 10 years? Lott: Like I said, they've been making most of their money with offshore drills, off of Africa and parts of Asia. They've been focusing also on expanding into the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic. Their tendrils have gone out all over the world, but they seemingly missed over Texas, which is ironic. I think with a company, like you said, as large as ExxonMobil, it's really steering the ship of state, and for eight to 10 years now, that ship has been concentrating on places like Russia and the Middle East and huge reserves that are still out there. And all of a sudden, now, the new CEO, Darren Woods, is steering that ship back toward Texas and what's available here in the United States. O'Reilly: Right. So, obviously, over that time period, they've been doing pretty well with the refining and the more advanced stuff, so that's good. Why does everybody love the Permian? This is the eternal question. Lott: Like you said, it's an incredibly resilient area for U.S. shale. Really, it's so cheap to produce there, and to drill out there. In terms of upstream production, you're looking at right around break even cost $30 a barrel, which even compared to the Bakken oil field up in North Dakota, that's hovering right around $38. So it's dirt cheap to produce there. O'Reilly: Not only that, but it's closer to Houston, where all the refineries are. You have pipelines. The stars have aligned for all of this. And that, it's light-years ahead of, everybody's been backing out of, I'm sure you've been listening to our recent shows, we've been talking about oil sands in Canada and all that stuff -- they need $70-$80 to start talking about profitability. Lott: Much more expensive, yeah. O'Reilly: What surprised you the most about this deal? Lott: I think what surprised me the most was we think of Exxon as this monolithic, huge company. And they've come in and obviously made a huge acquisition. But what they're doing now is contracting the drilling and the operations within this enormous tract of land that they now own, out to one of the companies they bought back in 2010, called XTO Energy Inc. XTO is lighter footprint. Management is basically giving as much leash as possible to go out there and really make rain for the corporation. Which I think has surprised a lot of analysts, and surprised the oil and gas industry, because you expect Exxon to come in and try to bureaucratically control everything. But again, I think they've realized over the past decades of producing that, ""Let's let XTO, who are very good at what they do, go in there and produce for us."" O'Reilly: That seems really smart. You have Exxon, market cap of $340 billion, and it's an admission that, ""Yeah, we probably aren't the best people for this. We have these guys, we bought them, they've been kind of hanging out over on their own."" I assume they're specialists in shale, right? Lott: Yeah. They absolutely are. They're going to be able to compete with companies out there like [Concho Resources] or Pioneer Resources and [Occidental Petroleum], who have been thriving in the Permian and are true masters of the craft. O'Reilly: That's actually been the funniest thing to me. I started doing the energy show essentially right before the crash happened. It was like the Valentine's Day Massacre, the Thanksgiving Day Massacre. OPEC said no more. Thanksgiving of 2014, oil just plummets. But it's been amazing to me, in the funniest thing has been how Pioneer's stock price, it's fallen a little bit, but they've been incredibly resilient, and their cost kept dropping, and it was just amazing to watch. So, bringing it back around. This is, of course, The Motley Fool. We like investing. Good deal, bad deal for Exxon? Lott: I think it's a good deal for Exxon. I don't think you're going to see a huge uptick or downtick in the share price for the company, but it's going to play out for the over the next 10 to 20 years. This is going to be a long-developed thing. The lease, the amount of money they're giving to the Bass family, has been divided up into almost $6 billion of Exxon stock, and a $1 billion cash payout until 2032. So they're going to be paying them yearly. Yeah. So, the Bass family, they're not hurting for money right now. O'Reilly: That is OK. [laughs] Lott: Yeah. I wish I had some connections. But no. They're going to be developing this until at least until 2032. That's the end of the payout to the Bass family, and that's kind of when I think they're geologists and scientists have estimated that maybe the wells start running dry. So this is a long-term play. You're not going to see a lot of volatility for Exxon. But down the road, it's going to continue to be profitable for them. And, again, it's so low-cost. O'Reilly: Yeah. I really do wonder, and this is just speculation, it's kind of known that, like we were talking about earlier, Exxon needs to find these giant reserves. Because the reserves are dropping. And it doesn't help that the price of oil is falling and you can't count something as a reserve if it's uneconomical. So I have to think this is not going to be their last deal. Lott: No, I don't think so. I think, like I said, Darren Woods, the new CEO, he has kind of an America-first policy now. The previous CEO, now our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, he was very internationally minded, which is great, but you run into a lot of complications -- O'Reilly: It's a hassle, quite frankly. Lott: It is. It's a huge hassle. There's diplomatic, there economic complications. So Darren is looking at, what can we best harvest from the United States? Yes, the price of oil is going to remain low for the foreseeable future more than likely. But we can continue to be profitable, and we can keep our costs low, which is the most important thing, as renewables are on the rise. O'Reilly: I think you cemented ExxonMobil's new strategy, it's the low-stress strategy. [laughs] Lott: Yeah, let's not worry about what's going on in Iraq of all places. Let's worry about-- O'Reilly: If we can make money here, low-stress ... Lott: Keep it in Texas, yeah. O'Reilly: For sure. Listen, man, thank you for your time, all your awesome research. I can't wait to do this again. Lott: Yeah. O'Reilly: And thanks again for becoming an intern. This has been really rewarding. Lott: Sean, thanks so much for having me on, it was a true pleasure, and I look forward to next time. ","

16,,7202017,Reuters,7132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Green groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to force Texas to toughen its stance on air pollution by using stricter language in permits it issues to oil refineries and power plants. Five separate lawsuits have asked a federal court in Washington to force EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to respond to petitions by the groups, including the Environmental Integrity Project and the Sierra Club. They want the EPA to intervene in permits issued to several companies by Texas’s environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The groups are claiming each permit is too weak and does not force the companies to do enough to protect air quality. The permits are for Exxon Mobil Corporation’s Baytown Refinery and Baytown Olefins Plant as well as Pasadena Refining System’s Pasadena Refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur Refinery and Southwestern Electric Power Company’s Welsh Power Plant, according to the court filings. The groups say Texas has not held the companies to a high-enough standard for air quality, a standard set not just by the federal Clean Air Act but by the state’s own environmental regulations. The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) on July 6 published a report claiming the state had only 3 percent of companies it found violating its air pollution regulations between 2011 and 2016. Spokespeople for the TCEQ and the EPA both said the agencies would not comment on pending litigation. But Andrew Keese, a spokesman for the TCEQ, referred Reuters to a statement the agency released on July 12 in response to the EIP report calling it “misleading.” “The success of the program is not measured in number of enforcement actions but rather by the state of air quality in Texas,” the statement read. Suits like Thursday’s filings are not based on any new concept. Previous EPA administrators have faced them as well. Gabriel Clark-Leach, a lawyer for the EIP, said the group had filed similar suits in the past and gotten the agency to respond to other requests for intervention in Texas’s state permitting process. He said the groups’ goal in filing the suits was to set a deadline for the EPA to respond to the their petitions. “The only way that we can make them answer our petition is by taking them to court and forcing them to do their job,” he said.

17,Bob Pisani,7202017,CNBC,7132017,"The state of the markets as earnings season begins: are we really overpriced? Earnings season begins this week in earnest, with reports from Bank of America, IBM and Visa, among others. But there is a growing chorus of voices insisting that the market is topping out. The worries revolve around four main complaints: 1) The bull market is eight years old, few bulls have lasted longer and it is reaching the end of its lifespan, 2) The Fed will have a tougher time than anticipated managing the reduction of its balance sheet and increasing rates, 3) Political developments (lack of progress on tax cuts) are already slowing the advance of the markets and 4) The stock market, particularly technology, is overpriced. Let's just tackle the idea that the market is somehow overpriced. Stocks are at historic highs because earnings are at historic highs and the global economy is improving. It's that simple. But is the market overpriced? The most important determinant of stock prices is forward earnings estimates. According to JP Morgan, the forward price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.5, which is slightly expensive but well within historic norms. The 20-year average is 16. Amen. Of course, there are pockets of the market that are indeed expensive. I'll give you two examples. Apple is trading at 16 times forward 12-month earnings. That's at the high end of where it has been for the past five years. Why? Because every analyst on the street has a buy on the stock and has convinced the world we are in the middle of some kind of supercycle for the upcoming iPhone 8. Maybe, but is it worth the 30 percent gain we have seen this year? That seems stretched to me. Even worse is the situation for Energy stocks, which are way above their historic averages. The forward P/E for the energy group is 26.3, versus 17.4 for the 20-year average, JPMorgan said. ExxonMobil, for example, was supposed to earn 99 cents a share for the second quarter. But that was on April 1 —a lifetime ago. Now that oil isn't rallying, the estimates have come down to 85 cents a share...and they're still going down! Bottom line: there are pockets of the market that are arguably overvalued, but the S&P itself is only modestly stretched. As for the imminent end of the bull market so greatly feared, I will once again give Goldman the final word: ""We don't see the end of bull market as long as the macro backdrop remains supportive with global growth above trend and low recession risk while central banks remain accommodative. And while global equities are at new highs, so are earnings."" The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Even as stocks were steadier Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, some charts still look dicey, and that could be a warning for the broader market. ",Here's why the stock market is not overpriced,0.9722

For long-term investors, the past eight years have truly been something special. Whereas the stock market has historically increased in value at a rate of 7% annually, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, the average annual return of the S&P 500 since the March 2009 low has been well over double that rate. But it's not just the big gains that investors are relishing. Capital returns have also been way up since 2009. According to data from Bloomberg of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, total capital returns, which includes dividends and stock buybacks, have more than doubled over the past eight years to around a combined $250 billion per quarter. Image source: Getty Images. As should be no surprise, the aggregate value of corporate share buybacks has outpaced the dollar value of corporate dividend payouts in practically every quarter. Common stock repurchases have been a particularly popular tool for publicly listed companies over the past eight years as interest rates have remained near historic lows. This has allowed businesses to borrow cheaply, but it's also made it unattractive to buy interest-bearing assets. The solution? A number of companies with excess cash on their books have turned to share buybacks, allowing them to use their cash to lower their outstanding share count and potentially lift their earnings per share. A lower price-to-earnings ratio could help lift a company's share price by making it look more fundamentally attractive. According to Bloomberg, four companies have combined over the past decade to repurchase a whopping $563 billion worth of their common stock. Let's have a quick look at these stock-repurchase giants and see if their efforts to create value made sense. Image source: Getty Images. When talking about the king of corporate buybacks over the past decade, no company has shelled out more for its own common stock than integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Bloomberg pegs the company's share repurchases at nearly $180 billion in that span. Over that time, ExxonMobil's outstanding share count has reduced from almost 5.6 billion shares to less than 4.2 billion. You might be under the impression that ExxonMobil's share repurchases are meant to appease investors who've struggled with a substantial drop in crude oil prices since 2014, but that's not the case. The company's share repurchases tend to be tied to the price of crude oil. When crude hit triple digits per barrel, ExxonMobil had more than enough extra cash to devote to share repurchases. With crude currently valued at less than $50 a barrel and margins way down, share repurchases have typically been coming in at less than $1 billion a quarter for the past two years. Thus we have a conundrum for the oil giant. Share repurchases make the most sense when it has tons of extra cash flow, but considering that oil company valuations tend to move in step with the price of crude, it means ExxonMobil has a tendency to repurchase the bulk of its stock near its highs. That's not a very efficient use of capital, and it could explain why ExxonMobil has underperformed the S&P 500 by 73 percentage points over the trailing decade. Image source: Apple. Surprise! A company with more than a quarter-trillion dollars in cash on its books (OK, so nearly all of it is overseas) is among the most aggressive when it comes to share repurchases. The chances Apple will continue to be a regular purchaser of its shares seems decent, but we may see a slowdown in the aggressiveness with which Apple rebuys its stock soon enough. Apple's core businesses aren't the issue. The expected launch of the iPhone 8 in the coming months should be huge for the company, and Apple has among the most loyal customers on the planet. The issue is that Apple has utilized debt to fund its share repurchases, and it's now lugging around nearly $99 billion in debt on its balance sheet. Even with almost $53 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, Apple will probably want to address its debt first before going gung-ho on future buybacks. Image source: Microsoft. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also been busy in the buyback department, having repurchased approximately $117 billion worth of its shares over the past 10 years. For the longest time, Microsoft's stock was stuck in a trading range. Yields were low following the Great Recession, which meant little interest in investing its cash hoard, and the company's history of creating value throughout acquisitions has been spotty at best. Purchases of Skype, aQuantive, and Nokia's handset business have all qualified as flops compared with initial expectations.  Thus, repurchasing its shares made sense by boosting EPS and making the already inexpensive software giant appear even cheaper. Since the end of 2007, Microsoft has lowered its share count by a tad over 2 billion shares, or slightly more than 20%. How's that worked out for shareholders? Pretty well, I'd say. Microsoft aggressively rebought its shares throughout the Great Recession, and even during its minor swoon in 2015.  Recently, shares of the company have traded at an all-time high. With the Windows operating system still generating high-margin profits for the company, and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carving out its space, regular share buybacks are icing on the cake for its shareholders. Image source: IBM. Last, but certainly not least, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has racked up an impressive $116 billion worth of share repurchases over the past decade. Considering that IBM has generated between $16.1 billion and $20.7 billion in operating cash flow every year since 2007, it's certainly had the funds to go around. However, IBM's focus on capital returns has less to do with weaker asset yields and more to do with weakness in its legacy businesses. IBM was late to the game in its efforts to focus on cloud computing. While it's been playing catch-up and is seeing substantial cloud growth, its legacy hardware and software businesses still account for the bulk of its revenue. In the company's recently reported second-quarter results, total sales fell by more than 4%, marking the 21st consecutive quarter that Big Blue's year-over-year sales dropped. How's management to keep shareholders happy while the company exacts another multi-year turnaround effort? Simple: Boost capital returns. In addition to a healthy dividend yield of nearly 4%, IBM has pretty steadily repurchased its common stock over the past decade. However, its biggest buys appear to have to come with its stock trading at $175 or higher, meaning IBM's share-repurchase program hasn't had its desired impact, despite reducing its share count by a third over the past decade. While Big Blue remains an intriguing income play, it's clear that the company has a long way to go to right the ship. ","
      
    4 Companies That Have Repurchased the Most Stock Over the Past Decade -- The Motley Fool

19,Tomi Kilgore,7202017,MarketWatch,7132017,"Published: July 18, 2017 7:16 a.m. ET Companies must report earnings growth to justify lofty stock prices after the major indexes have set repeated records this year By The second-quarter earnings season kicked off in earnest on Friday with the first reports from big banks, and investors should now brace for what will be a key test of sentiment. The stock market is at lofty levels after repeatedly setting records this year, and companies need to show earnings growth to justify the move. Even the Federal Reserve has pointed out that stock valuations are above historical norms, a view that was repeated this week by Chairwoman Janet Yellen in testimony to the House Financial Services panel. The FactSet blended year-over-year per-share earnings growth rate estimate for the S&P 500, which combines results for those companies that have reported (companies with a fiscal quarter that ended in May) with those still to come, stood at 6.3% on Wednesday. That’s below the 13.8% rate recorded for the first quarter, which enjoyed the easiest comparison of any period this year. That’s because the first quarter of 2016 marked the trough of the earnings recession, the long stretch of earnings declines that started in the third quarter of 2015. Analysts expect the second-quarter rate to improve as the earnings season gains pace and revisions move up. But the question for investors, is whether earnings valuations will improve enough to support the S&P 500 index’s

                                   rapid rise this year toward record levels. See also: Earnings recession is over, but it’s not enough to support stock market’s gains “We believe another quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500 in the second quarter is possible, given generally solid overall economic data, the strong rebound in energy sector profits, and solid financial and technology sector earnings gains,” said Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial. “Earnings estimates have been resilient and the ratio of positive to negative pre-announcements is as positive as it has been in three years.” Still, there are headwinds, including the strong dollar, a regular bugbear for companies that generate a lot of revenue overseas, and lower inflation, which gives companies less pricing power. There is also the uncertainty surrounding many of President Donald Trump administration’s promised policy moves, notably on health care and tax reform. Efforts to overhaul or replace the Affordable Care Act remain bogged down with Republicans unable to reach agreement among themselves. Tax reform is not expected until the details of a health care plan are known. White said he’ll try to evaluate just how much a policy boost is baked into analyst expectations this earnings season. He expects it is minimal, and is skeptical of any major initiatives happening in 2017, although tax reform, if it were passed, would be a strong boost for the S&P 500. The energy sector is expected to lead second-quarter gains, mostly because it is recovering from a very low base. In the more than two years that oil futures prices have drifted lower and lower, companies have slashed capex budgets, sold assets and made other moves to get back to growth in a low oil-price environment. The tech sector is expected to be second-strongest, driven by chip makers, which are enjoying strong demand -- and stock price gains -- thanks to the self-driving trend, the popularity of videogaming and the rise of artificial intelligence. But the entire consumer discretionary sector is expected to be a weak spot, given the severe stress in the retail sector as Amazon.com Inc.

The consumer discretionary and utilities S&P 500 subsectors are expected to report declines in earnings. One issue MarketWatch is watching for this earnings season is any comment on a new revenue-recognition accounting rule that will go into effect on January 1, 2018. The rule, named ASC 606, aims to create consistency between how revenue is recognized under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and International Financial Reporting Standards. It is expected to change the timing of the recognition of some revenue and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain customer contracts. It will have an impact on every sector, including banks. Read: Banks are beginning to admit a new rule on revenue recognition will have an impact Some companies have already talked about their preparations for the change, which could have a major impact on revenue. Here are four key sectors to watch this quarter: The energy sector is expected to post earnings growth of 387% for the quarter, and sales growth of 17%, according to FactSet, as it rebounds from the crushing losses of the past two years. But results will be uneven across the various segments of the market with the major integrated oil companies and refiners expected to enjoy the biggest gains and results from oilfield services companies expected to be more subdued. The outlook for the rest of the year is less certain, as oil futures prices have not performed as expected so far. 2017 was supposed to be another year of recovery, and it started with most experts cautiously optimistic about global oil markets on hopes that an improving global economy, more demand and a slowdown in production growth would result in higher prices and diminishing stockpiles. “Some of these elements have played out as expected, some have not,” analysts at Simmons said in a recent note. Global inventories are above a five-year average and higher than what they were at the end of last year, and thus “oil prices and energy stocks have unraveled,” they said. The average daily price of crude oil futures

Oil futures prices remain under pressure, trading under $50 a barrel in recent weeks. Although this week a higher-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and news Saudi Arabia has cut its oil exports have pushed prices higher, crude futures have amassed monthly losses for every month of the year but February.

                                   Netflix kicks off the tech earnings season on Monday with its report, with all but Apple, due Aug. 1, lined up for the next week. Facebook and Alphabet both face their second quarters reporting with a focus on GAAP metrics, which Goldman Sachs points out will have an effect on their gross margins, as well as the margins of tech as a whole. The second calendar quarter is historically Apple’s weakest, and the world’s most valuable company has admitted that consumers seem to be avoiding purchases of its biggest money maker, the iPhone, as they await a new version expected to launch late this quarter, as long as Apple can get past rumored issues with production. With Amazon, the focus will be on its big play for Whole Foods Market Inc.

                                   especially since its recent Prime Day promotion won’t factor in to the quarter being reported. Those large tech companies may determine the eventual outcome of tech’s earnings season due to their large weights in indexes and prominence for investors and the general public, but the sector will also be swayed by less-known companies. Semiconductors will be especially important this quarter, as chip companies sell their wares to the larger players to power gadgets being produced for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. The push for artificial intelligence has made Nvidia Corp.

                                   showed off its own new server offerings just this week in an attempt to beat back the competition. Investors will be looking for early returns on these new products, and hoping to hear more on the potential for future gains. The reports scheduled for the next few weeks will be important in determining which investor was right: The one that has bet long on these companies producing the technology that will produce huge financial returns for years to come, or the ones who took their profits and walked away last month. The record highs for Wall Street indexes rest on the outcome. The financial sector is expected to show earnings-per-share growth of 5.5% over a year ago, according to FactSet, which currently puts it in third place among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, behind energy and information technology. But the EPS growth estimate fell sharply during the quarter, from a consensus of 8.6% growth as of March 31. Investors should keep in mind that the year-over-year growth in EPS can be somewhat misleading. Banks have been aggressively buying back their own shares, because of “limited opportunities to allocate capital to value generating investments,” analyst Saul Martinez at UBS wrote in a recent note to clients.. “In fact, a substantial portion of EPS growth is currently driven by share buybacks, not earnings growth.” Of the banks reporting on Friday, EPS grew 22% for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

                                   EPS rose 1% while shares outstanding decreased 1.3%. “Ultimately, though, we question whether good EPS growth can be sustained once capital is optimized and rates normalize,” Martinez said. Bank investors had good reason to cheer the results of the most recent Federal Reserve stress tests, but analysts are less upbeat about earnings. “We see more misses than beats,” wrote Jefferies analysts in a July 5 note. J.P. Morgan analysts agreed, writing last week “We expect moderate 2Q earnings.” Chris Whalen, a longtime bank analyst, expects earnings to come in soft enough that the stocks will trade off. “There’s no real growth on the top line,” he told MarketWatch. After several lean years, banks have run out of expenses to cut to boost the bottom line. And most investors are finally starting to acknowledge that the hoped-for “reflation trade” isn’t coming, Whalen said. “The Trump Bump is dead.” On Friday, J.P. Morgan beat earnings estimates, but its stock fell as investors digested the numbers, which included a one-time legal benefit that boosted EPS. Trading revenue declined 14%, mostly due to a 19% drop in fixed-income trading. Citigroup also reported weak trading results, as did Wells Fargo, although it is less of a focus for the San Francisco lender. All three banks reported a slump in mortgage revenues. Next up are Bank of America Corp.

See now:  Mortgage lending takes a bite out of bank earnings despite brisk spring buying season Read now:  Bank earnings: Expect a weak quarter as hopes for a “Trump Bump” fizzle Retail is expected to be by far the weakest sector this earnings season. FactSet is expecting the consumer discretionary sector to show a decline of 2.2% in earnings, but a rise of 3.9% in sales. Retail has moved into the troubled position occupied by the oil and gas industries last year, with distressed companies dotting the sector, bankruptcies pushing up the U.S. retail loan default rate and retailers and brands struggling to generate sales while feeling the “Amazon effect.” But where the energy sector was reacting to the oil price, retail’s problem is a secular shift that will change the retail landscape.

Ten major retailers have filed for bankruptcy, more than all of last year.

20,,7272017,Reuters,7202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Green groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to force Texas to toughen its stance on air pollution by using stricter language in permits it issues to oil refineries and power plants. Five separate lawsuits have asked a federal court in Washington to force EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to respond to petitions by the groups, including the Environmental Integrity Project and the Sierra Club. They want the EPA to intervene in permits issued to several companies by Texas’s environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The groups are claiming each permit is too weak and does not force the companies to do enough to protect air quality. The permits are for Exxon Mobil Corporation’s Baytown Refinery and Baytown Olefins Plant as well as Pasadena Refining System’s Pasadena Refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur Refinery and Southwestern Electric Power Company’s Welsh Power Plant, according to the court filings. The groups say Texas has not held the companies to a high-enough standard for air quality, a standard set not just by the federal Clean Air Act but by the state’s own environmental regulations. The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) on July 6 published a report claiming the state had only 3 percent of companies it found violating its air pollution regulations between 2011 and 2016. Spokespeople for the TCEQ and the EPA both said the agencies would not comment on pending litigation. But Andrew Keese, a spokesman for the TCEQ, referred Reuters to a statement the agency released on July 12 in response to the EIP report calling it “misleading.” “The success of the program is not measured in number of enforcement actions but rather by the state of air quality in Texas,” the statement read. Suits like Thursday’s filings are not based on any new concept. Previous EPA administrators have faced them as well. Gabriel Clark-Leach, a lawyer for the EIP, said the group had filed similar suits in the past and gotten the agency to respond to other requests for intervention in Texas’s state permitting process. He said the groups’ goal in filing the suits was to set a deadline for the EPA to respond to the their petitions. “The only way that we can make them answer our petition is by taking them to court and forcing them to do their job,” he said.

21,Mark Kolakowski,7272017,Investopedia,7202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The weakening U.S. dollar is good news for U.S. corporations with significant sales abroad, promising to bolster their earnings growth and share prices. The biggest winners are likely to be: fast-food franchisor McDonald's Corp. (MCD), which gets 67% of its sales from abroad as well as semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), 87%, semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), 78%, oil giant Exxon-Mobil Corp. (XOM), 67%, and consumer products maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL), 71%. Nonetheless, these stocks are not outliers. For the S&P 500 Index (SPX) as a whole, foreign sales represent 43% of their total revenues, per data from S&P cited by CNBC. Source: CNBC, with data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and S&P Global Market Intelligence Aggregate earnings for companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) could increase by 0.5% for every 1% decline in the value of the dollar, according to analysis by Morgan Stanley (MS), as reported by CNBC. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley says that the dollar can fall by an additional 5% through the end of 2017, for a total decline of 13% for the year, CNBC adds. If so, this would mean a 6.5% boost for S&P 500 profits in 2018, per Morgan Stanley's analysis. Strategas Research Partners, meanwhile, estimates that the falling dollar could increase annual EPS for the S&P 500 by $2 to $3 in 2017 and 2018, CNBC says. The current S&P 500 EPS forecasts from Strategas are $124 for 2017 and $135 for 2018. This translates into a more modest EPS increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. Whatever the exact impact, an earnings boost from the foreign exchange markets will be a welcome development for investors. The dollar has declined by 10.7% against the euro for the year-to-date through Monday, according to Bloomberg Markets data, an even bigger decline than the 8.1% fall in the more broadly-based U.S. Dollar Index, which values the dollar versus a basket of six foreign currencies. Among the U.S.-based companies with large percentages of their total sales coming from the European market alone are: beverage distributor Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (CCE), 100%; online travel booking service The Priceline Group Inc.

22,Bob Pisani,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"Earnings are humming along, with gains of more than 10 percent now expected for the S&P 500 in the second quarter. There's one potential fly in the ointment: Big Oil. ExxonMobil, Chevron and other Big Oil names will begin reporting on Friday. Something unusual is happening: because oil never rallied in the second quarter as anticipated, analysts have been continuing to take down estimates for oil company earnings, and also continue to lower them for the third and fourth quarter. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but Big Oil is expected to be an unusually large part of the earnings gain we are expecting for the index in the second quarter. In fact, the earnings gains are very lopsided, concentrated in three sectors: Q2 earnings: who's contributing the gains Energy 27% Technology 25% Financials 23% The rest: 25% Source: Thomson Reuters Those numbers for energy have been dropping like a rock for months: Energy was expected to contribute about 40 percent of the expected gains for Q2 just a short while ago. That means there is more pressure on the other sectors to take up the slack. How did this happen? It happened because no one — not analysts, not strategists, not astrologers — can get the price of oil right. They can't even get the direction of oil right. I'm not kidding. In January, when oil was well over $50, analysts confidently predicted it would average around $56 by July, according to FactSet. Wrong! Not only did it not go up toward their target price, it promptly went straight down, bottoming around $42 in June. How come everyone has been so wrong? Because global oil producers are big cheaters, including Libya and Nigeria. And then Russia did essentially nothing to help cut production. Regardless: it's been bad news for oil stocks, which are closely correlated to the price of oil and, depending on the company, to natural gas as well (which also dropped). Beginning in April, analysts started scrambling to reduce earnings estimates for Big Oil. Here's what the estimate looked like for ExxonMobil: Exxon: Q2 earnings est.April 1: $0.99 July 1: $0.89 Today: $0.84 Source: Factset That's a 15 percent drop in expectations, a steep decline for such a big company. And analysts kept dropping their estimates in July, even after the quarter ended, which tells you that they are pretty clueless about the implications of such a big drop in oil on earnings and capital spending. And they're doing it for the third quarter estimates as well: they started at $1.07 on April 1, and are now down to $0.85, a 22 percent drop. It's even worse with Chevron, where estimates have come down nearly 25 percent: Chevron April 1 $1.13 July 1: $0.97 Today: $0.86 And you can see what this is doing to their stocks: with the S&P 500 up 10 percent this year, Exxon and Chevron are both DOWN 10 percent for the year. All in all, 25 of the 34 energy companies in the S&P 500 have seen mean EPS estimates come down in the month of July, according to FactSet. Aside from the price of oil, there's a broader problem for Big Oil: production growth is flat to declining for many of the big names, including ExxonMobil. For a multinational company like ExxonMobil, it's getting harder and harder to replace the oil that is pumped out of the ground with new oil. Paul Sankey, a well-respected oil analyst at Wolfe Research and a regular guest on CNBC, downgraded ExxonMobil last week, saying ""Based on historical volume performance, XOM is at risk of shrinking on a sustained basis."" One specific problem for Exxon, Sankey points out, is that it has lost a big driver of production growth: Russia. A huge joint venture with Russian oil giant Rosneft never panned out because Vladimir Putin invaded the Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions made it impossible for Exxon to move forward with development plans. Still, there are some bright spots. ExxonMobil has its massive chemical operations (about 30 percent of revenue) which have done well. Refining operations should also be strong. But Big Oil's biggest asset — and the reason it has kept the interest of a good part of Wall Street for the past couple years — is high dividends, funded by debt.. ExxonMobil pays a 3.8 percent dividend yield, Chevron 4.1 percent, far in excess of the S&P's 1.9 percent yield. Those dividends still are safe, but judging by the reaction this year it's clear that the stock is not going to move anymore on a dividend boost. It's going to move on a commodity boost. So what will ExxonMobil and Chevron say? The key issues will be production and capital spending. With oil below $50, the main hope is discipline on spending. We see this already in the smaller companies that have reported. Hess, Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhilips all said they would reduce capital expenditure plans for the year. Besides spending discipline, the hope for the bulls rests on the weight of history. First, both Exxon and Chevron have only fallen short of the consensus estimate three times in the last three years, and with estimates cut so drastically the bet now is they will hit the EPS target. Production and capital expenditures may be a different story. But the biggest help may be the lack of enthusiasm for the entire energy sector. Lindsey Bell, Investment Strategist for CRFA Research, summed up the state of the entire analyst community in a note to clients yesterday: ""[We] remain on the sidelines because we think earnings will be unimpressive, especially regarding guidance, despite numerous top line beats."" Of 18 analysts tracked by FactSet, only 5 have a Buy, 7 have a Hold, and 6 have a Sell. Given the ""Buy"" bias on Wall Street, that unenthusiastic endorsement that may end up being Big Oil's biggest asset. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Even as stocks were steadier Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, some charts still look dicey, and that could be a warning for the broader market.

23,Bill George,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"In his last earnings call as CEO, Jeff Immelt announced yet another disappointing quarter for General Electric. The pressure now mounts on Immelt's successor, John Flannery, to put the company back on track. GE's market capitalization tumbled $170 billion during Immelt's tenure. This year alone, GE stock is down some 18 percent, while the S&P index is up almost 10 percent. GE did not become the most iconic American company through financial engineering or margin analysis. While Flannery can create near-term value by focusing GE's business, he must look beyond immediate financial returns to build an enduring enterprise. Otherwise, GE risks becoming a holding company that buys and sells businesses opportunistically with no dominant strengths. If Flannery's mission for GE is simply a set of financial metrics, he will put the company on the opposite side of great, enduring companies like PepsiCo, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Mayo Clinic, and Merck. For GE to lead American industry for the next century, Flannery needs to determine an over-arching corporate strategy that leverages GE's global strengths to create sustainable competitive advantage. Then he needs to determine how to translate those strengths into leading market positions for each of its businesses through innovation and operational excellence. That's the only way GE can achieve superior long-term financial results. For decades GE has set the standard for the business community through the direction of the company. When Jack Welch took over leadership in 1981, he immediately undid the work of his predecessor, Reginald Jones, declaring that all GE businesses had to be No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective industries or risk being sold off. Welch quickly disposed of Utah International, Jones's largest acquisition. Then he streamlined the organization, taking out multiple layers of line and staff managers. Welch proceeded to build the most successful conglomerate of the 20th Century, with high-performing industrial businesses ranging from appliances to jet engines, balanced by high growth, high return financial businesses in GE Capital. Perhaps only a remarkable leader like Welch, with his incredible mastery of the details of every GE business, could run such a complex enterprise. Welch drove the businesses not only with a clear eye on near-term performance but through focused corporate initiatives like Six Sigma and  Session C that built management and leadership capabilities deep into the GE organization. Part of Welch's legacy is seen in the successful careers of GE alumni such as Dave Cote (Honeywell), Kevin Sharer (Amgen), Jim McNerny (Boeing), and Omar Ishrak (Medtronic). By the end of Welch's 20-year tenure, GE Capital accounted for 52 percent of GE's earnings. Security analysts loved GE's consistently strong results and earnings flexibility, but also began referring derisively to GE as ""a bank."" As Welch's successor, Jeff Immelt knew he needed to lessen GE's dependence on its financial arm and return it to its manufacturing roots, but he was reluctant to undo Welch's legacy. Immelt's hesitancy led to the liquidity crisis GE faced in 2008, triggered by the banking collapse. Immelt had to ask President George Bush to bail out what was once the world's most valuable company. Bush stepped up with a  $139 billion lifeline, putting GE into the same category as AIG, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup – not a club in which GE intended to be. Immelt may have moved too slowly, but he largely dismantled ""the house that Jack built,"" selling off most of GE Capital, divesting NBC, and spinning off legacy businesses like appliances, plastics and lighting. In recent years Immelt has remade GE as a high-tech, large systems company, building GE's expertise in energy systems, jet engines, and health systems. Yet it has been anything but a smooth ride, as volatility in oil prices has dragged down GE's energy business. Meanwhile, GE is running well behind industrial competitors like Honeywell, United Technologies, and Danaher. Their revenue growth, earnings, and stock prices have easily outpaced GE because they are committed to their core markets, never vacillating about their high-tech, market-leading businesses. While Immelt's strategy was directionally correct, impatient investors, frustrated after 16 years of lagging results, thought it was too little, too late. The GE board decided it was time for a change and chose Flannery to refocus GE on near-term results and immediate cash flow. Now Flannery must decide what GE's core business is. Is Flannery willing to invest heavily in the high-tech future Immelt envisioned? Or will he continue to dismantle the company, turning GE into a typical industrial company that grows at the rate of the economy and delivers a high proportion of its free cash flow to short-term investors? The answer will determine whether GE can sustain itself through economic crises and still lead American industry for the next 100 years. Flannery may be tempted to take this near-term view advocated by many GE investors, looking at each business purely through a financial lens. But too much surgery could kill the patient. Without a compelling purpose that inspires customers, employees, and shareholders, GE will lose its leadership position in American industry – an enormous loss for America's most iconic global business.

24,Patti Domm,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"The Federal Reserve's midweek meeting — coupled with a marquee list of corporate earnings reports — could make the week ahead among the most important of the summer. There are also several key economic reports, with the biggest being second-quarter GDP Friday, now expected at 2.5 percent. The Fed is not expected to take any action at its two-day meeting, but it could provide more details Wednesday as to when it might start to scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet and what it currently thinks about a now fourth month of weaker inflation data. For the stock market, however, it could be the make-or-break week for earnings season, with more than a third of the S&P 500 companies and 13 Dow stocks reporting. FANG names— Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet — are among about 180 S&P companies reporting, as are Exxon Mobil, Caterpillar, United Technologies, McDonald's, and Boeing. Stocks were mostly higher for the week, but the Dow lagged, with a small decline. The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 hit new all-time highs in the past week, but finished Friday slightly below those levels. The earnings season is expected to be strong but not as strong as last quarter's 15 percent growth. So far, 74 percent of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings estimates, and the rate of earnings growth, including those that have reported, is now expected at about 9.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. ""It plays in with other favorable facts,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""With the Fed being perceived as dovish, and the economy expected to do better in the second half of the year, we're still expecting 6 percent earnings growth. It's going to be good but not spectacular earnings."" As markets await the Fed's announcement, investors will also be watching the dollar, which was down about 1.7 percent against the euro in the past week and now down more than 10 percent for the year. Expectations of a more hawkish European Central Bank contrast with market views that the Fed is more dovish than it had been and is less likely to follow through with another interest-rate hike this year. There are only about 40 percent odds of a December rate hike, according to fed funds futures. Fed Chair Janet Yellen helped shift market expectations with her recent comments on inflation, so that will be the topic the market could react to most in the Fed's 2 p.m. statement Wednesday. ""The Fed will basically put more nuance around what they're going to do on the balance-sheet front,"" said Krishna Memani, CIO at OppenheimerFunds. Memani said the Fed could also address the fact that inflation has come in lower. Yellen and other Fed officials had been saying the drop in inflation was transitory, but in her recent remarks before Congress, she expressed some trepidation, which the market took as dovish. If the Fed formalizes more of that concern in its statement, ""the bond market is going to rally and the stock market is going to rally,"" he said. The Fed could just simply state that inflation has declined further, and that would be the equivalent of it upgrading its concerns, said James Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""The onus right now is on the market data to really show there is a pickup,"" Caron said. ""For the second quarter, we knew mathematically that inflation was going to hit a soft spot from the year-over-year effects, but there was also an expectation that we would pull out of that soft spot in the third quarter and fourth quarter,"" he said. Caron said the Fed could continue to discuss growth as rising moderately and may change the language on employment to reflect the strong jobs report in June. Caron said the Fed could continue to discuss growth as rising moderately and may change the language on employment to reflect the strong jobs report in June. ""If their dual mandate is full employment and price stability, they're getting an 'A' on one and not doing so well on the other,"" he said. Caron also expects the Fed to comment on its balance sheet. The Fed has long been done with its quantitative easing program, but one vestige of the program has been that it replaces the Treasurys and mortgages on its balance sheet as they roll down. It plans to slowly reduce the amount of replacement securities it is buying, thereby chipping away at the size of the balance sheet. ""Do they get a step closer to saying we're on track to reduce the balance sheet? Yes, I think that also gets communicated. That's probably a September event, and they announce it may start in the fourth quarter,"" he said. Focus will also be on Washington in the week ahead, where the Senate is expected to continue working to repeal Obamacare. Expectations are high on Wall Street that Congress will eventually turn to tax reform this year and have something to vote into law early next year. Many believe that Congress will be motivated to pass a tax cut bill by early 2018 to help Republicans keep their House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. ""I still think they're going to do something, and they have lots of time to do it. The more they fail on other things, the more incentive they have to compromise on this,"" Christopher said. The investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia will continue to get attention.

25,Jeff Cox,7272017,CNBC,7202017,"Investors just keep watching the stock market go ever higher, smashing new records on an almost daily basis. This week, they'll have plenty more to watch in terms of market-moving developments. The highlights: The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday for its last gathering of the summer. While you might think Fed-watching is just for policy dorks, it's not. As the U.S. central bank, the Fed, in addition to regulating banks, also sets the interest rates you pay for all kinds of debt. This week's meeting isn't expected to bring news of a rate increase, but the market is still watching closely. There could be some important language tweaks in the statement the Fed issues after its two-day session. The statement also is likely to include details about how the central bank unwinds all that money-printing stimulus it provided to the economy during and after the financial crisis. Here's some good advice from NerdWallet about how both consumers and investors should view Fed news: ""If you currently have credit-card debt, the clock is officially ticking to pay down the balance before the next Fed hike, which is likely later this year,"" said Kimberly Palmer, credit cards expert at NerdWallet, which provides information for investors and consumers. ""Making early payments by redirecting a portion of savings or income toward that debt can save consumers money by reducing interest payments while rates remain stagnant in the short term."" One of the big economic puzzles this year has been the decline in the housing market. Interest rates that are still low and there are plenty of buyers out there but the sector has struggled and contributed to the mediocre first-half growth of the broader economy. Hopes, however, are starting to rise. Mortgage applications, housing starts and permits all rose in June, providing some glimmer that real estate might be on the rebound. Investors this week will get housing data almost every day to put that theory to the test. Monday brings existing home sales, Tuesday is the closely watched Case-Shiller home price index, Wednesday is new home sales and Thursday will provide numbers on vacancies. Watch the Case-Shiller numbers especially to see if the buyers' market is still propelling prices higher. Speaking of the economy, Friday brings maybe the biggest data point of the week. That's when the government will release its first estimate for second-quarter growth. Economists expect GDP to have bounced 2.5 percent after a pretty dismal 1.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of the year. Even that number isn't terrific, but it could signal that the economy is getting out of its 2 percent doldrums. The Trump administration no doubt will be watching the second quarter GDP report closely. It's a really big week for company earnings as well. Investors watch the reports not only for learning what happened in the last quarter but how corporate executives view prospects for the rest of the year. So far, the news has been pretty good. Of the 19 percent of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, a glittering 73 percent have beaten analyst estimates on profits, and 77 percent have topped on sales, according to FactSet. Those are good numbers to tee up another week of earnings season. The highlights: The Fed isn't the only game in town this week in Washington. Some of the highlights on the political landscape include the likelihood that the Senate will vote, in a mostly ceremonial measure, on whether to proceed on the all-but-dead health-care bill, while the upper house also will take up the nomination of Randal Quarles to the Federal Reserve board on Thursday. If confirmed, Quarles will be the overseer for the nation's bank system. President Donald Trump will be in Youngstown, Ohio on Tuesday evening for a campaign-style rally. Arielle O'Shea, NerdWallet's investing and retirement specialist, offers this advice on what investors should be considering when it comes to the Fed: ""The market is getting pretty good at predicting the Fed's moves, and that's a good thing: It means investors are less likely to see turbulence from each Fed decision, provided the announcements don't throw out any curve balls. Because you're in this for the long game, you're positioned to ride out any market volatility, whether caused by a Fed meeting or another economic event. Instead of reacting to every change in the market, use this time to revisit your investment plan, make sure you're on track, and increase your savings rate if you have the means to do so."" So keep your focus long-term but understand what's happening in the short term. Seems like a great way to approach every investing week.

26,Sean Williams,7272017,Fool,7202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For long-term investors, the past eight years have truly been something special. Whereas the stock market has historically increased in value at a rate of 7% annually, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, the average annual return of the S&P 500 since the March 2009 low has been well over double that rate. But it's not just the big gains that investors are relishing. Capital returns have also been way up since 2009. According to data from Bloomberg of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, total capital returns, which includes dividends and stock buybacks, have more than doubled over the past eight years to around a combined $250 billion per quarter. Image source: Getty Images. As should be no surprise, the aggregate value of corporate share buybacks has outpaced the dollar value of corporate dividend payouts in practically every quarter. Common stock repurchases have been a particularly popular tool for publicly listed companies over the past eight years as interest rates have remained near historic lows. This has allowed businesses to borrow cheaply, but it's also made it unattractive to buy interest-bearing assets. The solution? A number of companies with excess cash on their books have turned to share buybacks, allowing them to use their cash to lower their outstanding share count and potentially lift their earnings per share. A lower price-to-earnings ratio could help lift a company's share price by making it look more fundamentally attractive. According to Bloomberg, four companies have combined over the past decade to repurchase a whopping $563 billion worth of their common stock. Let's have a quick look at these stock-repurchase giants and see if their efforts to create value made sense. Image source: Getty Images. When talking about the king of corporate buybacks over the past decade, no company has shelled out more for its own common stock than integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Bloomberg pegs the company's share repurchases at nearly $180 billion in that span. Over that time, ExxonMobil's outstanding share count has reduced from almost 5.6 billion shares to less than 4.2 billion. You might be under the impression that ExxonMobil's share repurchases are meant to appease investors who've struggled with a substantial drop in crude oil prices since 2014, but that's not the case. The company's share repurchases tend to be tied to the price of crude oil. When crude hit triple digits per barrel, ExxonMobil had more than enough extra cash to devote to share repurchases. With crude currently valued at less than $50 a barrel and margins way down, share repurchases have typically been coming in at less than $1 billion a quarter for the past two years. Thus we have a conundrum for the oil giant. Share repurchases make the most sense when it has tons of extra cash flow, but considering that oil company valuations tend to move in step with the price of crude, it means ExxonMobil has a tendency to repurchase the bulk of its stock near its highs. That's not a very efficient use of capital, and it could explain why ExxonMobil has underperformed the S&P 500 by 73 percentage points over the trailing decade. Image source: Apple. Surprise! A company with more than a quarter-trillion dollars in cash on its books (OK, so nearly all of it is overseas) is among the most aggressive when it comes to share repurchases. The chances Apple will continue to be a regular purchaser of its shares seems decent, but we may see a slowdown in the aggressiveness with which Apple rebuys its stock soon enough. Apple's core businesses aren't the issue. The expected launch of the iPhone 8 in the coming months should be huge for the company, and Apple has among the most loyal customers on the planet. The issue is that Apple has utilized debt to fund its share repurchases, and it's now lugging around nearly $99 billion in debt on its balance sheet. Even with almost $53 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, Apple will probably want to address its debt first before going gung-ho on future buybacks. Image source: Microsoft. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also been busy in the buyback department, having repurchased approximately $117 billion worth of its shares over the past 10 years. For the longest time, Microsoft's stock was stuck in a trading range. Yields were low following the Great Recession, which meant little interest in investing its cash hoard, and the company's history of creating value throughout acquisitions has been spotty at best. Purchases of Skype, aQuantive, and Nokia's handset business have all qualified as flops compared with initial expectations.  Thus, repurchasing its shares made sense by boosting EPS and making the already inexpensive software giant appear even cheaper. Since the end of 2007, Microsoft has lowered its share count by a tad over 2 billion shares, or slightly more than 20%. How's that worked out for shareholders? Pretty well, I'd say. Microsoft aggressively rebought its shares throughout the Great Recession, and even during its minor swoon in 2015.  Recently, shares of the company have traded at an all-time high. With the Windows operating system still generating high-margin profits for the company, and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carving out its space, regular share buybacks are icing on the cake for its shareholders. Image source: IBM. Last, but certainly not least, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has racked up an impressive $116 billion worth of share repurchases over the past decade. Considering that IBM has generated between $16.1 billion and $20.7 billion in operating cash flow every year since 2007, it's certainly had the funds to go around. However, IBM's focus on capital returns has less to do with weaker asset yields and more to do with weakness in its legacy businesses. IBM was late to the game in its efforts to focus on cloud computing. While it's been playing catch-up and is seeing substantial cloud growth, its legacy hardware and software businesses still account for the bulk of its revenue. In the company's recently reported second-quarter results, total sales fell by more than 4%, marking the 21st consecutive quarter that Big Blue's year-over-year sales dropped. How's management to keep shareholders happy while the company exacts another multi-year turnaround effort? Simple: Boost capital returns. In addition to a healthy dividend yield of nearly 4%, IBM has pretty steadily repurchased its common stock over the past decade. However, its biggest buys appear to have to come with its stock trading at $175 or higher, meaning IBM's share-repurchase program hasn't had its desired impact, despite reducing its share count by a third over the past decade. While Big Blue remains an intriguing income play, it's clear that the company has a long way to go to right the ship. ","
      
    4 Companies That Have Repurchased the Most Stock Over the Past Decade -- The Motley Fool

27,Travis Hoium,7272017,Fool,7202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big oil companies are starting to consider what the world will look like after the reign of petroleum is over. For example, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) recently announced it will invest $1 billion per year in clean energy -- a large number, but still a relatively small investment compared to its $25 billion in annual capital spending. Nonetheless, it was a public admission that clean energy is the future, not oil. Rival Total (NYSE:TOT) has, arguably, made the biggest investments in renewable energy, buying two-thirds of solar solutions leader SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), battery company Saft, and stakes in a number of solar power plant projects. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP) have also been in and out of the renewable energy business over the past decade, though both have taken steps back recently. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is really the only holdout among the hydrocarbon majors, continuing to focus solely on fossil fuels. What the rest of them are trying to do is create a path to a world beyond oil. But these old-school energy industry giants have a long road ahead to reach powerhouse status in renewable energy. Image source: Getty Images. Disrupting your own business is hard. When a company is running at full steam and generating cash, and has decades of profitable history to look back on, it's nearly impossible to admit that disruption is coming, even if it's staring you in the face. Microsoft could have produced a viable device to compete with the iPhone, but it was making so much money from Windows and Office that it didn't want to reinvent its business, so it missed out on the smartphone revolution. Sears, JC Penney, Walmart, and nearly every other major retailer are losing sales to Amazon.com, despite the fact that even a decade ago, it was easy to forecast that e-commerce was going to skyrocket. One could tell story after story about steady, profitable, incumbents that were unwilling or unable to make strategic shifts to new business models, despite the fact that they were able to see the changes coming to their industries years in advance. The idea of a company making a firm transition from oil to wind or solar energy seems simple enough. Fellow Fool investor Jason Hall recently asked me if I thought Total would buy out the rest of SunPower soon, as part of its path to the energy business of the future. That decision would seem to make sense for Total, on the surface, but I still view it as unlikely, for now. It's difficult to make a wholesale shift to a new business model, and Total is a perfect example of that. Sources have told me that when it bought its majority stake in SunPower, it asked the company for a 10-year plan -- something that's standard in the fossil fuel industry, where businesses chart their investments many years in advance. But SunPower had never crafted such a plan, because if they did, it would be obsolete in a matter of months. The solar industry changes so quickly that companies must constantly adjust on the fly. According to GTM Research, in 2007, the solar industry installed 2.5 GW of generating capacity worldwide. In 2017, China alone installs about that much every two weeks! No one could have predicted that a decade ago, let alone devised a plan then that still made sense in the current environment. It would be almost impossible for SunPower to be as nimble as it needs to be now under Total's corporate umbrella. The better strategy for Total would be to keep its major stake, support the company financially if that's needed, and maybe swoop in to buy the company outright in five or 10 years when the solar industry is mature and the oil business is dying. Just because oil companies don't have the corporate structure, dexterity, or know-how to run renewable energy companies today doesn't mean they'll all go down in flames with the decline of oil. Once the world definitively moves past peak oil consumption and energy companies see darker days ahead, they'll feel compelled to adjust their strategies. That's when their acquisitions of solar manufacturers and developers will likely begin in earnest. But buying into the still-evolving industry that renewable energy is today is too risky, even for big oil's balance sheets. There's a reason incumbent industries in general have a hard time adapting to upstarts that disrupt their businesses, even if they see the disruption coming. It's hard to turn away from a profitable model and leap to a new growth opportunity, even if it's one with a bright future like solar or energy storage. So, while it seems like the big oil companies are starting to take renewable energy seriously, a decade from now, they probably won't be the big energy players they are today. They're just not built to thrive in the fast-moving renewable energy industry. ","

28,Wallace Witkowski,7272017,MarketWatch,7202017,"Published: July 21, 2017 5:09 a.m. ET Plastics market expected to grow to $654 billion by 2020 By One of the most awesome monuments of the ancient world still around today is the Great Pyramid of Giza, but one study shows that the modern world is unwittingly producing a lasting plastic monument that could rival nearly 2,000 of those in less than two generations. At current rates, about 12 billion metric tons of plastics will make it into the world’s landfills by 2050, and that’s not counting those that will be recycled or incinerated, according to a recent study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Great Pyramid of Giza weighs about 6.5 million tons, so the amount of waste plastic expected to be put into landfills by 2050 would weigh as much as 1,846 Great Giza pyramids. Given that the stone in the Giza pyramid is about three times more dense than most plastics, those plastic pyramids would be much more massive in size. Plastic expected to make it into landfills by 2050 alone dwarfs the amount of plastic ever produced since the 1950s, when large-scale production of plastics began, the study noted. Since the 1950s, about 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced, with about 6.3 billion tons of that being discarded. Of that discarded plastic, only 9% has been recycled, 12% incinerated, and the remaining 79% going to landfills. The explosion in plastic production has happened only recently, however. Of the 7.8 billion tons of resins and fibers that go into making plastic produced since the 1950s, half, or 3.9 billion tons, has been produced just in the past 13 years, the study said. Much of that rise has been driven by the packaging market. And the global shift from reusable to single-use containers has resulted in a jump in throwaway plastic. “As a result, the share of plastics in municipal solid waste (by mass) increased from less than 1% in 1960 to more than 10% by 2005 in middle- and high-income countries,” the study noted. While the U.S. led the rise in the plastics industry since its inception, China has become a major player, now accounting for 28% of global resin production and 68% of global plastic fiber production, the study noted. The global plastics market is expected to reach $654.38 billion by 2020, driven by packaging, construction and automotive demands in emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, according to San Francisco-based market research firm Grand View Research. Some of the largest U.S. suppliers of plastics and raw materials for plastics include Dow Chemical Co.

29,,8032017,Reuters,7272017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is considering expanding light crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. If approved, construction could begin on Unit C in 2019 and be completed in 2022, said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. She declined to disclose the contemplated capacity or possible cost of the Unit C expansion. “These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude,” Huffaker said. The expansion would be part of the $20-billion ‘Growing the Gulf’ project announced in March by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods. While Exxon has mentioned potential expansion of light oil refining capacity at the Beaumont plant as part of that project, this is the first time the company has talked about Unit C and given a timeline for possible construction. Since at least 2014, Exxon has been considering the addition of a large distillation unit that would boost Beaumont’s crude oil refining capacity from 362,300 barrels per day (bpd) to between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd, sources told Reuters in 2014 and 2015. The contemplated crude capacity expansion was put on hold in early 2016 due to cuts in capital spending, sources said at the time. On Thursday night, sources familiar with Exxon’s plans said the company was now looking at adding a large crude distillation unit at the refinery. The two crude units currently at the Beaumont refinery are Units A and B. The last major expansion of a U.S. refinery was the 5-year, $10-billion addition of a crude distillation unit and other units at Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur, Texas, refinery which more than doubled its size to 603,000 bpd. The expansion was completed in 2012. The Motiva expansion was originally budgeted at $5 billion, but went through a year-long review in 2009. Last year, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity to Unit A at the Beaumont refinery, Huffaker said. ","

A bill has been passed by an overwhelming vote in both houses that prohibits U.S. firms from partnering with Russian companies on projects in which the latter hold more than a 33% stake. The bill is currently sitting on President Trump's desk. (See also: How Russian Sanctions Impact Western Companies.) Given that Russia is the world's second-largest natural gas producer and a major energy producer, the bill is expected to have a major impact on the business dealings of U.S. energy companies with their Russian counterparts. Here is a brief analysis of two energy companies whose bottom lines may be affected by the sanctions. (See also: How Easily Can Trump Remove Russia Sanctions?) Exxon Mobil has been present in Russia for the past 20 years. Its largest venture in Russia is a partnership with state firm Rosneft (RNFTF) to drill for oil in the Baltic Sea and Siberia, both of which are reported to contain sizeable reserves. The Irving, Texas-based company also owns 30% of the Sakhalin oil fields through the Sakhalin consortium. Rosneft owns 20% of the oil fields, which began production earlier this year. Exxon Mobil was not allowed to collect revenue from the oil fields under the 2014 sanctions put in place by the Obama administration. Then, ExxonMobil estimated that it had potentially lost $1 billion because its joint ventures with Russian firms were ""wound down."" (See also: Exxon Mobil Profit Disappoints Wall Street, Chevron Shines.) Chevron is a relative newcomer to Russia. Even as oil majors made a beeline to Russia after disintegration of the former Soviet Union, Chevron didn't have much presence in the country until the turn of this decade. Its biggest recent investment in the region is in a $36.8 billion plan to boost oil production in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet Republic. Chevron is the largest stakeholder with a 50% share of the project. The other international partners in the project are Exxon Mobil, which holds a 25% stake, and Russian state firm Lukoil (LUKOY), which holds 5%. The composition of that stakeholding ensures that Chevron will not suffer adverse consequences from the sanctions. CNN reported that the language of the new sanctions bill ""ensures that it didn't affect a major pipeline used to transport oil from Kazakhstan through Russia to Ukraine.""

Amazon shares declined 2.5%, having recovered from deeper losses earlier. The pullback in the broader stock market came amid a few blemishes in relatively strong earnings season shows that investors who are skittish about high valuations are taking money off the table while those who are more confident of earnings growth are supporting levels, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager of Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “The fact that the market has recovered most of the losses from early this morning is healthy and we haven’t really seen it fallen much from its peak,” Nolte said. Some analysts suggested that this week’s weakness was due to seasonal positioning. “It is not surprising for market participants to take profits after a big rally, especially going into August, which is historically a difficult month,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Despite this week’s modest losses, the S&P 500 is up 2.1% since the start of the month and up 10.4% year to date. The failure of a Republican-led attempt to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act in the wee hours of Friday morning—viewed as a proxy for President Donald Trump’s ability to deliver on previously pledged pro-growth legislations—may also have dampened investor sentiment, some analysts said. “The reality is that the clock is ticking for this administration to deliver something to their voters,” Krosby said. “Republicans also need to score victories before they hit the campaign trail, but so far, there is no sign of any tax relief that Trump voters have been expecting.” Read: Amazon’s free-spending ways hit earnings, but don’t expect a shift to thrift Some analysts suggested that any pullback in highflying “FAANG” stocks—Facebook Inc.

Economic docket: On the data front, a second-quarter reading on gross domestic product rose 2.6%, below the 2.8% expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. First-quarter GDP growth was revised to 1.2% from 1.4%. The cost of employing the average U.S. worker rose 0.5% in the second quarter but showed little acceleration despite the tightest labor market in years. The final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer-sentiment survey for July was lifted to 93.4 from a preliminary 93.1. That’s a decline, however, from June’s level of 95.1.

Here’s how all 30 Dow stocks contributed to reaching 22,000, through Wednesday: The 12 Dow stocks that have declined erased about 594 points from the Dow. That loss was mostly canceled out by the 13 smallest gainers, meaning the heavy lifting was done by just a handful of stocks. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

34,,8102017,Reuters,8032017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is considering expanding light crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. If approved, construction could begin on Unit C in 2019 and be completed in 2022, said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. She declined to disclose the contemplated capacity or possible cost of the Unit C expansion. “These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude,” Huffaker said. The expansion would be part of the $20-billion ‘Growing the Gulf’ project announced in March by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods. While Exxon has mentioned potential expansion of light oil refining capacity at the Beaumont plant as part of that project, this is the first time the company has talked about Unit C and given a timeline for possible construction. Since at least 2014, Exxon has been considering the addition of a large distillation unit that would boost Beaumont’s crude oil refining capacity from 362,300 barrels per day (bpd) to between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd, sources told Reuters in 2014 and 2015. The contemplated crude capacity expansion was put on hold in early 2016 due to cuts in capital spending, sources said at the time. On Thursday night, sources familiar with Exxon’s plans said the company was now looking at adding a large crude distillation unit at the refinery. The two crude units currently at the Beaumont refinery are Units A and B. The last major expansion of a U.S. refinery was the 5-year, $10-billion addition of a crude distillation unit and other units at Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur, Texas, refinery which more than doubled its size to 603,000 bpd. The expansion was completed in 2012. The Motiva expansion was originally budgeted at $5 billion, but went through a year-long review in 2009. Last year, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity to Unit A at the Beaumont refinery, Huffaker said. ","

35,Thom Tracy,8102017,Investopedia,8032017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The idea of retirement typically appeals more to individuals who have been in the workforce for two or three decades. A 23-year-old college graduate likely has less focus on closing out a career than a 55-year-old wage earner who has planned and saved for 30 years. Despite the stage of life, all individuals should plan for retirement accordingly, positioning their assets with an eye on risk tolerance and time horizons. Every retirement portfolio needs growth components regardless of whether an individual is 65 or 25. The difference manifests in what percentage should be devoted to a security, such as a technology stock. Tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) plow earnings back into research and development (R&D), leading to potential share price appreciation. Investors with a longer time to retirement can afford larger allocations devoted to growth investments. Pre-retirees with a five-year time horizon need to focus on stability but need not eschew equities completely. A large, established company such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) has a solid history of share price stability and a dividend yield of 3.37%, as of Aug. 2, 2016. Stretching for high coupon payments poses risk in the arena of high-yield bonds. Companies issuing such bonds may be in financial distress. Default risk becomes more of a reality with high-yield bonds than the debt of a company whose issues are rated higher. Younger investors with 20 to 30 years until retirement have more time to shake off principal loss resulting from default. A 60-year-old ultra-conservative employee on the edge of retirement may wish to hold a large percentage of U.S. government bonds for income and preservation of capital. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields 2.26% as of Aug. 5, 2017, and is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Hard assets such as residential or commercial real estate are an excellent means to grow capital and generate income, which can be invested for retirement or used to purchase other properties. The daily grind of property management often becomes burdensome for older investors who, as a more leisurely lifestyle approaches, may wish to sell off these assets in favor of municipal bonds or utility stocks. Investing in physical gold bullion or coins has its drawbacks. Storage becomes difficult for larger amounts of the physical asset, but gold is an excellent store of value and more than tripled in price from 1996 through August 2017, when 1 ounce moved from $369 to $1,261. Gold investing appeals to hard asset investors of all ages with a growth investment objective. As the pooled security offered by nearly all 401(k) plans, mutual funds are an easy way for older investors to maintain growth exposure while diversifying assets for a more stable play than individual stocks or bonds. A balanced mutual fund such as the Fidelity Balanced Fund (""FBALX"") holds a medium risk profile with a five-year average annual return of 10.23% through Aug. 5, 2017. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) present a way for young, aggressive investors to reach very specific markets that would otherwise be inaccessible. Investing in the VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (NYSE ARCA: VNM) is an inexpensive way to gain exposure to emerging markets while time horizons are lengthy. When the 401(k) and individual retirement accounts (IRA) are maxed out, fixed and variable annuities offer a way to continue contributions to a tax-deferred account in which earnings grow unencumbered until withdrawal at retirement. Annuities also have insurance wrappers that guarantee account values to beneficiaries. Fixed annuities are backed by the issuing insurer and often have higher rates than bank certificates of deposit (CD). Regardless of age, all retirement investors need a place to park funds for easy access and risk-free returns. Mutual fund money markets and savings accounts offer maximum safety and liquidity if needed for an emergency, or a spontaneous purchase. Cash equivalents lay a solid foundation on which the balance of riskier retirement investments can be layered. ","Top 10 Investments for Your Retirement Plan (XOM, VNM) | Investopedia",0.9963

42,Fred Imbert,8172017,CNBC,8102017,"Despite this week's minor pullback, stocks still look solid on the surface. But a deeper look inside the market shows signs the bull is starting to crack. Entering Friday's session, 200 S&P 500 components, or 40 percent, were in correction territory. A stock or an asset class enters a correction when it falls at least 10 percent from its 52-week high. Among the stocks in a correction were e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobil, Starbucks and Netflix. Below is a table highlighting the S&P 500 components that are in a correction. The U.S. stock market has already posted strong gains for the year, with the S&P advancing about 10 percent in that time. Leading the charge higher in 2017 has been the tech sector, which is up more than 20 percent year to date. However, there are more signs of an internal breakdown. Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, pointed out in a note Thursday that less than 60 percent of stocks in the Russell 3000 are trading above their 200-day moving average, a key long-term technical metric. ""The Russell 3k represents 98% of U.S. equities. Bulls don't want to see this hold under 60% for too long,"" Krinsky said. ""While not all negative divergences lead to negative outcomes, we are seeing enough of them to warrant some caution as we enter the worst part of the calendar.""

43,,8242017,Reuters,8172017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two Harvard University researchers said in a study published on Wednesday they had collected data proving that Exxon Mobil Corp made “explicit factual misrepresentations” in newspaper ads it purchased to convey its views on the oil industry and climate science. In an article in the journal Environmental Research Letters, researchers Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes said they examined 187 documents, including internal memos, peer-reviewed papers by Exxon scientists and “advertorials” that ran in The New York Times - paid advertisements in the style of opinion pieces. The researchers said they used a social science analysis method to turn statements in the documents into data points that could be counted and compared to each other. Supran and Oreskes said that as early as 1979, Exxon scientists acknowledged burning fossil fuels was adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise, but they said the company’s position in newspaper ads remained significantly different by consistently asserting doubt about climate science. The study was funded by the Rockefeller family philanthropies, which previously supported a campaign to prove Exxon knew more than it publicly admitted about climate change. That campaign used the slogan #ExxonKnew. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri called the study “inaccurate and preposterous” and said the researchers’ goal was to attack the company’s reputation at the expense of its shareholders. “Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,” he said. He also noted that Oreskes spearheaded the #ExxonKnew campaign. Oreskes said the Rockefeller family funding did not affect the study’s outcome. She said the impetus for the study came from Exxon’s responses to reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times in September 2015 and October 2015, respectively, that Exxon’s scientists had long known of the dangers fossil fuels posed to the earth’s climate. “They accused the journalists of cherry-picking,” Oreskes said of Exxon’s responses. “They also posted a collection of documents on their website. They said ‘read the documents and make up your own mind.’ We thought that was an excellent opportunity.” Oreskes and Supran pointed to a 2000 Exxon advertorial that said a U.S. government report on climate change put the “political cart before the horse” and was “based on unreliable models.” In his statement on Wednesday, Silvestri offered two examples from advertorials that Exxon had placed in The New York Times, both published in 2000, which he said showed the company did not try to cast doubt on climate change. One statement read: “Enough is known about climate change to recognize it may pose a legitimate long-term risk and that more needs to be learned about it.” ","
                Harvard researchers say Exxon misled public on climate science | Reuters",-0.7615
44,Tom DiChristopher,8242017,CNBC,8172017,"Exxon Mobil misled the public about climate change for years even as its research echoed the growing scientific consensus that global warming is real and caused by human activity, a new study finds. The conclusion is based on a study by two Harvard University researchers, who used social science methods to compare what Exxon Mobil said in nearly 200 scientific publications and internal communications on climate change with what they presented in three dozen advertisements over 15 years. The researchers' takeaway is that the more publicly available advertisements sowed doubt that climate change is real and caused by humans, while the scientific studies and private exchanges more openly acknowledged that scientific fact. ""We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science — by way of its scientists' academic publications — but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that Exxon Mobil misled the public,"" the researchers wrote. The findings potentially add grist to the mill as a number of attorneys general, including New York's Eric Schneiderman, continue to investigate whether Exxon misled shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also probing how the oil major values its fossil fuel reserves in light of global warming. ""As detailed in our filings in New York court, the Attorney General's investigation of Exxon Mobil has uncovered significant evidence indicating that Exxon may have misled New York investors and consumers about the risk of climate change to the company,"" Amy Spitalnick, press secretary for the New York State Office of the Attorney General told CNBC. ""We will continue to vigorously pursue our investigation, regardless of Exxon's unprecedented campaign of delay and distraction."" The Harvard researchers, Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes, presented their findings in a peer-reviewed article in the journal Environmental Research Letters. In a New York Times op-ed, they said they were inspired to apply empirical analysis to the documents after investigations by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times put forward the notion that Exxon obscured what it long knew about climate change. One key finding is that Exxon acknowledges that climate change is real and human-caused in 83 percent of peer-reviewed papers and 80 percent of internal documents. Yet 81 percent of editorial-style advertisements placed in the New York Times from 1989 to 2004 express doubt. ""In short, Exxon Mobil contributed quietly to climate science and loudly to raising doubts about it,"" Supran and Oreskes said in the op-ed. A March 2000 advertorial by Exxon opens this way: ""Knowing that weather forecasts are reliable for a few days at best, we should recognize the enormous challenge facing scientists seeking to predict climate change and its impact over the next century."" The Harvard report was funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund, which has supported other work to reveal what Exxon knew about climate change and what it publicly disclosed. ""The study was paid for, written and published by activists leading a five-year campaign against the company. It is inaccurate and preposterous,"" Exxon Mobil said in a statement. ""The study claims that Exxon Mobil advertorials in the New York Times cast doubt on climate science, which is the researchers' opinion and not supported by fact,"" the company added, noting its advertisements pointed to potential risks associated with climate change. CNBC contacted about a dozen of Exxon Mobil's largest investors. They either declined to comment or did not respond. Exxon Mobil shareholders recently approved a nonbinding proposal that asked Exxon to disclose the impacts to its business of global climate goals enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to prevent temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Baldwin Brothers, a wealth management firm with $800 million of assets under management, has been lobbying Exxon to disclose risks to its business related to climate change since 2014. Managing Director Dylan Sage said he grew concerned that policies aimed at mitigating global warming would leave much of Exxon's reserves stranded in the ground. ""We wanted to have a better framework to understand under that scenario how much equity of ours is at risk,"" he said. ""Subsequently, we've gotten out of a lot of our Exxon shares when they wouldn't take seriously the risks to their business model around a low-carbon scenario,"" he said.

45,Tom DiChristopher,8242017,CNBC,8172017,"Chevron Vice Chairman Michael Wirth might be the man to shepherd the oil major into the industry's uncertain future following a report that CEO John Watson will step down. Wirth, who has spent about 35 years at Chevron, is a leading candidate to replace Watson, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Sources told the Journal the decision has not been finalized and could change. The move would put a refining specialist at the helm of the San Ramon, California-headquartered integrated oil company. Wirth holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and spent roughly 10 years as executive vice president of Chevron's downstream and chemicals business — a segment responsible for refining crude oil into gasoline and operating the massive facilities that produce petrochemicals like plastics. Refining operations have been critical to protecting the balance sheets at giant oil and gas companies at a time of persistently low oil and gas prices. Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total have also elevated refining specialists to the top position, the Wall Street Journal notes. In a statement to CNBC, Chevron said, ""We cannot confirm the Journal's reporting. As a practice, we do not comment on rumor or speculation."" Wirth, 56, became vice chairman of the board of directors in February. He also serves as executive vice president for Midstream and Development, a title he has held since last year. In his current role, Wirth is responsible for a broad portfolio that includes Chevron's business transporting fossil fuels and its unit that generates and manages power from gas-fired facilities and renewable sources. He is also in charge of Chevron's trading hubs, which buy and sell crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. According to Chevron's website, Wirth also plays a role in corporate strategy, business development, and policy, government and public affairs. Wirth worked in the refining and chemicals business prior to his current role. Before that, he was president of global supply and trading from 2003 to 2006. Having served in engineering, construction, and operations positions since joining Chevron in 1982, Wirth became president of marketing for Chevron's Asia, Middle East and Africa business in 2001. He also served on the board of directors for Caltex Australia Limited and GS Caltex Corporation, Chevron's main gasoline and diesel brands in the Asia-Pacific region. Wirth has also served on the boards of the San Francisco 49ers Foundation and the Tiger Woods Foundation. ","Meet Michael Wirth, the man who could soon lead Chevron",-0.5267

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

The transition is expected to be announced next month, although Watson’s successor hasn’t yet been finalized by the board and could change, the people said.

52,John Bromels,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","
      
    What Hurricane Harvey Means for Oil Stocks -- The Motley Fool

53,Sean Williams,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now.

Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

54,Philip van Doorn,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions. Darren Woods took over the top job at Exxon Mobil Corp.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

                                   which was established in December 2014 and invests in derivatives so that the fund’s value will go up when S&P 500 companies raise their dividends. Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

59,John Bromels,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","

60,Sean Williams,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

61,Philip van Doorn,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

It was established in 1897 and is a global group of energy companies that sold 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Much of Shell’s revenues come directly from its motorists' division, which sells fuel, engine oil, lubricants and credit cards. Shell offers credit card options to seven different countries around the world. In the United States, Shell offers its customers three options for payments: the Shell Drive for Five, Platinum Select MasterCard, and the Shell Saver card. The Shell Drive for Five Card is a credit card that can only be used to purchase items at a Shell gas station or convenience store. The Platinum Select MasterCard can be used for credit purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted. The Saver card works like a debit card, where users can link a checking account to pay for their gas purchases. Shell has an online website that will provide all three applications. All require applicants to put in their personal information such as name, address and contact phone number. The Saver card requires the applicant’s driver’s license information as well as two security codes in the event of a lost password. From there, a checking account number must be provided to link to the card. The two credit cards require the most information, such as date of birth, Social Security number, and annual salary amount. Both will run a credit check on the applicant, and approval is based on the applicant's credit history. Each of Shell’s payment cards has its own set of reward or benefit programs. The Drive for Five card saves 5 cents for every gallon of Shell fuel purchased. Customers with the Platinum Select MasterCard who spend at least $500 during a billing cycle can get 10 cents per gallon credit the following business cycle. Those who spend $1,000 to $2,499.99 will get 15 cents per gallon credit, and anything more than $2,499.99 will get 20 cents per gallon credit. The Saver card offers its users a savings of 2 cents on each gallon of gas purchased. Any of the three cards would be suggested for customers who frequently purchase gas from Shell stations. Both the Drive for Five and Saver cards can only be used at Shell stations, so the more Shell gas that is pumped, the more benefits accrue. The Platinum MasterCard would be good for anyone who frequently uses credit cards to make purchases and would like reduced gasoline prices. In order to be eligible for a credit on gas prices, you must make $500 or more in purchases using the card. Those who use car travel regularly are excellent examples of who would benefit from a Shell payment card. Companies that employ a traveling sales force would also benefit with a Shell rewards card program. Energy company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) offers an alternative to the Shell program. Exxon offers a Smart card that lets customers earn 12 cents off every gallon for the first two months, then 6 cents off every gallon thereafter. Further, there are several other credit cards that offer reward points which can be an alternative to using a Shell payment card. Many credit cards offer better rewards when used at gas stations. For example, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card lets its users earn 3% on gas purchases of at least $10 up to $2,500 per month.

64,Brian Mathews,12222016,Investopedia,12152016,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Royal Dutch Shell plc (NYSE: RDS.A), also known as Shell, is one of the oldest and most recognizable brands in the world. It was established in 1897 and is a global group of energy companies that sold 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Much of Shell’s revenues come directly from its motorists' division, which sells fuel, engine oil, lubricants and credit cards. Shell offers credit card options to seven different countries around the world. In the United States, Shell offers its customers three options for payments: the Shell Drive for Five, Platinum Select MasterCard, and the Shell Saver card. The Shell Drive for Five Card is a credit card that can only be used to purchase items at a Shell gas station or convenience store. The Platinum Select MasterCard can be used for credit purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted. The Saver card works like a debit card, where users can link a checking account to pay for their gas purchases. Shell has an online website that will provide all three applications. All require applicants to put in their personal information such as name, address and contact phone number. The Saver card requires the applicant’s driver’s license information as well as two security codes in the event of a lost password. From there, a checking account number must be provided to link to the card. The two credit cards require the most information, such as date of birth, Social Security number, and annual salary amount. Both will run a credit check on the applicant, and approval is based on the applicant's credit history. Each of Shell’s payment cards has its own set of reward or benefit programs. The Drive for Five card saves 5 cents for every gallon of Shell fuel purchased. Customers with the Platinum Select MasterCard who spend at least $500 during a billing cycle can get 10 cents per gallon credit the following business cycle. Those who spend $1,000 to $2,499.99 will get 15 cents per gallon credit, and anything more than $2,499.99 will get 20 cents per gallon credit. The Saver card offers its users a savings of 2 cents on each gallon of gas purchased. Any of the three cards would be suggested for customers who frequently purchase gas from Shell stations. Both the Drive for Five and Saver cards can only be used at Shell stations, so the more Shell gas that is pumped, the more benefits accrue. The Platinum MasterCard would be good for anyone who frequently uses credit cards to make purchases and would like reduced gasoline prices. In order to be eligible for a credit on gas prices, you must make $500 or more in purchases using the card. Those who use car travel regularly are excellent examples of who would benefit from a Shell payment card. Companies that employ a traveling sales force would also benefit with a Shell rewards card program. Energy company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) offers an alternative to the Shell program. Exxon offers a Smart card that lets customers earn 12 cents off every gallon for the first two months, then 6 cents off every gallon thereafter. Further, there are several other credit cards that offer reward points which can be an alternative to using a Shell payment card. Many credit cards offer better rewards when used at gas stations. For example, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card lets its users earn 3% on gas purchases of at least $10 up to $2,500 per month. Similarly, the Chase Freedom credit card offers up to 5% cash back on gas station purchases every three months. The Drive for Five credit card has an APR of 25.24% on purchases and an APR of 29.99% on cash advances. The Platinum Select MasterCard has an APR of 24.24% on purchases and an APR of 28.24% on cash advances. Both cards have the same penalty fees for late or return payments of up to $37.

65,Eric Chemi,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"What do companies like General Dynamics, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil have in common? They're a few of the names with board members joining the next presidential Cabinet, if Donald Trump gets his way. Directors from those companies and others — including Wells Fargo, News Corp. and Ingersoll-Rand — are going to be nominated for high-level government positions in the new administration. And those stocks have already seen a benefit to their share prices since the election, beating the overall market. Future government officials such as James Mattis, Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson and Elaine Chao all serve on at least one board of a major publicly traded company. Here's a list, compiled by CNBC and corporate data firm Equilar: We can go one step further and put all these companies into their own basket of stocks. Let's call it the ""Trump Cabinet index"" — and that index has outperformed the overall market since the election. Since Nov. 8, this basket was up 14 percent through Friday, surpassing the S&P 500's move of 6 percent. Specifically, 10 of 15 companies are beating the market. To be clear, none of these people actually serve in the government yet, since almost all of them will require Senate confirmation. And that's not a slam dunk: There's already been plenty of public discussion from current senators about whether Exxon Mobil CEO Tillerson is an appropriate choice to be secretary of State, especially because of his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But for now the index is worth following. We'll be updating the index as time goes on depending on who is in and out of the government, and which companies they have direct relationships with. It will be interesting to watch whether these companies get an added benefit for having one of their own in government, or whether they sell off harder than normal when the difficulties of managing the nation become a daily reality. Some notes about the index: We did not include WWE because Linda McMahon is no longer on its board of directors, having left to run for senate several years ago. But we did include Goldman Sachs, because Cohn is on that board. Even though Cohn's future nomination as director of the National Economic Council doesn't require Senate confirmation since it's not a Cabinet position, we thought it was a relevant and powerful enough job to include in the basket. We also included Steve Mnuchin's connection to Sears, which he gave up in early December specifically to join the incoming team. ",'Trump Cabinet index' is outpacing the market since election,0.9411
66,Jacob Pramuk,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"In one of his final pitches to voters last month, Donald Trump eviscerated what he called a ""corrupt machine"" of entrenched political leaders, corporations and donors that he said damaged the American working class. The video tied his opponent Hillary Clinton to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and a major Democratic donor, billionaire financier George Soros. ""For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind,"" Trump said in the Nov. 6 video. Since his election, though, Trump has stocked his administration with Blankfein's right-hand man at Goldman and two other alumni of the influential firm, one of whom worked for Soros. Several Trump Cabinet picks donated to his election effort, while his secretary of State choice led a mammoth American company with a global reach. Past presidents have put Wall Street figures and personal donors in their administrations, as well. But after a populist message of shifting power to the forgotten helped to fuel his improbable political rise, Trump seems entirely comfortable filling his administration with the wealthy and influential, money in politics experts said. ""You're playing with fire if you ride a wave of anger against the establishment and big-money politics and then practice big-money politics,"" said Daniel Weiner, senior counsel at the New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice. After Trump entered the presidential race last year, he said his wealth ensured that he did not need donors. He largely funded his own primary run before shifting to more traditional fundraising in the general election. Trump slammed former GOP opponent Sen. Ted Cruz and then Clinton for their ties to Goldman, using his populist pitch to try to win over disillusioned voters on the left who supported Wall Street critic Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the final election push, Trump pledged to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of big-money influence. Trump's transition team announced last month that it would not include lobbyists and said that members of the administration would be banned from lobbying for five years after they left the government, an effort to curb special interests in politics. Beyond the push against lobbying, though, Trump has signaled little desire to reduce the role of the wealthy and powerful, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""His focus on lobbyists means he's concerned about it, but he's defining it very narrowly. Insiders will arguably have more power in the next administration given the kind of powerful perch that they're being appointed to,"" she said. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this story. Trump has picked two chief executives of major U.S. companies, a former Goldman partner and a billionaire investor for his Cabinet. He has also chosen Goldman's former second-ranking executive, Gary Cohn, and Linda McMahon, a former WWE CEO who gave $6 million to a super PAC backing him, for non-Cabinet level spots. Cohn will head the National Economic Council, while McMahon was picked for the Small Business Administration. Current Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker donated to President Barack Obama, while George W. Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was the CEO of Goldman, so Trump isn't the first president to pick Wall Street veterans and donors for top spots. But Krumholz said Trump has chosen more wealthy people for his administration than presidents typically have in the past. Trump has defended his picks from the business world by saying they know how to create jobs and will help him follow through on his economic promises. Here is a list of Trump's Cabinet-level picks so far. It includes what they gave to him and outside groups backing him, according to Federal Election Commission records. Still, it remains to be seen how much the senators confirming Trump's picks and the voters who propelled him to the White House care about the wealth in his administration. While Democrats have signaled they could make confirmation difficult for some of the picks, particularly Tillerson, Mnuchin and Sessions, the Republican Senate majority will likely push them through barring a major upheaval within the party. Voters may not be concerned about the influential people in Trump's administration as long as he follows through on campaign promises to boost economic growth and promote job creation in the Rust Belt, said Steven Billet, director of the master's program in legislative affairs at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. Trump has promised that his tax reform and trade policies will boost American businesses and he has already celebrated a deal with United Technologies for it to keep some of the Carrier jobs it planned to move to Mexico. ""If he doesn't deliver the kind of jobs that are appealing to that slice of the American public that was so stridently supportive of his candidacy, then he's going to have a problem,"" Billet said. The Trump transition has recently faced influence issues outside of the appointments. On Tuesday, the transition team denied that Trump's two grown sons had ""any involvement"" with a reported charity event that sought donations of up to $1 million in exchange for packages that included a private reception with the president-elect. Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric serve on his transition team and the president-elect has said they will help to run his businesses after he takes office. A charitable auction for a meeting with Trump's daughter Ivanka was also recently canceled after questions were raised about the ethics of offering access. The proceeds were supposed to go to the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. Separately, early Trump supporter and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has started a consulting firm based only a block away from the White House to promote Trump's agenda.

67,Elizabeth Gurdus,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The U.S. has a pressing need to bolster its weak cybersecurity in the face of huge breaches like Russia's suspected sabotage of the election system and Yahoo's billion-user hack, Ret. Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

70,Michael Brush,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:46 a.m. ET Those with high deferred tax liabilities will be the real winners By Many investors are now hunting for companies that pay high U.S. taxes because they stand to benefit the most if Donald Trump cuts corporate taxes, as he said he would. But the real accounting sleuths are looking elsewhere for the hidden gems that may get the biggest boost. They’re digging up the companies that have the largest “deferred tax liabilities” on the books. If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

71,Michael K. Farr,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary,0.9998

From a geopolitical perspective, 2016 has been the most volatile year in recent history, with historic elections in Britain, Italy, and the U.S. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has ratcheted up anxieties, with the real-estate mogul recently saying that he planned to “greatly strengthen and expand” the country’s nuclear capability, raising the specter of a Cold War-era style arms race. However, observers may be hard pressed to discern any signs of the swiftly shifting political landscape in the equity markets. After a rocky start, trading this year was marked by a rally that has taken major indexes to repeated records, but despite the tilt higher Wall Street has mostly been marked by a historic level of quiescence.

According to LPL Financial, the average level for the “fear index” in 2016 was below 16, the fifth straight year it has averaged below 20, the level considered its long-term average. Readings below 12 suggests that the market isn’t betting on any sharp market swings. Despite that, investors are nearly unanimous that the events of the year have injected huge amounts of uncertainty into the economy. It is unknown what the fallout will be to the U.K.’s vote to exit from out of the European Union, known as Brexit, or the populist movements sweeping Europe. President-elect Donald Trump remains a wild card, as his tweets hint at potentially massive changes to U.S. policy on China, in addition to calling out companies and Wall Street executives. “The world economy and markets have embarked on a journey into the unknown,” researchers at Pimco wrote in a Dec. 15 note. The firm didn’t adjust its outlook for 2017, but wrote that “our confidence in any particular scenario is low. The reason: the world has now fully arrived in the radically uncertain, ‘stable but not secure’ predicament.” The most commonly invoked aphorism on Wall Street is “markets hate uncertainty.” So why hasn’t “a journey into the unknown” devolved into wild price swings? Some analysts believe that we might get that at some point—but not yet. Read:  Delayed reaction? Here’s when the latest terror attacks could rattle markets See also: How Trump and Brexit are shaking up investment portfolios for 2017 Perhaps the biggest question mark among geopolitical issue involves Russia. On Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by a Turkish police officer, raising tensions that had already been elevated due to the country’s alleged hacking during the U.S. campaign; Moscow has been charged with stealing and leaking emails in an effort to interfere with the election in favor of Trump. While top Senate Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for investigations into the issue, Trump has dismissed intelligence assessments of the hack, raising questions about the kind of response will be made by the government, if any. “These are really big wild cards. You hear guys like [Sen. Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell saying that no matter what Russia did, they’re not our friend. And then Trump comes out to say he’s a fan of Putin—that’s a huge chasm, and we don’t know what side anyone is on,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners, which manages $89 billion. U.S. intelligence and Homeland security accused Russia of directing a series of cyberattacks to influence the outcome of the presidential election. “If the election was tampered with, then there should be some kind of retaliation, which would fly in the face of both Trump and Tillerson, who is also very friendly with Putin. Those are significant curveballs, and all they do is add more uncertainty to the market,” said Mullaney.

who was recently named Trump’s secretary of state and has had business dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the uncertainty, equities have risen steadily since the election, with investors betting that the broad outlines of Trump’s expected economic policy proposals—which include massive corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and heavy infrastructure spending—will accelerate economic growth and spur inflation. “Markets have factored in the prospect of lower taxes. That’s the numerical rationale for these gains; it’s not just euphoria about a business-oriented president,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “We’re not that goofy, overall,” she said of market analysts. Read: Wall Street’s Trump optimism comes with heavy dose of uncertainty Trump has released few details about the policies he will pursue, making it difficult to evaluate their impact on the economy or corporate growth. Thus far, however, corporate optimism doesn’t seem to match the expectations conveyed by Wall Street’s rapid rise. Nick Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group, recently noted that 2017 revenue growth estimates for Dow components had fallen to 4.5% from the 4.8% that had been forecast before the election. “If history is any guide, they will be trimming it further,” he wrote of company analysts in a newsletter. “Moreover, our first look at 2018 revenue [comparisons] for the Dow shows analysts expect top line growth to decelerate further, to just 3.7% versus 2017.” Don’t miss: Stocks get Trump bounce, but not the real economy Even if fundamentals don’t show signs of weakening, however, the prospect of elevated tension with military rivals like Russia, or with major trading partners like China or Mexico—both of which Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on—could be enough to bring markets down. “If you look at headlines about our relationship with China getting choppy, or the degree to which we may become buddies with Russia, or about how Europe manages itself in this political age, then it’s easy to see why we expect volatility will come back into this market,” said Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim. “The current lack of concern seems to be that the dust will settle in a way that’s not too dissimilar from what we have now, but even if that’s true, the path to the dust settling is uncertain.” Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

73,,1052017,Reuters,12292016,"(This January 3 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company) By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices. Trump’s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector. And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits. But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers. But the industry’s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say. “I don’t see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,” said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm. The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income. Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade. “We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,” Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement. Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and “listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out.” Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar’s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict. “This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank. “Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They’ll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I’m unsympathetic,” he added. Height Securities’ Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: “Trump doesn’t want to have refineries closing on his watch.” Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose. For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans’ plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump’s plan, to 15 percent. Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments. Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate. ","

75,Mark Fahey,1052017,CNBC,12292016,"President-elect Donald Trump can influence stock prices and change corporate plans simply by tweeting, and few companies are as dependent on the government as the big contractors. About 61 entities earned $1 billion or more from federal contracts in the 2015 fiscal year, and 34 of those are publicly traded companies, according to data from the federal procurement data system. As you would expect, the biggest recipients are defense contractors, which already had good reason to watch Trump closely after he was involved in a deal to keep Carrier jobs in Indiana. Companies like Lockheed Martin may top the list at $36 billion in contractual obligations, but companies across several other industries are getting a huge amount of their revenue from the government, according to data from the federal system and FactSet. For the energy sector, Exxon Mobil is the biggest contractor with almost $800 million in petroleum contracts, mostly for the Defense Logistics Agency. That may seem like a lot, but it's a negligible fraction of the energy giant's revenue each year. The same is true for the telecom leader, AT&T, and shipping leader FedEx, which each made a little over $600 million from the government in 2015. The situation is completely different for the leading firm in information technology, SAIC, which depends on government contracts for 78 percent of its revenue. Private prisons firm GEO Group lead the real estate sector, making about 71 percent of its $1.8 billion in sales from government contracts. In health care, McKesson Corp. made over $8 billion, most of which came from its lucrative relationship with Veteran's Affairs. That's about 4 percent of the pharmaceutical distributor's revenue. For companies classified as financial firms, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest government contractor. But the company didn't earn that position through its financial businesses — most of its government revenue came from its nonfinancial holdings, including providing metals to the U.S. Mint, mobile homes for FEMA and flight training for the FAA, according to government data. Not counting state or local spending, the federal government paid almost $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015. Those are big sums, and those companies are going to be noticing everything Trump says. ",Top government contractors: 52 public companies that make the most,0.9771
76,Michael K. Farr,1052017,CNBC,12292016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering. The company’s IPO filing included a lengthy disclosure of its risks related to climate-change policies.

See also:  Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure It remains to be seen whether Clayton will take the SEC back to its lax enforcement days on the climate change disclosure issue or if he will carry his firm’s advice over to agency policy. At stake, writes Anderson, is the SEC’s interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure provided to companies in 2010, and the SEC’s related investigation into Exxon. The President-elect’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment on Clayton’s climate change disclosure support or relationship with Exxon.

78,Abigail Stevenson,1122017,CNBC,1052017,"While the market continues to focus on whether the Dow Jones industrial average will hit 20,000, Jim Cramer would rather look at how conceivable it is for the Dow to keep running after it does. Good news is that he does think it is possible. ""When you look at how far stocks would need to rally to get back to their all-time highs, you will find that many of these Dow names have been much higher in less fortuitous circumstances,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer boiled it down to 12 encouraging stocks that must advance more than 10 percent to get back to their old highs. No. 1 is Wal-Mart, which would need to climb 32 percent to get back to where it was two years ago. With the strength of Amazon, Cramer recognized that this is a lot to ask and said he doesn't expect it to help the Dow get to 20,000. No. 2 is American Express. The stock has 28 percent to run back to its 2014, and Cramer recommended buying it at current levels. All it would take is a multiple expansion now that the multiple is in favor. No. 3 was IBM, which would have to mount a 26 percent gain to get back to its $216 high in 2013. Unfortunately, Cramer didn't think IBM will get back to a 15 price-to-earnings multiple up from its current 12. ""In truth, IBM should never have been as high as $216. Its earnings were inflated by buybacks and the price was hyped by hoopla surrounding Warren Buffett's anointment of the stock,"" Cramer said. No. 4 was Nike, the most intriguing stock to Cramer. Nike would need its stock to advance 26 percent to reach old highs, and Cramer thinks if Donald Trump can lower the corporate tax rate, it could help move it higher. However, he wasn't confident that it can close the gap between $53 and $67. No. 5 was Caterpillar, which also told investors it's not doing that well. It also would be the most hurt if Trump starts to play hardball with China, but it would also be a large beneficiary to a domestic infrastructure program. Cramer was willing to bet that the stock can creep towards its old level on positive commodity data and cost cuts from Trump. No. 6 and 7 were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which need to add 17 percent to get back to their old highs, and Cramer won't count on them to get the Dow to 20,000. ""Frankly, that is just asking too much of these stocks,"" Cramer said. No. 8 was Coca-Cola, and with a new CEO coming in, Cramer was willing to bet that the restructuring designed by outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent means the company will meet its numbers. However, he says the stock cannot be relied on to rally 14 percent to its former glory. No. 9 was Apple, and Cramer thinks the stock is looking like it will break out soon. It must advance a little more than 13 percent, and Cramer is concerned that Apple hasn't augmented its service revenue stream and isn't using its massive cash hoard to make more acquisitions. No. 10 was Cisco, which is still reeling from a downbeat quarter. Cramer wants Cisco to find a way to make it clear that its legacy business isn't hurting it as it transitions to more of a cloud play. He wasn't confident that the stock can rally 13 percent to its recent high. No. 11 and 12 was Disney and United Technologies, which need to rally 12 and 10 percent respectively to get to all-time highs. Based on Disney's theme park attendance, movies and potential to be a beneficiary of a corporate tax cut, Cramer called this one an ""up"" stock United Technologies will have a tough time gaining traction because of its recent strong run. If anything, Cramer expects the numbers to come down. So, while Cramer only found a few stocks among the list that could get back to old highs, many of them reached such high levels in a worse environment. Perhaps they can do it again.

""We have to get our drug industry coming back. Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right,"" Trump said at his first news conference since winning the U.S. election. The Nasdaq composite fell after Trump made his remarks, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3 percent. The tech-heavy index, however, ended the session 0.2 percent higher at a record closing level. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent, shrugging off a 1 percent decline in health care. Energy stocks led the way in the S&P, rising 1.2 percent. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said the stock market has largely given Trump  the benefit of the doubt. He said that would change after the inauguration. ""After that point, his actions will become more important versus what he says,"" he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 99 points higher, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index briefly turned lower after Trump's remarks on the pharmaceutical industry. Investors came into the news conference looking for clues about his proposed policies. Stocks in the U.S. have rallied sharply since Trump's victory, amid hope that the incoming administration will cut corporate taxes, deregulate certain sectors and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Trump's news conference concluded without him providing details on these policies. ""We need some concrete numbers. We haven't sold off because there hasn't been a reason to do so. That said, you're dealing with some pretty nervous longs here,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Our hope is that these three policies will be enacted and a more pragmatic approach will be taken to trade and immigration,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. He also said he expects Trump to wait until the after the inauguration to provide more guidance on his policies. That said, some of the president-elect's tweets have raised concerns among investors. Since Nov. 8, Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize companies that planned to send jobs overseas rather than create them in the United States. He has also threatened to levy a high border tax against those firms. ""What's interesting about Trump is he's sort of managed to work around the traditional news cycle,"" said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. ""The market is also grappling with that, too."" ""Companies like Airbus and Boeing will not only have to think about their input cost, but they will also have to pay attention to (the) PR perspective,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Separately, Trump's nominee for secretary of State Rex Tillerson, testified on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearing. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has raised concerns among most of the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Marco Rubio, given his lack of public service experience and close ties to Russia. ""There's so much that could come out from those hearings,"" said Hartford Funds' Siomades. ""This cast of characters is not well known, and the market could react to that."" Wall Street also braced itself for the start of earnings season, as banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among others, are slated to report quarterly results on Friday. ""I think we're going to get a good earnings season,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. ""The question is can the market sustain the euphoria with what could still be considered relatively modest earnings growth."" In the bond market, meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys traded higher after Trump's news conference, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.365 percent and the two-year note yield holding near 1.18 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after trading higher, with the euro near $1.057 and the yen around 115.38. The pound briefly fell around 1 percent against the dollar, breaking below $1.21. Sterling last traded at $1.22. Overseas, European equities traded higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing 0.23 percent. In Asia, Chinese stocks closed lower overnight, with the Shanghai composite  dropping 0.79 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225  recorded a gain of 0.33 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 19,954.28, with Merck leading advancers and Pfizer  lagging. The S&P 500 rose 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at 2,275.32, with energy leading eight sectors higher and health care the top decliner. The Nasdaq composite advanced 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 5,563.65. About two stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 878.84 million and a composite volume of 3.563 billion at the close.

The election of Donald Trump has many wondering whether the renewable energy industry will continue to flourish in the United States. Much to FuelCell Energy's (NASDAQ:FCEL) delight, though, there are several signs suggesting that America's neighbors to the north have no intention of slowing down. Though it's uncertain how advantageous this is for FuelCell Energy, it does represent some interesting opportunities -- opportunities that could possibly translate to ever-elusive profits. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. There's certainly been no shortage of talk about pipelines extending from Canada recently. Stealing some of the headlines from the Dakota Access Pipeline, another familiar name -- Keystone XL -- has been reappearing since Donald Trump revealed his support of the pipeline to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Both leaders' apparent enthusiasm for activity in the oil sands bodes well for FuelCell Energy, which recently revealed its participation in related studies. Partnering with Alberta Innovates, FuelCell Energy will conduct an engineering study for a fuel-cell carbon capture application at a heavy oil refinery near Saskatchewan. According to FuelCell Energy's press release, ""A second potential site, the Scotford bitumen upgrading facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, will also be evaluated as part of the engineering study."" Operated by Royal Dutch Shell, the facility is part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project -- site of the first commercial application of carbon capture and storage in the oil sands industry. FuelCell Energy also revealed in its press release that should the study prove that the application is a success, it could lead to ""a megawatt-scale fuel cell carbon application at an existing gas-fired plant."" It's not just the oil sands that represent an opportunity for FuelCell Energy, but coal power as well. The Canadian government recently announced its plan to phase out traditional coal-power plants by 2030. In working toward that goal, the government will work with four provinces to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-power plants. Canada's commitment could benefit FuelCell Energy, as the company began a partnership with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) last spring on developing technology for carbon capture through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. A 2.8 MW DFC3000 fuel-cell power plant. Image source: FuelCell Energy corporate website. Addressing the benefits of this application, Chip Bottone, FuelCell Energy's president and CEO, recognized that, ""Carbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants."" Testing the fuel cell carbon capture technology with its DFC3000 fuel-cell power system at a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal- and gas-fired power plant in Alabama, the company estimates that the DFC3000 fuel-cell power system reduces approximately 70% of a plant's smog-producing pollutants like nitrogen oxides and remove 90% of carbon from the exhaust stream. Between the oil sands and transition from coal power, Canada's opportunities may very well be sources of revenue for FuelCellEnergy in the years to come. Unfortunately, those years are considerably down the line, and the company has much more pressing issues to contend with right now -- so much so that it may never get to realize those opportunities in the Great White North. Updating investors in December, management reported that it was ""reducing materials spend as well as implementing various cost control initiatives"" in order to achieve its long-term goals. The company, for example, reduced its global workforce by 17% as well as implementing other measures in order to reduce its operating expenses by $6 million on an annualized basis. This would translate to an approximate reduction of 14% based on the $42 million that the company reported in fiscal 2015. Further illustrating the company's precarious position, management noted it was forecasting revenue to fall to a range of $107 million to $109 million for fiscal 2016 -- a far cry from the range of $170 million to $210 million that it had forecast on the Q4 conference call in 2015. No longer a contender for the Beacon Falls Energy Park -- worth a potential $500 million between equipment and service over its life, according to management -- FuelCell Energy is relying on the more than $400 million it has in contracted backlog as of Oct. 31, 2016 to keep the lights on. Any opportunities in Canada that inspire hopes of profits must be tempered by the reality that the company is still struggling to prove the advantages of its fuel-cell solutions to customers.

Investors haven't been happy with IBM (NYSE:IBM) lately. Since Ginni Rometty started as CEO in January of 2012, IBM has seen 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year declining revenue -- essentially every quarter of her tenure. The stock has lost nearly 10% compared to a gain of 78% for the S&P 500 over the last five years. IBM 5 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. For IBM shareholders, Ginni Rometty's four-year reign as chief executive officer hasn't been anything to go to Disneyland about. But her company has become a leader in one corporate category: board members willing to shovel incentive pay at a CEO turning in a mediocre performance. With all the negative sentiment and equally dismal stock performance, should investors have any hope that IBM will right the ship? IBM believes it can, and it's betting the future on Watson. You may recall how Ken Jennings, famous for his 74 consecutive wins on Jeopardy, was dethroned by Watson, the IBM supercomputer. Why would a company risk so much on a game-playing computer? The key is not in the computer as much as in the science behind it. IBM's Watson beats 74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings.  Image source: Flickr user edwardhblake. Watson is a system based on artificial intelligence (AI). Computer simulations of the human brain, called neural networks, mimic humans' capacity to learn. Using massive amounts of data and complex algorithms, an AI system gradually learns to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. It is taught to recognize patterns within massive amounts of data. IBM has been betting heavily on Watson by leveraging its AI platform and data analytics for a variety of business applications. The company's CEO has said that, in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of Watson. Several recent high-profile partnerships illustrate how IBM has been approaching this goal, and the strategy appears to be gaining steam. UA Record smartphone app powers Healthbox.     Image source: Under Armour. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) announced a strategic partnership with IBM to leverage the 190 million registered users of its Connected Fitness platform and Watson's deep-learning technology. The system would provide users with individual health and fitness insights backed by data. It is intended to act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer, and assistant. This collaboration underpins the HealthBox, Under Armour's connected fitness system, which combines a fitness band, digital scale, heart-rate monitor, and the UA Record smartphone app. It will track sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, and training information, and provide personalized recommendations. This is a valuable project for IBM since Watson learns with each infusion of data. The partnership is a win for Under Armour as well, and is part of a bigger play. Its acquisition of three fitness app companies that now comprise its Connected Fitness platform, the release of Healthbox, and the integration of Watson provides Under Armour with an end-to-end health and fitness solution that connects to its users in a very real way. This will likely drive future adoption and boost customer satisfaction. OnStar Go powered by Watson. Image source: General Motors Company. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) partnered with IBM to pair its OnStar vehicle-communication system with Watson's learning capabilities to create OnStar Go, a cognitive mobility platform. According to the press release, the new platform's numerous benefits include helping drivers avoid traffic, giving them the ability to order coffee on the go, making restaurant recommendations, and reminding users to pick up diapers and formula on the way home. Drivers will have to consent, and Watson will recognize their preferences and patterns in their decisions and habits. This will also develop individualized and location-based marketing. The partnership will present other business opportunities. OnStar has already signed iHeartRadio, which will provide personalized musical experiences, and MasterCard, which will allow consumers to pay for gas and other services from their car. Other partners include ExxonMobil, Glympse, and Parkopedia. iOS enterprise developers get access to Watson. Image source: IBM. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM's partnership was first announced over two years ago but has evolved in the meantime. Initially, the pair planned the development of over 100 enterprise apps for a variety of industries, including retail, healthcare, banking, transportation, and insurance. According to a recent announcement, enterprise iOS users will have in-app access to Watson, opening the door to deep-learning technology for these made-for-business apps. iOS app developers will be able to use Watson's AI as a platform for their own apps. Apple has already benefited from the partnership by gaining inroads into enterprise. IBM announced last year that it had begun to replace its PCs with Apple Mac computers. Employees were given the option to make the switch and 73% chose Mac. In a presentation at Jamf Nation User Conference, a gathering of Mac system administrators, IBM told attendees that PCs were three times more expensive to manage, Macs had a lower total cost of ownership, and that the Mac was the standard at IBM Japan -- PCs were the exception. These recent developments will provide greater validation to Apple's prospective enterprise customers while advancing the company's AI agenda. Apple has an installed base of over 1 billion active iOS devices with a growing percentage of those in enterprise. This, combined with Watson's ability to learn from streams of data, will provide both companies with a stronger relative position from which to compete. These collaborations are merely the most high-profile examples of hundreds going on behind the scenes. IBM tweeted earlier this year that more than 500 partners and 80,000 developers were building products and apps powered by Watson. The installed base that comes with the partnerships is growing, and should eventually show up in IBM's revenue and provide vindication for the company's Watson-centric strategy. IBM expects Watson to contribute $1 billion in revenue by 2018, and $10 billion by 2023, though it doesn't currently break out that contribution. Strategic Initiatives, where Watson's revenue resides was $8 billion in the most recent quarter, of $19 billion total revenue for IBM. It's a relatively small slice for IBM now, but it's clear the company expects to build AI into a major pillar of its business in the next few years. If it works, it might just reverse fortunes for the flailing big tech company.  ","

The memos also highlight the legal consequences companies like Exxon and Peabody Energy

                                   have faced when they fail to do so. In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering. The company’s IPO filing included a lengthy disclosure of its risks related to climate-change policies. Sullivan & Cromwell is also an associate member of the Chicago Climate Exchange, a division of ICE

It was first major international law firm to join, according to a press release. “We are committed,” said Sullivan & Cromwell chairman H. Rodgin Cohen at the time, “to being a socially responsible member of all the communities in which we practice.” The memos also remind clients state attorneys general like Schneiderman and California’s Governor Jerry Brown have vowed to continue with their efforts to hold fossil fuel and utility interests accountable on climate change, even if the Trump SEC drops the issue. See also:  Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure It remains to be seen whether Clayton will take the SEC back to its lax enforcement days on the climate change disclosure issue or if he will carry his firm’s advice over to agency policy. At stake, writes Anderson, is the SEC’s interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure provided to companies in 2010, and the SEC’s related investigation into Exxon. The President-elect’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment on Clayton’s climate change disclosure support or relationship with Exxon.

83,Jack Hough,1122017,MarketWatch,1052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

                                   launched in 2011. “But investors are stepping on the gas with valuations high. If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016). Since then, the iShares Russell 1000 Value exchange-traded fund

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

The fund lagged behind the S&P 500 in both 2014 and 2015 but trounced it last year, and is now ahead by two percentage points a year on average over the past five years. The GoodHaven fund is managed by a pair of alumni from the Fairholme fund, which is known for concentrated positions and spectacular periods of over- and underperformance, mostly the former. This has added up to long-term returns well ahead of the market, but also plenty of discomfort along the way. Launched in 2011, GoodHaven, too, is keeping things interesting. Last year, it beat the S&P 500 by eight percentage points. The year before it trailed by 20.

84,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"The deal, Exxon’s biggest since its 2009 buyout of XTO Energy, is the latest by oil producers across the Permian since last summer, with technological improvements and rangebound oil prices fueling the buyouts. Exxon is exchanging an initial $5.6 billion in stock for leases covering roughly 275,000 acres from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Additional payments of up to $1 billion will start in 2020, depending on how the acreage performs, Exxon said in a statement. Most of the wells to be drilled on the land should provide “attractive returns” with oil prices CLc1 at or above $40 per barrel, Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said. Much of the Permian’s oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more. About 250,000 acres is on three large parcels in the Permian, and the rest is on oil fields in Colorado and Louisiana. The Permian land, which Exxon estimates holds 3.4 billion barrels of oil retrievable with current technology, produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), most of which is crude. Most of the acreage is held by production, meaning Exxon will not have to rush to add new wells to honor lease contracts. Exxon pumps about 140,000 boepd from its current Permian holdings of roughly 1.5 million acres. The company operates 10 drilling rigs in the Permian and said it will boost that to 25 to develop the new acreage, though no timetable has been set. The deal is the first major move by Chief Executive Darren Woods since he took over from Rex Tillerson, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be U.S. secretary of state. Exxon plans to run the acreage through its XTO subsidiary, which operates elsewhere in Texas and North Dakota. Exxon’s shares were up about 0.6 percent in midday trading. ","

85,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

The 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 2 and the 25,000 bpd Hydrocracking Unit 1 will be shut along with other units during the overhaul, the sources said. FCCU 2 is the smaller of two cat crackers at the refinery. The 125,000 bpd FCCU 1 will remain in operation during the work. HCU 1 is the only hydrocracker at the refinery. A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high pressure to produce motor fuels, primarily diesel from gas oil. The Baytown refinery is the second largest in the United States and Exxon’s largest U.S. refinery. ","

87,Tom DiChristopher,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"The world's biggest publicly traded energy company is joining the land rush in the prolific Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil announced Tuesday it will pay $5.6 billion in stock to acquire companies owned by Texas' Bass family that control parts of the Permian in New Mexico. The purchase roughly doubles Exxon's holdings in the basin, adding acreage with an estimated 3.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The assets are located in the Delaware Basin, part of the larger Permian. The deal is the largest oil and gas acquisition in the United States since crude prices crashed in November 2014, according to Houston-based oil and gas research firm PLS. It tops the previous record-setting $4.4 billion purchase of Memorial Resources by Range Resources in May. ""This acquisition strengthens Exxon Mobil's significant presence in the dominant U.S. growth area for onshore oil production,"" Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren W. Woods said in a statement. ""This investment gives us an exceptional Delaware Basin position ... that can generate attractive returns in a low-price environment."" Shares of Exxon were up modestly Tuesday. The Delaware Basin has lately boasted eye-popping land prices. Deals there made up the bulk of last year's $69 billion in U.S. energy mergers and acquisitions. Permian acreage is a prized because the basin's geology allows drillers to produce oil at very low prices and profit from the operations even as a severe crude price downturn extends into a third year. The adjusted per-acre price for Exxon's purchase comes in at about $20,000, ""a very good number for New Mexico,"" said Andrew Dittmar, mergers and acquisitions analyst at PLS. Exxon will pay the Basses, a prominent Forth Worth energy family, up to $1 billion in cash contingent on the land's production. The deal marks the second recent purchase of Delaware Basin assets controlled by a storied energy family. In September, EOG Resources bought Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion. The Yates family's history in American oil stretches back about a century. EOG paid about $9,000 per acre in that deal, which was also centered on New Mexico's Lea and Eddy counties, PLS data shows. Exxon's deal also comes just one day after Noble Energy paid $3.2 billion, including debt, to buy Clayton Williams Energy. That acquisition focused on assets in the southern Delaware Basin in Texas, at a price of $33,000 per acre, according to PLS.

88,Fred Imbert,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Thursday, with real estate falling around 1 percent, as investors eagerly awaited President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. ""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued. Bank of New York Mellon and Union Pacific were among the companies reporting before the bell, with Dow components IBM and American Express set to report after the close.

89, ,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"Following are excerpts from a CNBC interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, from the World Economic Forum 2017 with Steve Sedgwick SS: Patrick great to see you again. Look the world is seemingly a different place 12 months on, the oil price has pretty much doubled. Does that make your job a lot easier? PP: For sure it is easier at 55 dollar then 28 dollar.  . I don't know if the word is easier. I begin to believe that the oil price is maybe a leading indicator of the mood of the world. But you know when you compare the situation one year ago, price collapse to 28 dollar a barrel, and the atmosphere in Davos was not very optimistic. This year is 55 but I remind you two years ago it was 100. So still some gap to do. People are more positive. And at the same time the status of the world did not improve a lot you know, in the one year many events in the Middle East, Brexit, many difficulties appear around the world so, but people are more positive. SS: Well that's interesting because we've seen the markets recover, we've seen the oil price recover and yet we've seen a whole host of quite damning political events for many in 2016 as well. But you think despite those political events the world is actually a more positive place and perhaps a safer place? PP: Safer, no. Not safer. There are many uncertainties. I would say what characterize the world for me today is a lot of uncertainty which is not good for business. There is an economist who was saying at the beginning of the century you have a difference between risks and uncertainty, risk you can manage, you can quantify risks. Uncertainty you don't know. And today what I face is many uncertainty- we are waiting to see what the foreign policy of Donald Trump will be, clearly Brexit and there is huge uncertainty over the future of Europe and how you deal with such a country outside of the European union, plus of course in the Middle East Iran is back because of the agreement last year- it involved many difficulties around. So there is much uncertainty. SS: All right, well you've mentioned three very important areas as well- Mr. Trump, Iran and Europe's cohesion. Let's start off with Mr. Trump as well. How's it going to be for you, do you think actually he's going to change the way that oil companies are going to do business in the US and elsewhere, do you think there's going to be any meteoric changes at all? PP:I think clearly, on energy, there are plenty of specialist of energy in this government, he has strong feeling that energy is one of the advantage of the U.S. economy already today in fact. So he's willing to not put too much regulations in order to help the investment in energy so it's good for energy companies, at least for oil and gas companies, so it's positive I think from these companies' point of view. We'll see then what he will do exactly- because you know there is a difference between what you say and when you are in power. We will see. SS: You say oil and gas companies, the oil companies are becoming more and more gas and oil companies and so the push to cleaner hydrocarbons, to renewables as well, the big investments that you at Total have been in making in green energy, in solar, in storage as well. Do you think a lot of that is actually going to be more difficult to carry on with large levels of investment because of Mr. Trump? PP: Not for gas, you know gas is one the big advantage of the U.S. economy, the shale gas revolution is at the heart of this rejuvenation of the US manufacturing industry, it is energy which is at the core of the capacity of the US to grow their manufacturing industry, to develop jobs. By the way we have invested in gas in the US this year, we have extended our position in Texas, in the Barnett. We just announced a deal with a (company name not clear) a gas company that wants to export energy. So for me US gas is working well. Renewables, we are also shown some progress- I suspect maybe the fiscal incentives which have been planned for renewables maybe will diminish but we will see. SS: That's quite damning in what is arguably the world's largest consumer of energy. PP: Yeah but OK in the meantime renewables have made progress so again it's a matter- I think there will be some debate between the congress, the President so we will see what the outcome will be of all that. But I'm positive, I think the U.S. economy is already strong. So I don't know if Mr. Trump will be able to do it stronger but it seems that it is his vision but we will see what he is doing exactly. SS: It's  no secret that Exxon Mobil and Total, and Total backed by a lot of other companies have a difference of opinion of a way to approach climate change and approach sustainability and what the remedy might be for oil and gas companies. How do you think Rex Tillerson might be as Secretary of State and what does it mean do you think for relations with other players including Russia? PP: There are many questions there. Climate change, Russia you know. I think first, I think the testimony from Rex Tillerson was quite clear- he believes in climate change, then there is the question of what is the strategy of Exxon now that he is no longer in charge. The difference was more between Exxon and Total: Should we involve the company in this green energy business to prepare for the future, that is a strategy decision, we believe that it is a matter of market, not just climate change, if we want to find new growth we can continue in oil and gas but at a certain point demand could peak so we prefer to prepare for the future and invest some of our money in renewable energy storage. Having said that, in twenty years we still remain an oil and gas company. But having also a foot in renewables. SS: And the second point, Mr. Tillerson knows Russia very well, you know Russia very well. There seems to be from Mr. Trump language of a rapprochement with Mr. Putin as well. Do you think it can benefit Total and the whole oil and gas industry? PP: It's not only the oil and gas industry, it's more a matter of world stability. Clearly Russia is a big player, by the way each time you have a new U.S. President- George W. Bush, Barack Obama, now Mr. Trump, first year they all began to engage in a positive dialogue with Russia. We will see if it happens. I hope so, because frankly we cannot have a [inaudible] it's important for Europe too to find a way to stabilize all of that. It's not so easy because the U.S. also like to have a big problem [inaudible]  in front of them. But of course I am an investor in Russia so if it is more stable it is better for me but I think also it is better for the world. SS: if the US is looking for closer relations with Russia. There is concern that it actually doesn't want to continue closer relations with Iran as well. You've made investments looking at developing South Pars as well. Do you fear for those investments? I spoke to one of your peers a while back who said he was concerned about investing in Iran precisely because of what sanctions could come from the U.S. PP: Let's be clear about Iran. There is a sanctions system existing in the U.S. we have to obey to that. There is no way for Total, or any other company, to escape from that. Having said that, and I've been very transparent with the Obama administration about all the moves- we made them aware of what we were doing, we respect what we have singed, we respect the agreements, if the sanctions framework is changing we will have to adapt ourselves. So I will just observe what will be done by the Trump administration about Iran. But you know it is a world where you cannot have many enemies- China, Russia, Iran you have to select things. So we will work and again it is an opportunity for us- you know for Total if you are an oil and gas company you have to go to where there is oil and gas- there is oil and gas in Russia, there is oil and gas in Iran. Having said that I'm perfectly aware there are some risks, it is a matter then of what is the size of the risk compared to the size of the company, and investing 1 or 2 billion in Iran when we have 150bn USD of assets is not a big risk and it could be a big reward for our shareholders. SS: Where is the biggest risk for Total in 2017? PP: The biggest risk? Again, for me it is more the uncertainty internationally, it's very difficult today to tell you what will happen and I suspect it will take some months.   Because I suspect that it's not only if President Trump came to office next Friday, you still have the full administration to put in place before we understand the full policies so it will take time. We are entering into 6 months, 9 months of uncertainty and it's not good for business because what business wants is predictability you know, if you are to invest, if you want to take decisions in energy you invest for 20 years, you need to have clear frameworks so that is the main risk for us. SS: Are you getting a clear framework from Europe as well? We mentioned Brexit, we mentioned the concerns about cohesion within the EU as well. France has got a very big election which is already dividing the population as well, you have of course have had some political experience as well. What do you think about Europe in 2017? Are you worried that we're going to see more of the same that we saw of Renzi and Brexit? PP: I hope no. But I think that clearly for the European leaders it will be a very important year. we'll have new leadership coming; elections in France, in Germany, in the Netherlands and I think clearly, by the way, the position of Mr. Trump is provocative vis a vis Europe but maybe we need to be provocative and I hope for the leaders in Europe, we wake up and we build again the project. Clearly we have a problem today. We have a problem of leadership by the way. It's a question of leadership. We need leaders. I hope the new leaders in Europe will be able to offer a vision to European citizens in order to move the project forward. SS: Don't we have a leader in Europe, don't we have Frau Merkel? PP: Well yes [inaudible] Merkel but maybe we will have the next French President as well SS: ...isnt that your former boss Mr. Fillon. Total: Yeah. And I think he can be a leader for Europe. But again, it's not a choice for me, let me be very clear. I am chairman and CEO of Total, I make no politics in that. As I have said in France, I vote for Total, which is more important for me. SS: Tell us a bit more about Total in 2017 as well. Do you feel slightly less pressure though because of this oil price move, because actually you're renewables division I think from the latest numbers actually some of the profits coming from that as well. It's looking better as well. Do you feel less pressure in 2017 than perhaps at any stage in the last couple of years? Total: For sure, but we have less pressure because we've made huge efforts. All the teams of Total worked hard. We have lowered our break even under 50 dollars per barrel and in terms of cash break even with a profit of sales we're now under 40 dollars a barrel so yes we made big efforts and so over the last two years where we had a lot of CapEx because we had lots of projects or projects to be delivered, we have no higher production and or financials banking [inaudible] strong. So for me 2017 is a new era. We were under pressure. Now we can be more offensive. We have, I would say, a very good status in the company. And our objective is to benefit from still a low price because there is low cost so we want to sanction projects and we want to make new deals to have access to resources like the one we have done in Brazil in December and in Uganda with Turo [inaudible]. So Total has gone through these difficult two years in good shape. And I'm very happy now we can be more offensive. SS: Are you calling time on CapEx cuts? PP: No, no, we have what we announce is that we will spend between 15 and 17 billion dollars of CapEx from 2017. I explained to investors it is a sustainable level of CapEx, with that we will be able to continue to grow the company larger more than the market services, or target that [inaudible]. This is what we want to do. So it's not a CapExs it is landing the CapEx to the sustainable level, which is more important. SS: And in terms of the renewable side of things: You and I were in a debate in Davos talking about the transition, the energy transition, the clean energy transition as well. And there was lot of concern from Christiana Figueres about the speed of transition. Are you happy with Total's investment in renewables. Is it just right?  You mentioned 15 to 17 billion dollars.I think your investments, I mean various figures, 500 million dollars a year is the figure that it's often cited? PP: Yeah. Let's be realistic, energy is a very important matter. I mean we are in the core of the energy, we have invested in renewables we are investing and I believe when we develop a strategy because again we want to remain a major company in the energy field. Renewables we love something.  But today, if I only had renewables Total would be unable to distribute any dividends. It's still an infant industry but we need to work on it. So accelerating is tough because as we were discussing in Davos, people want not only clean energy, people want reliable energy, people want cheap energy, so we have to be pragmatic. SS: Is that the priority with people reliable and cheap, reliable and cheap ahead of clean? PP I think I suspect yes because its energy is at the core of the development, economic development and when you go to India, when you go to China you think people, of course they want clean, to be able to have clean air but they want also to have access to energy which is more important for many people in the world. So I don't think, so I think yes an energy mix will evolve. You will have less coal, less oil, more gas. More renewables but it takes time. This transition is not because you decide. It's not, there is no magic tool there. It's just a matter of investments and words [inaudible]  that people need are serious and pragmatic strategies to prepare the future. So I hear [inaudible]  acceleration I suspect we have to be pragmatic and realistic but again it's a serious matter. SS: There's another great point raised and it's by Oleg  Deripaska of Rusal that he thought that some countries and I'll paraphrase in some countries are pretty hypocritical really they're using renewables as cover for increasing coal production and coal usage as well. Do you think there's a great degree of hypocrisy out there from some companies and perhaps some countries especially. PP: No I don't think, I mean medically I don't think there is some hypocrisy but what Mr. Deripaska pointed is right. What I observe in many countries, because they have a lot of coal, coal is burnt out in China, is burnt out in India, in the US as well, is that and it's cheap to produce coal, much cheaper than gas because gas is complex, you need to liquify it and you need to transport it so what I observe is that you have many countries which try to be genuinely like India, on the road map of two degrees. We have this national production of coal and they invest in solar and wind. One hundred seventy five gigawatts by 2022. And I think the Prime Minister Modi is very dedicated to that. But yes we see a mix of coal and renewables. It's a strange mix but I observe this trend in Germany, I observe this trend in Japan. Japan wants to decrease gas and increase coal with renewables. So there's something there and I think it is one of the for me the main concern about the climate change debate because frankly if we are unable to lower the coal share in the mix, there is no chance we can reach the two degree road map [inaudible] and that requires you to pricing. SS: We need the carbon pricing. Finally, there's a lot of inequality concerns. There's a lot of concerns about the haves and have nots and if Davos is anything it's a lot of haves, it's a very rich concentration of very wealthy and influential people. Do you think the Davos bubble the Davos echo chamber actually gets the message that there's some real problems out there and they need resolving very quick. PP: Yeah you're right. Clearly we are in a bubble and we are in part of the bubble. And Total, when you speak about globalization is one of the winners of this globalisation. We have been able to develop a company. I think what is important to know is that yes we discussed about what is happening around us. I'm not sure we fully understand but there is really a willingness and we have been proposed by Davos to sign a compact about responsible leadership. Responsible leadership for me it's very important. I think big companies like us it's not only a matter to distribute salaries to employees, dividends, social orders, taxes to states. It's not enough. By listening to all of these moves but we need to bring something else to the territories from which we work. You know we have the global company for us for example in France first. Then we moved out. We are moving because we are a global company because the cost of labour is lower in other countries. But if we stay, if we leave the territories behind us without taking care, I think we are making a mistake. Normally the states should take care of that but the states are unable and so it's back to what is the responsibility of a global corporation like Total and I think there is a fourth dimension, salaries, dividends, taxes plus something which is to take care also of our own territories. And I think we need to move on that and not only to think it's a matter for all of us. It's not a problem of all of us. It's our problems because I strongly believe globalisation is a good thing for the world. We have major poverty in the world. We have plenty of emerging countries. But all population in all developed countries seem to disagree so why they disagree because they are afraid so we need to answer them. And it's not only a politician story, it's also a matter for the leaders of large corporations like Total. I don't have the magic tool there again but I am convinced that we need to do that and to tell the people we were discussing these type of matters amongst the leaders of the world in Davos so it's not only we are yes, it's a bubble but this bubble is asking itself some questions. And it's important. ","Interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total from the World Economic Forum 2017",0.9998

Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

91,Dan Caplinger,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","

Wall Street trading over the past several days has been subdued as investors await signs that the stock-market rally that followed President-elect Donald Trump’s November election victory, supported by his campaign promises to increase fiscal spending, cut taxes and roll back regulations, is based in reality and underpinned by solid corporate quarterly results. Mike Antonelli, an equity sales trader at R.W. Baird & Co., said global stocks would likely remain placid until investors have a better picture of the fourth-quarter earnings environment and companies’ outlooks for 2017, as well as Trump’s plans. Trump will be sworn in to office on Friday. The bulk of S&P 500 firms will release their earnings in the coming weeks. Retail shares have been in focus in recent weeks, suffering on reports of tepid holiday sales. On Wednesday that trend continued, with Target Corp.

That news sparked a selloff that spread throughout the sector. “The story coming out of retail hasn’t been good,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Asset Management, adding that “individual stories” will likely continue to influence the broader sector. On Wednesday, the dollar recovered from Trump’s comments on Tuesday, who said a strong dollar can harm the U.S. economy.

The index fell 0.9% Tuesday, but added to its rebound after Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said she expects rate hikes a few times a year until the end of 2019. Read: Trump is waving adios to the longstanding ‘strong-dollar policy’ Economic docket: On the economic front, the consumer-price index, a widely watched gauge of inflationary pressure, showed price growth accelerated in 2016 at the fastest pace since 2011. In December, the index rose 0.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 0.2%. The reading was in line with investor expectations and had little impact on stock futures. U.S. industrial output accelerated last month at its strongest pace in two years. The housing-market index from the National Association of Homebuilders showed that builder sentiment slipped in January after notching its highest reading of the business cycle in December. Despite the drop, the January number was the second-highest reading of the cycle. Inflation appears to be heating up, according to the Federal Reserve’s so-called Beige Book, which found that eight out of 12 Fed districts saw modest price increases. Underscoring retail woes, the report said that retailers struggled to raise prices. Read:  How long postelection rallies last after Inauguration Day—in one chart Stock movers: Mallinckrodt PLC

93,,1262017,Reuters,1192017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

Investors will not only be looking at how the company performed in 2016, but will also be eager to get a sense of the company’s investment plans for 2017. Oil companies have aggressively scaled back capital expenditures since the oil price downturn in 2014. The chart below shows capital expenditure for ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP), which collectively fell by 47.3% from 2013 to 3Q-2016. This has left some industry experts wondering if spending reductions have gone too far. For example, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih has warned that there could by a global oil shortage as soon as 2020 if investment flows continue to be scaled back. In an investor presentation in November 2016 posted on Chevron’s website, the company says it plans to reduce capital and exploratory spending again in 2017 by about 25% from planned 2016 spending. Friday’s results should provide an update into whether these spending cuts are being accelerated or scaled back in a rising oil price environment. Some companies are already boosting investment spending. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China's largest offshore oil explorer, CNOOC (CEO), is planning to increase investment spending in 2017 between 19% and 39% for the first time since 2014. The marginal spending increase is equivalent to approximately $8.7 to $10.2 billion, or equal to roughly half of Chevron’s entire 2017 budgeted capital spending. 2017 will likely be a pivotal year for the oil industry. Those companies increasing investment spending could benefit if oil prices continue their upward path. A renewed downturn in prices, however, could see those who increased spending nursing large losses. On the other hand, companies that are scaling back investments could see their long term competitiveness eroded, especially if the oil shortage predicted by Saudi energy minister comes to pass.

96,Patti Domm,1262017,CNBC,1192017,"President Donald Trump could lift sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine by himself — and may justify doing so by saying that he is putting America first. Trump is expected to discuss the sanctions when he speaks by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview Friday. The White House also announced that Trump has separate calls with the leaders of Germany and France, two U.S. NATO allies that support sanctions on Russia. ""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said regarding Russia sanctions at a press conference on Friday. ""As far as the sanctions, it's very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally."" The U.S. sanctions, imposed through executive order by President Barack Obama, can be lifted by Trump's pen — without the vote of Congress — if he so wishes, experts said. It's not clear whether his intention is to lift sanctions right away, but Trump's first official discussion with Putin could lay the groundwork for removal. ""People said Trump will never remove the sanctions on Russia. Of course he will. It's a leveling of the playing field for U.S. corporations,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities research at RBC. The sanctions against Russia hurt that country's energy industry and make it harder for Russia to raise capital. Getting rid of the sanctions is a major priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. companies, including Exxon Mobil, were forced to drop activities in Russia if they were in new areas of development, such as Arctic drilling and Russian shale. But Croft explained that European companies, under separate European Union sanctions, were allowed to continue work on existing projects while being barred only from new ones. Based on Trump's rapid-fire execution of orders in his first week, such as directing the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, experts say it's possible he could move toward lifting sanctions against Russia. He could do so without the consent of European allies, which have sanctioned Russia separately. ""Clearly, he really wants this relationship to work. I have some sympathy in the sense the U.S. relationship with Russia has been very badly damaged, and a lot of that has Obama to blame,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of global political consultancy Eurasia Group. Trump has been moving toward lifting the sanctions already. ""He has so many of his speaking points aligned with those of the Kremlin, around Crimea, Ukraine, around Syria, around American exceptionalism and values,"" Bremmer said. Trump also seems bent to to move forward without gaining agreement from historic allies in Europe. ""If I were advising Trump, I would want him to be coordinating with Merkel and others who were steadfast allies ... I think he's made up his mind on this,"" said Bremmer. ""I guess what we've been learning about Trump is that he actually does what he said he was going to do. The problem is the sanctions were imposed for what the Russians did in Ukraine and Crimea. The Germans have worked hard to keep this together, as the French president has,"" said Professor Angela Stent, director Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. ""This would send a message to Russia that it can get away with it, but it undermines the European Union's efforts to hold Russia accountable."" Obama first imposed sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea, claiming it to be part of Russia. ""It's the Europeans who did it much later when the (Malaysian) airline was shot down over Ukraine,"" Stent said. Bremmer expects Trump to move forward regardless of prevailing sentiment Europe, where nationalist candidates stand to gain ground in several elections this year. In France, Marine Le Pen has gained in polls. She says she wants to get rid of the euro currency. ""Germany is the country that's in the most vulnerable position because of Trump, compared to most of the American allies. Europe is getting weaker. He likes Brexit, says other countries should leave. Germany is the country most interested in maintaining a strong Europe, and Trump is undermining (Merkel). Trump is renouncing American exceptionalism, in not telling other countries what to do,"" said Bremmer. At the same press conference where Trump spoke on Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May was forthright in saying that sanctions against Russia should continue until Russia conforms agreements designed to reduce fighting in Ukraine. Bremmer believes Trump will move forward quickly. But other experts say Trump may ease sanctions slowly — and therefore less visibly — rather than tossing them out right after taking office. Critics have called out Trump for praising Vladimir Putin, whom U.S. intelligence concluded was personally involved in trying to undermine last year's U.S. presidential election and help get Trump elected. Rex Tillerson, Trump's candidate for Secretary of State who just retired as CEO of ExxonMobil, and has strong personal links to Moscow and his former company has billions at stake in Russia. Trump initially refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russian officials intentionally meddled in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic National Committee computers. Trump has since vowed to make the U.S. more secure from cyber espionage, but has said nothing about punishing Russia. There is also another consideration. Tillerson has yet to be approved by the Senate. Tillerson was questioned by Congress on his feelings about Russia. One strategist said Trump may not lift sanctions right away because of the Tillerson vote, expected next week. Exxon has one of the most high-profile projects that was disrupted by sanctions, an Arctic drilling deal with Rosneft. The joint venture with Russian state-controlled oil giant was to explore and produce fossil fuels in Arctic waters, and it represents a big part of Exxon's potential future production growth. The sanctions were imposed in 2014, and Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its ""maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures"" totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Russian projects were able to find some other funding sources, including China. Rosneft recently raised funds by selling an $11 billion stake to Qatar and Glencore. If the sanctions are lifted, Croft said the knee jerk reaction in the oil market would likely be a decline in prices just because of the prospect of more supply. Under the sanctions, Russia actually was able to increase its oil production, and the decline in the ruble actually helped producers by keeping production costs lower. Croft said the move in oil prices would be temporary, since the new supply from Russia would not be immediate, and Russia is part of a producers group, with OPEC, that has agreed to cut back production to keep oil prices at a higher level. If the sanctions are lifted, one area of immediate interest would be in the potential for Russian shale. The Bazhenov Shale formation in the West Siberian basin is believed to hold massive reserves of tight oil — which can be reached by U.S.-pioneered technology that Russia can't access because of the sanctions — and that could be one of the first places companies might want to invest. ""Russian oil production has been strong, and it's actually increased until the OPEC deal. It could mean a renewal of Western investment in Russian oil, in the new areas in terms of tight oil, Arctic and offshore,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of research firm IHS Markit. ""The taste for big expensive long term projects is a lot lower today than it was when the sanctions were imposed. One area that is very interesting is tight oil in Russia."" Tight oil has been much cheaper to extract through horizontal drilling than deep water projects. ""There's a debate about how prolific it is,"" said Yergin, who said the Bazhenov by all signs is a huge reserve and would take a while to develop. ""If the analysis of U.S. shale is used, it could be very significant. I think all these development take time, and it takes a lot of experience to determine all of these resources and how to recover it. Certainly it would be a whole new horizon for Russian oil,"" he said. ",President Trump could say 'America first' to end sanctions on Russia,0.9917

He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued.

Video streaming giant Netflix saw its shares rose 3.8 percent, having posted solid results on strong subscriber growth. Overseas, European equities traded mostly lower after the European Central Bank kept monetary policy unchanged.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 19,732.40, with Exxon Mobil leading decliners and UnitedHealth the biggest advancer.

98,Dan Caplinger,1262017,Fool,1192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","
      
    The Best Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors -- The Motley Fool

99,Matthew DiLallo,1262017,Fool,1192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. It would be an understatement to say that 2016 was a tough year for the oil patch. Plunging crude prices heading into the year forced producers to reduce investment spending so deeply that many couldn't even drill enough wells needed to keep production flat. Because of these market conditions, oil companies spent minuscule amounts of capital exploring for new oil and gas sources. As a result, the industry found the fewest new barrels of oil in 70 years. According to a report by energy research firm Rystad Energy, oil companies discovered a mere 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) last year outside of North American shale plays. For perspective, the U.S. alone consumes more than 7 billion barrels annually, which meant the industry did not come close to replacing consumption last year. Meanwhile, offshore discoveries, which is where companies uncovered most of the new sources of oil in recent years, fell 90% from 2010's level to just 2.3 billion BOE last year. This trend is not one that can continue given that world oil demand is not expected to peak until 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Image source: ConocoPhillips. The primary driver of last year's decline was the continued drop in exploration spending. Energy companies only spent $40 billion on exploratory drilling last year, which resulted in 40% fewer wells drilled than in 2014 when prices started on their downward spiral. Global oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for example, cut its global capital and exploratory budget by 24% from 2015's level to $26.6 billion. However, Chevron only earmarked $1 billion of that budget for exploration, well below the $3 billion budget the company set for 2015. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) cut its global exploration and appraisal budget down to $1.4 billion last year, a decline of 22% from 2015. Another culprit behind last year's low level of oil discoveries is that several exploration prospects came up dry. For example, a joint venture between ConocoPhillips, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) struck out in its initial attempt at finding oil in the Shelburne Basin off Canada's Atlantic Coast. As a result, Suncor Energy noted that it had to write off its share of the costs, which totaled 105 million Canadian dollars. That dry hole was one of a growing number of deepwater exploration failures for ConocoPhillips in recent years. In 2015, the company noted that a deepwater exploration well in Angola found a non-commercial gas column and another in the Gulf of Mexico did not encounter any hydrocarbons. As a result, it plugged and abandoned both wells, writing off $142 million in dry hole expenses. These and other dry holes drove its decision to exit deepwater exploration altogether. Image source: Suncor Energy Inc. While oil discoveries were down significantly, oil companies still found several notable new oil and gas deposits. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), for example, announced in June that an offshore well in Guyana confirmed a world-class oil discovery. According to ExxonMobil, this deposit contains between 800 million to 1.4 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Then, in October, the oil giant confirmed a discovery offshore Nigeria that holds between 500 million to 1 billion barrels of oil. Finally, the company capped the year off with a December announcement of a new onshore natural gas discovery in Papua New Guinea. Energy companies made several other smaller discoveries around the world last year. Norwegian oil giant Statoil (NYSE:EQNR), for example, finished up its Canadian Atlantic exploration program last year, which resulted in two more discoveries and the confirmation that its 2013 Bay du Nord find contains between 300 million to 600 million barrels of recoverable oil. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell made a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at its Fort Sumter prospect, uncovering more than 125 million BOE. That was one of three new Gulf finds last year, though that is down from seven in 2015. Image source: Apache Corporation. While offshore discoveries proved tougher to locate, North American onshore shale plays continued to be the gifts that keep on giving. One of the most notable shale discoveries was Apache's (NYSE:APA) Alpine High play in a sleepy part of Texas' Permian Basin. Apache believes that there's at least 3 billion barrels of oil and another 75 trillion cubic feet of gas in just two of the five rock formations underneath its acreage position in the region. Apache believes that the other formations could also contain significant quantities of recoverable hydrocarbons. On top of that, several other producers increased their estimates for ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries from their acreage position in various shale plays. One of the most notable was EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), which more than doubled its Permian Basin net resource potential from 2.35 billion BOE to 6 billion BOE. That upward revision came just a year after EOG Resources boosted its resource estimate in the region by 1 billion BOE due to improved recoveries resulting from advances in technology. The decline in offshore oil and gas discoveries will not have an immediate impact on global oil supplies. That is because it can often take a decade or more to turn offshore finds into production due to the high costs and long construction lead times. Furthermore, there's plenty of prior deepwater discoveries to develop as well as a plethora of shale resources to unleash. That said, the lack of new discoveries in recent years could prove problematic a decade from now as producers deplete currently producing fields. Given the forecast that oil demand will not peak for several decades, it suggests that the world will need to continue uncovering and developing new oil deposits. That means the industry cannot continue the recent history of failing even to come close to replacing production because there will come a point where this shortfall will impact supply.

100,Michael Brush,1262017,MarketWatch,1192017,"Published: Jan 24, 2017 9:50 a.m. ET These are the companies that may benefit the most, according to a survey of analysts and fund managers By Donald Trump’s critics like to claim he doesn’t stand for anything. But that’s just because they haven’t looked hard enough. In speeches, online campaign policy messages and even tweets, Trump has regularly detailed policy reforms especially for business and the economy. These include lower taxes, fiscal stimulus, incentives to bring earnings home and protectionist policies.

They’ll get a relative boost from any ongoing strength in the dollar, since this reduces reported earnings for companies that get much of their earnings overseas. Goldman Sachs singles out the following companies as potential Trump policy beneficiaries because they generate virtually all of their revenue in the U.S. Naturally, many of them are in retail, and consumer products and services.

That’s because the new president is likely to take steps to block subsidized steel from China sold here below cost. “We are going to have greater scrutiny on steel tariffs and how much steel is imported,” says Marshall. U.S. steel companies will also benefit from a rebound in infrastructure spending and manufacturing. “A lot of them are at 60% capacity,” says Marshall. “We think it could get closer to 80% or 90%.” One of his favorites is Commercial Metals

                                   in this space. Companies with low labor costs The labor markets are so tight at 4.7% unemployment, companies have to bid up wages to get or keep workers. This is why average hourly wages recently saw the biggest jump since 2009, at 2.9%. Now, Trump wants to apply fiscal stimulus in the form of personal and corporate tax cuts, and more spending on the military, veterans benefits and infrastructure. That’s an unorthodox policy at full employment, because it risks sparking so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to get overly aggressive in raising rates — which could spook markets. All of this remains to be seen as a risk. In the meantime, with labor costs clearly on the march and greater wage pressure ahead, thanks to Trump stimulus, it makes sense to favor companies that don’t spend a lot on labor, relative to revenue. A group of low-labor-cost companies suggested by Goldman Sachs late last year has vastly outperformed companies with high labor costs. Analysts at the investment bank expect this to continue in 2017, as wages continue to go up and the market prices in higher inflation. As an added plus, the low-labor-cost companies singled out by Goldman Sachs, below, have faster sales and earnings growth compared with high-labor-cost companies. Consumer-facing low-labor-cost companies favored as winners by Goldman Sachs include: Netflix

                                    QCOM, -0.61% Companies that pay high taxes After Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act lowered taxes in October 1986, large-cap companies paying the highest tax rates beat the broad market for the next three years, points out Credit Suisse analyst Lori Calvasina. So now with Trump looking to lower the corporate tax rate, it makes sense to go with companies that pay high tax rates. Trump wants a 15% corporate tax rate. House Republican lawmakers propose a 20% rate. But even a reduction to 25% would boost S&P 500 Index

                                   earnings by 8%, say analysts at Goldman Sachs. As an added plus, many of the high-tax-rate companies also generate most, or all, of their sales at home. That makes them less vulnerable to steps to penalize importers and bigger direct beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus. Stocks to consider because they pay the highest effective tax rates, according to Goldman Sachs, include: Goodyear Tire & Rubber

For now, it’s probably better to stay away from this group, as a Trump play. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword,” says Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. It’s also tough to know at this point which defense programs and services will get priority, says Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi. For now it’s probably best to simply monitor the group for trading opportunities. Lockheed fell hard on Dec. 23 when Trump tweeted negatively about F-35 program costs. But it then went on to post 4% gains in two weeks as it recovered from the Trump twitter storm. Infrastructure plays This group is another tough one. Yes, our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling. You see this all the time when you drive around. And Trump’s plan to boost infrastructure spending would no doubt help this space, especially materials companies like Vulcan Materials

                                    SUM, +2.41% But infrastructure plays face three challenges. 1. The earliest the industry could see any measurable spending benefit from Trump policies would be 2018, said economists Kermit Baker of the American Institute of Architects and Ken Simonson at the Associated General Contractors of America at a lunch recently sponsored by Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy. But it’s more likely to arrive in 2019. That’s a long way off. 2. Trump’s immigration policies could aggravate the construction labor shortage. Immigrants make up 30% of construction labor. 3. The group has rallied a lot, despite those challenges. “Our concern is that something will break investor euphoria,” says Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Indeed, this is a risk for all “Trump plays” and the market in general. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5% since Election Day, which means investors have priced in a lot of Trump success. If he stumbles at all in his legislative agenda, the market could reverse itself, especially because investor sentiment is so high. But as we saw during the campaign, Trump has a way of getting what he wants. So any reversal in the market, and especially the names above, on a Trump stumble will probably be a buying opportunity.

102,Tom DiChristopher,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Exxon Mobil beat earnings forecasts on Tuesday as revenues increased, though the company took a $2 billion impairment charge, mostly due to lowering the value of some of its U.S. gas assets. Excluding one-time items, Exxon reported a fourth-quarter profit of 90 cents a share, versus Wall Street expectations of 70 cents a share. Results for the Irving, Texas-based oil giant were helped by belt-tightening throughout 2016. However, persistently low oil prices and weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business weighed on earnings for the full year. ""Financial results for the year were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in commodity prices and the impairment charge,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. Shares of Exxon slipped about 1 percent Tuesday. Evercore analyst Doug Teresson said many market watchers were focused on the charge. Including that impairment, Exxon would have missed profit forecasts. ""The market did view the result negatively because they missed the headline number, but that's really only because of ... impairments for Exxon, which are non-recurring. And so the clean results were actually similar to consensus, but they were just messy,"" he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report."" Excluding that charge, Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.7 billion, or 90 cents a share. In the period a year ago, it reported earnings of $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share. Revenues for the most recent quarter were $61.01 billion, compared with expectations of $62.28 billion. Exxon said it will increase its 2017 capital spending program, which includes exploration, to an estimated $22 billion. In 2016, capital spending fell 38 percent to $19.3 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from a year ago in all three of the company's major segments: exploration and production, refining and chemicals. The $2 billion impairment resulted from the company's review of its reserves. Exxon determined that some of its U.S. assets' future cash flows no longer exceeded their carrying value. These were primarily in the Rockies. Exxon warned last quarter it would have to revise the amount of unproduced resources it holds if oil prices remained low through the end of the year. In the current price environment, the resources would no longer qualify as proven reserves under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company said at the time. Liquid petroleum products fetched a higher price than they did a year ago. That was partially offset by weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon have seen their refining margins shrink as the price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels, stabilizes above $50 a barrel. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry — improved significantly from last year. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. Cash flow from asset sales was also higher, hitting $2.1 billion, versus about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last week, the company announced a dividend of 75 cents, unchanged from the third quarter. ",Exxon Mobil profit and revenue rise as the oil giant takes $2 billion impairment,0.9556
103,Rebecca Ungarino,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Energy, the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, could see further pain. Chevron, one of the top-weighted holdings in a popular energy ETF (the XLE) fell nearly 2 percent on Monday after posting disappointing quarterly earnings Friday, and Exxon Mobil and Schlumberger closed down about 1 percent each. Crude oil, which has generally moved in tandem with energy names for the last year, has fallen 2 percent in 2017. In a note Monday, Miller Tabak managing director Matt Maley said the XLE is nearing a critical multiyear trend line that if broken could mean the energy sector ""is getting quite close to a compelling decline."" In addition, some strategists noted, futures traders' crude oil positions as expressed in commitment of trader data are at historic extremes, with their longest positions on record. This is quite the contrarian indicator, Maley wrote, as the ""specs"" are ""almost always wrong at extremes."" ""In other words, there are A LOT of people on the bullish side of the boat in crude oil,"" Maley wrote, while ""commercials"" in the energy space have their largest short positions ever. The extreme positioning gives pause to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who sees downside ahead for energy. ""Now when you talk about energy stocks, you have to remember it was the best-performing sector last year, but most of that was a function of a reversal of it being the worst-performing sector for much of 2014 and 2015. And the bulk of that gain came in the early part of last year. So if you weren't overweight energy stocks by April, you missed out on most of the outperformance,"" Krinsky said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" And now, Krinsky said, the opposite is occurring; the XLE relative to the S&P 500 as well as on an absolute basis is beginning to break down below its uptrend line back to early 2015, echoing some of Maley's sentiment. However, Eddy Elfenbein, editor of the Crossing Wall Street blog, likes energy at this juncture in light of recently agreed-upon production cuts from OPEC.   ""I think it's just an unwinding of some of the recent trades. I mean, oil has had a spectacular year since the lows of about a year ago,"" Elfenbein said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""    The XLE is up 25 percent in the last year. Elfenbein noted the energy sector's poor performance over the last seven weeks or so, but sees upside in roughly six months to a year as crude oil production cuts will take some time to play out.    ""The key, this is the big game changer is that the OPEC cuts that they announced in November, these were the first major cuts in eight years, they're actually working. OPEC… they never cooperate. And it really is working this time,"" Elfenbein said, adding that such cuts had put a ""floor"" of sorts at the $50 a barrel level.     Still, the technicals in Krinsky's eyes don't appear promising.   ""We don't think it's going to be anything like we saw in 2015, but [the] XLE probably has some more downside, lower to mid-60s,"" Krinsky said, adding that although the ETF is still well above its 200-day moving average, the extreme positions are reason enough to believe underperformance will continue in the near term.

104,Tom DiChristopher,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Shares of Chevron gave up about 2 percent of their value in pre-market trading Friday as the oil giant turned in quarterly results that badly missed estimates. Chevron executives pointed to lower margins in its refining business and tax charges as drags on earnings during a conference call. They also said layoffs were largely behind them, but the company would continue looking for ways to drive down costs. The company also said it will be able to fund spending and dividends in 2017 with cash generated from operations, following a downturn that forced oil giants and smaller drillers alike to tap debt and other to sources to pay for normal business operations. ""Our 2016 earnings reflect the low oil and gas prices we saw during the year,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement. ""We responded aggressively to those conditions, cutting capital and operating expenses by $14 billion."" Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said on the conference call Chevron is considering more assets sales. ""Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017,"" she said. Last month, the company said it would lower its capital spending for a fourth consecutive year. Chevron's $19.8 billion program for 2017 will focus on projects with shorter cycles and higher returns aimed at producing oil and gas within two years. That includes more drilling in the the U.S. Permian basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, which is leading the nation's shale oil recovery, Watson said. The company said it was operating 10 oil rigs in the region and planning to add another about every eight weeks, he said on Friday. Chevron also provided updates on its critical Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, which experienced some shutdowns in 2016, as well as its Wheatstone natural gas hub. Watson acknowledged the first phase of Gorgon's ramp-up missed expectations and said Chevron would apply those lessons to future phases there and at Wheatstone. He said the next phase of Gorgon would start processing LNG early in the second quarter. Phase one of Wheatstone is scheduled for mid-2017, with phase two expected six to eight months later. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $415 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had expected Chevron to earn 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. In the year-ago period, Chevron reported a loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, shortly before oil prices hit 12-year lows. Low crude oil and gas prices throughout much of 2016 pushed the oil giant to a loss for the year. For 2016, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million, or 27 cents a share. Cash flow, a key measure of corporate health in the oil and gas industry, was $12.8 billion in 2016, down from $19.5 billion the previous year. Chevron spent $22.4 billion on capital projects and exploration last year, down from $34 billion in 2015, reflecting the industry trend of reducing expenses to weather the downturn. Chevron saw results improve from the year-ago period in its upstream business, which includes exploration and production of fossil fuels. The company chalked that up to lower exploration and operating expenses and its oil and gas fetching a higher price. Oil prices stabilized above $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter after OPEC and other major oil producers agreed to cut production. In the downstream segment, which includes refining and marketing fuel, Chevron saw fourth-quarter profits slide both in the United States and abroad. The company broke even in its U.S. downstream business, compared with profits of $496 million a year ago. Integrated oil companies such as Chevron have seen their refining margins shrink on the rising price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 7 percent from sales of $28 billion a year ago. On Wednesday, the San Ramon, California-based oil giant announced a quarterly dividend of $1.08 a share, unchanged from the previous quarter, when it hiked the shareholder payout by a penny.

105,Fred Imbert,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Monday, notching their worst day of the year, as a new measure taken by the Trump administration on immigration sent jitters through the market. President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday that would temporarily bar entry into the U.S. to Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens. The order seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. In signing the order, Trump said he pledged to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America."" ""We spent the first two months [following the election] focusing on the positives for companies. What we're seeing here is  that life is not a straight line,"" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. ""Perhaps the market is looking at the other side of things. Maybe the Trump administration is not going to do all the things businesses want."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell around 120 points after sliding more than 223.39 points, dropping below 20,000, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent, with energy shedding 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling 0.8 percent. ""I think it also has to do with what the immigration policy represents [in terms of] the way the Trump administration is going to operate,"" said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. ""The fact is that you've got a major policy that was implemented very quickly. That's causing uncertainty."" The order sparked outrage as thousands took to the streets across the U.S. in protest. Several world and corporate leaders also condemned the order. On Saturday, a federal judge issued an emergency stay to halt the deportation of people with valid visas who landed in the U.S. ""The Trump worries are now beginning to set in,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. ""We're having this ongoing worry effect that could overtake earnings and economic data."" The U.S. stock market has seen a massive rally since Trump's election, with the S&P and Dow advancing 7.25 percent and 9.61 percent since Nov. 8, respectively. ""You're coming off all-time highs on virtually every index,"" said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds. ""It doesn't take much for people to take a breather."" Traders have bet on Trump's promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation that would boost growth, just as earnings have begun growing again. ""While investors were very quick to price in the expected impact that deregulation, infrastructure spending and job growth could have on the U.S. economy, I find it very difficult to believe that after pricing in heavy premiums based on fiscal promises, that investors are not now reconsidering what damage Trump might do by implementing other promises that supplemented an incoherent and ranting political campaign,"" said Jameel Ahmad, vice president of research at FXTM. ""Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the U.S.,"" Ahmad said. In economic news, pending home sales for December rose 1.6 percent, while personal income rose 0.3 percent, below an expected increase of 0.4 percent. The data releases come a day before the Federal Reserve kicks off its first monetary policy meeting of the year. The central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percent at its December meeting. However, market expectations for a rate following this meeting are just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""I'm as enthused as anyone about tax cuts (even though we don't know what final form will look like) and regulatory relief (but worried about trade protectionism and immigration bans),"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. ""But to think that somehow the Fed is no longer relevant to both the economy and markets as they step up rate hikes I think is delusional,"" Boockvar said. U.S. Treasurys were mostly steady, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding near 2.496 percent and the short-term two-year note yield around 1.22 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.069 and the yen around 113.7. In corporate news, earnings season continues this week as the likes of Exxon Mobil, Apple, Facebook and UPS get set to report quarterly results. European stocks traded broadly lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.05 percent. In Asia, stocks also fell, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 dropping 0.51 percent. The Shanghai equity market was closed for the Chinese New Year holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.65 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 19,971.13, with Caterpillar leading decliners and Wal-Mart the top advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 13.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 2,280.90, with energy leading all nine sectors lower and consumer staples and utilities advancing. The Nasdaq composite slid 47.07 points, or 0.83 percent, to close 5,613.71. About three stocks declined for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 873.13 million and a composite volume of 3.585 billion at the close.

ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) peers have written down and impaired the value of several of their assets since the beginning of this oil and gas downturn, but ExxonMobil had not yet done so. That changed this past quarter when the company took a $2 billion hit to the bottom line. Despite that large asset charge, ExxonMobil's results weren't all that bad. Let's take a look at the numbers to see why the fourth quarter should give some hope for the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: ExxonMobil earnings release. * In millions, except per-share data. Last quarter, management gave everyone a heads-up that we should expect a sizable asset writedown this quarter. Well, we got it. Management took a $2.02 billion asset impairment, mostly related to its dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains. This is a little bit of a surprise, actually. Based on the statement last quarter about taking oil and gas reserves off the books, there was the assumption that assets like its Canadian oil sands would be impaired. This writedown is pretty revealing, though. Management does writedowns based on discounted cash flows for those assets and the current carrying values of those assets. So reading the tea leaves into this impairment charge, we can come to two conclusions: The long life aspect of Canadian oil sands means that their asset value may not face as much risk as many might assume, and that there has been a permanent structural shift in natural gas production and pricing in the U.S. Aside from that one big change, the rest of ExxonMobil's results were par for the course. Downstream and chemical results suffered slightly from rising crude oil prices that impacted feedstock costs for these segments, and some favorable tax-related items gave its corporate segment a rare gain. DATA SOURCE:  EXXONMOBIL EARNINGS RELEASES. CHART BY AUTHOR. The one bright spot in the quarter was ExxonMobil's cash from operations. The $7.4 billion in cash was more than enough to cover its $4.8 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, but fell just short of also covering the $3.1 billion in dividend payments. The $2.1 billion in asset sales helped to make up for the rest without having to take on any additional debt, something few integrated oil and gas companies have been able to do lately. Management quickly put that excess cash generation to work as it reduced total debt by $3.4 billion to $42.8 billion. Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury gave his typical ""just the facts"" conference call, where he pointed out on multiple occasions that the company was generating more cash from operations than its capital budget. He said: ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day and maintain focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015, as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to push -- pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance, combined with continued investment and cost discipline, generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion, and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered the dividend and net investments in the business. ExxonMobil's results, even adding in the large asset impairment, weren't that bad. The big asset charge hides the fact that the company's cash generation has improved significantly compared to the prior quarter and portends a much better 2017. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of ExxonMobil, its analyst day presentation is on March 1, where it will go into detail about its production and spending outlook for the next several years.

    ExxonMobil's Earnings Slip on a Rare Writedown -- The Motley Fool

107,Tyler Crowe,2022017,Fool,1262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

108,Rich Smith,2022017,Fool,1262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

109,Barbara Kollmeyer,2022017,MarketWatch,1262017,"Published: Jan 31, 2017 3:39 p.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By Traders begging for nonpresidential drivers may get exactly that today, thanks to Apple and the start of a Fed meeting. “This week was supposed to be dominated by central banks’ decisions, earnings, and economic data from across the globe, but with Donald Trump in office, nothing seems capable of taking the spotlight from the White House.” That was FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed in a note that pretty much nails the mood. The jitters look set to stick around today, with some youngsters in for a #SaturdayNightMasscare history-refresher after Trump sent a defiant attorney general packing: Much debate now surrounds just when to start worrying about politics in earnest, and Sayed has one answer: “The major risk looming now is the breakup of the Republican coalition, although this doesn’t seem to be the case for now. I believe it’s going to be the biggest risk to financial markets in the near future, as we end up with protectionist policies without the implementation of fiscal policies, thus triggering a sharp reversal in stocks worldwide.” Our call of the day echoes this a bit. From Macro Man blogger Macronick comes the warning that markets could be headed for an “escalator up, elevator down” selloff. And “even a garden-variety 5% dip in the S&P would feel pretty vicious,” given the subdued state of volatility over the last two months, the blogger adds. If the Trump administration “overplays its hand,” eroding its relationship with the GOP, its much-anticipated infrastructure spending and tax-cut programs could get delayed or downsized, Macronick says. Then, harking back to the debt-ceiling shock of 2011, a prolonged political upset could start to hit growth and business confidence. Next would come a reflation reversal for stocks. While we’re not there yet, there’s plenty of time for more fireworks, says Macronick. “Investors have been viewing Trump as a second coming of Reagan,” the blogger adds. “They should remember his presidency may yet end up bearing much in common with Nixon’s—a period marked by widespread civil unrest and extreme animosity between the White House and press.” To be sure, strategists have been warning about Trump-inspired selling for a while, and the market has instead scored records.

Here’s his chart (table): “The data clearly show that the S&P 500 has historically traded strongly into the first rate hike but then has lost momentum as monetary policy has been tightened making little or no progress, on average, for the 12-month period that followed increase in headline U.S. borrowing costs,” says Mould.

The business will be integrated into DCC’s energy unit and DCC will sign a long-term supply agreement with Esso Norge.

113,Tyler Crowe,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

114,Rich Smith,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

Hess (NYSE:HES) isn't off to a great start in 2017. While the company reported relatively good news last month and some analysts liked what they saw, investors apparently wanted much more. Hess' stock started on a downward spiral after the company released its 2017 guidance. The driller said it was boosting capex to $2.25 billion, which was up 18% from last year. That capital would enable the company to increase production by 8% to 12% when measuring its exit-to-exit rate while delivering an average rate of 300,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). Analysts, however, were expecting more. Their consensus was that the company would spend $2.4 billion and produce 320,000 BOE/d. Image source: Hess. That said, J.P. Morgan came out in support of the company, saying that its post-guidance sell-off was a buying opportunity. The bank reiterated its overweight rating and $65 price target. Furthermore, it noted that the company's longer-term earnings power was improving due in part to an expanding resource base in Guyana. Speaking of Guyana, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) reported positive results from an exploration well in the country, noting that it encountered high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. ExxonMobil also stated that an appraisal well in the country identified another high-quality reservoir below the Liza field. ExxonMobil also said that the Liza field should produce as much as 100,000 barrels of oil per day when it begins flowing in 2020. These positive developments are excellent news for Hess, which owns a 30% interest in these exploration blocks. Another weight on Hess' stock last month was the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. While the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss thanks to cost reductions, investors still sold off the stock, apparently expecting more. Meanwhile, CEO John Hess said on the conference call that the company plans to triple its rig count in the Bakken to six, and will bring its Stampede project in the Gulf of Mexico on line next year, which are catalysts for future production growth. Aside from issuing production guidance that was slightly below forecast, Hess did everything right last month. Its financial results improved, its exploration efforts uncovered more oil, and it has visible growth prospects on the horizon.

118,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks’ ties to the sector. In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown. The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks’ involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices. The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules. Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain. The Fed’s proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator’s highest charge for the riskiest investments. The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns. In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities. In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt “competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy.” A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp, have also cited liquidity and price concerns. Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. Industry sources say the fight against the Fed’s proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.    Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground. ","

Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground. ","

120,Mark Fahey,2232017,CNBC,2162017,"President Donald Trump's tax plan may cut the federal business income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but dozens of companies are already enjoying rates below the new maximum. The plan would be a windfall for retailers like Best Buy and CVS and for financial services companies like Visa and JPMorgan Chase, which tend to pay close to the 35 percent. On the other hand, companies that have access to substantial tax deductions and are already below 15 percent could suffer if the cut comes at the expense of closing tax loopholes. The average effective federal tax rate for profitable Fortune 500 companies was a little under 20 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a 2014 study by the progressive tax reform organization Citizens for Tax Justice. About 35 percent of those companies were already under Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. CTJ is in the process of updating those calculations, and most companies' tax rates have been fairly consistent over the long term. It's hard to know exactly how Trump's tax plan would affect individual companies, partly because the administration hasn't released the details of its proposal yet. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would make a ""phenomenal"" tax announcement in two or three weeks. On Wednesday he said tax reform was ""very well finalized"" but that it wouldn't come until after health-care reforms. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he wants to see the reforms passed before Congress goes on its August recess. According to Trump's published tax plan, ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes."" Mnuchin said the administration is looking at a combined plan with Republicans in Congress, who have been pushing a 20 percent business tax and a controversial border adjustment tax. The final mix of reforms could very well benefit companies that are currently paying more than 15 or 20 percent, while driving up taxes for companies that already have low rates thanks to loopholes. Trump's strategy for keeping the tax cuts revenue-neutral depends in part on eliminating some ""special interest loopholes."" ""You can make the basic observation that companies like Exxon Mobil that are routinely able to reduce their tax bill will likely benefit much less than companies in the retail sector, which traditionally pay a lot closer to 35 percent,"" said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at CTJ. ""Congress has enacted special tax breaks for a number of different industries, but retailers are generally unaffected and there aren't a lot of breaks designed for them."" Take a company like Amazon, which has paid 11 percent in taxes on its domestic income over the last eight years. According to the company's annual report, that rate was reached using a number of special deductions, including stock-based compensation deductions, accelerated depreciation deductions, research and development credits, and the domestic production activities deduction. Companies like Boeing (-1 percent from 2008 to 2012) and Honeywell (8 percent) use similar deductions and credits. ""The companies that tend to do the best tend to be companies that make a lot of capital investments, like utilities or manufacturers because the accelerated depreciation rules have been so generous over the last couple of decades,"" said Gardner. ""They give big rewards to anyone investing in factories or machinery."" Generally, the biggest deductions are more useful for companies in utilities, telecommunications, oil and gas, manufacturing and some pharmaceutical companies, while retailers, financial services, food companies and health-care companies tend to pay closer to the statutory rate. Take a look at all the profitable Fortune 500 companies below: The final impact of Trump's tax plan depends a lot on the revenue trade-offs that are included to pay for the cuts. A border tax, for example, would be a hit on retailers, but dropping the business tax rate would also disproportionately help retailers. Big companies may lose some deductions, but the plan also calls for a one-time repatriation of the $2.5 trillion in corporate cash sitting offshore at a 10 percent rate, which would save companies like Apple, Microsoft and Citigroup billions of dollars. As the plan stands now, it would increase the federal debt by $7.2 trillion over the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. An analysis by the Tax Foundation estimated revenues would be decreased by at least $4.4 trillion over the next decade, depending on the specific policy changes. Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it.""

121,Bob Pisani,2232017,CNBC,2162017,"Home Depot is at another historic high on Tuesday following its excellent earnings report, but a major factor behind its stock price rise has been dividend hikes (it raised its dividend 29 percent on Tuesday), and an aggressive buyback program, including the new $15 billion share buyback program that it also announced. To give you an idea of just how big a $15 billion buyback is, the company's market cap is roughly $175 billion, so we are talking about buying back nearly 9 percent of the company. Even by the standards of the last decade, that is a big buyback. Home Depot is part of a select group of companies I call ""buyback monsters,"" companies that have bought back more than 25 percent of their shares since 2000. Why 2000? Because most companies hit their highest levels of shares outstanding between 2000 and 2006; since then, most companies have been reducing share count, in some cases aggressively. Consider Home Depot. In 2003, they had 2.36 billion shares outstanding, according to Factset. Today, they have 1.21 billion shares outstanding. That is half the shares they had outstanding 14 years ago. All other things being equal, that means earnings are twice as high as they would have been in 2003, when there were twice as many shares outstanding. Home Depot isn't alone. IBM had 1.9 billion shares outstanding in 1997, today it has about 950 million, again less than half what it had 20 years ago. ExxonMobil had 7 billion shares outstanding in 2000, today it has 4.1 billion, a reduction of about 42 percent. This is not a trend that is limited by any one sector. There are companies that have been aggressively reducing their share counts in Industrials, Technology, and Consumer: Industrials: share count reductionsNorthrup Grumman: 50 percent since 2003CSX: 29 percent since 20003M: 25 percent since 2000United Technologies: 25 percent since 2005 Technology: share count reductionsMicrosoft: 30 percent since 2004Intel: 30 percent since 2001Cisco: 32 percent since 2001 Why are there buybacks at all? They were originally used to support the issuance of stock options. The options increased the share count outstanding, so to keep the count down the company bought back shares. But as the opportunity for significant top-line growth waned, buybacks to reduce share counts became a separate strategy to prop up earnings growth. And that's my beef: Buybacks are a form of financial engineering. Here's another problem: It's not at all clear that buying companies just because they are buying back shares will be a successful investment strategy. Take IBM — despite being one of the most aggressive buyback monsters on the Street, you can't say IBM's stock price has soared in the last decade. In 2014, the company eased off a bit on its buybacks, and the stock headed south. It headed south because IBM was beset by fundamental growth issues: Its revenues from its old line businesses were shrinking and there was notrevenue from nascent businesses (like Watson and artificial intelligence) replacing it. The lesson: No amount of financial engineering like buying back shares can replace management's inability to grow the business. Not surprisingly, there are ETFs for all this, but their performance has been spotty. ThePowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF (PKW) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares in the previous 12 months. Top holdings include McDonald's, Boeing, and QUALCOMM. It has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in the last year, but it has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points over a two-year period. So just reducing shares doesn't necessarily mean that companies will outperform. A better approach might be that taken by the AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS), which uses a ""smart beta"" approach that screens not just for reduction of shares but also free cash flow, and no increase to leverage. The TTFS has outperformed the PKW by about 9 percentage points in the past two years. Do not expect buybacks to go away. Buybacks could become an even bigger business, if the whole business of tax reductions become a reality. Billions could be repatriated from overseas, and most strategists believe that a large amount of that money could find its way into buybacks. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Tariff concerns remain a key talking point on Wall Street when dissecting the market volatility fit over the past month, but the issue seems to be carrying less heft among corporate executives. Aurora Cannabis reported on Monday that revenue jumped 260 percent over the last 12 months, with kilograms produced climbing to 4,996 from 1,010 over the past year.

122,"George Budwell, Rich Smith, and Neha Chamaria",2232017,Fool,2162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, can be a powerful and smart way to pursue above-average income opportunities in the market. The short story is that ETFs provide instant diversification, thus lowering the risk of holding a single high-yield stock that may turn out to be a ticking time bomb later on down the road. Given the expansive universe of high-yield ETFs in existence at the moment, however, it's not exactly easy to choose the cream of the crop. Our Foolish team of dividend experts, though, think that the iShares Core High Dividend (NYSEMKT:HDV), the Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ), and the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:DWX) could all boost your portfolio's earnings power to the next level. Here's why. Image Source: Getty Images. George Budwell (iShares Core High Dividend): While the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund's yield of 3.31% won't exactly knock your socks off, this well-diversified ETF does come with a rock bottom expense ratio of 0.12% and a solid track record of producing outstanding returns on capital. Long story short, the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund has marched steadily northward since its inception approximately 6 years ago, outperforming most of its peers in the process: HDV data by YCharts. What's underneath the hood? This ETF tracks a dividend-weighted index of 75 U.S. equities that pay a better than average yield. And as an added measure, the fund also screens equities for high earnings potential and dividend sustainability in order to up the overall quality of its holdings. The net result is that the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund is made up of mostly dividend stalwarts like ExxonMobile, Chevron Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, among many others. That's an impressive roster of blue-chip companies by any measure and underscores why this ETF has performed so well during the market's lengthy bull run over the past several years. As a prime example, J&J has been able to maintain one of the strongest balance sheet ratings among U.S. equities for decades, despite its heavy investment in its dividend program and R&D activities. Pfizer is also a well-known cash cow with outstanding free cash flows and a superb balance sheet in its own right. In all, this dividend ETF offers a nice mix of high-quality equities, a respectable yield, and a bargain-basement expense ratio. Neha Chamaria (Vanguard REIT ETF): With a dividend yield of 6%, Vanguard REIT ETF is my top pic for income investors. As its name suggests, this ETF invests only in REITs, which also explains its high yields, though it isn't exactly a dividend-themed fund. As you might know, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their income to shareholders to avoid paying taxes. This ETF, which tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, holds 156 real estate investment trust stocks that invest in properties across diverse sectors, including healthcare, industrials, offices, residential, and hotels. You can get a fair idea about the diversity within the REITs this ETF offers when you realize that its top holdings include names like Simon Property Group, Public Storage, Prologis, and Equinix. At about 23%, retail REITs have the largest exposure in this ETF, and residential and specialized REITs come in next with about 16% share in assets each. You might be wondering why I'm optimistic about a REIT ETF in a rising interest rate scenario -- higher interest rates, after all, have traditionally hurt REIT valuations. Vanguard, however, has held up pretty strong in the past three months, and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to do so. One reason is that most of the ETF's top holdings have strong track records of growth in funds from operations and dividends. Just to give you an example, Simon Property's dividend has grown at an annual compounded rate of 13.2% in the past five years. Moreover, as Vanguard is a diversified ETF, there will ideally almost always be pockets of strength in its portfolio even during adverse times. Potential higher infrastructure spending under Donald Trump's presidency could, for instance, boost manufacturing activity and prospects for office and industrial REITs, allowing them to command higher rents. Likewise, higher consumer confidence bodes well for retail REITs, and so on. Finally, this ETF's expense ratio of 0.12% is not only substantially lower than those of industry peers, but also among the lowest in the REIT space. That means greater savings and higher returns for shareholders while they enjoy the hefty dividends along the way. Right now, the U.S. dollar is still not far off its five-year high, making companies' income earned (and dividends paid) in foreign currency worth relatively less when converted back into U.S. dollars. To my mind, that makes now a good time to look for foreign dividend payers as a promising investment -- because they'll be worth more once exchange rates turn around. My pick for this play on exchange rates is therefore the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF, which tracks the 100 highest-yielding dividend-paying companies outside the U.S. This $1 billion fund carries a hefty, but not unreasonable, expense ratio of 0.45%, but a market-beating dividend yield of 5.1%. Even after deducting expenses, the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF yields twice the average dividend yield on the S&P 500. Valuation-wise, this ETF's stocks carry an average P/E ratio of 17.1 -- which is also well below the S&P's average P/E of 25.7. The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF achieves diversification in its portfolio by capping exposure to any given region of the world at 25% (it's maxed out on financials right now, for example, and getting close to 25% on energy companies), and capping exposure to individual market sectors at 25% as well. Although DWX has underperformed over the past five years, it may finally be coming into its own here near the dollar's peak, and delivered a near 25% return to investors over the past year. My bet: The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF will continue to outperform as the dollar's value peaks, plateaus, and begins to drop off. ","

The EEA joins a growing list of joint initiatives by large companies aiming to take advantage of blockchain, a shared digital record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. Companies in a wide range of industries are hoping that it can help them streamline some of their processes, such as the clearing and settling of financial securities. The EEA underscores the enthusiasm around the nascent technology, but also highlights some of the hurdles that companies must still overcome before they can deploy blockchain on a large scale. This includes ensuring that the technology can support the vast number of transactions processed by large corporations, while being secure enough to meet their stringent security standards. Unlike some other collaborative efforts, members do not need to pay a fee to participate in the EEA, for now. Ethereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications, was invented by 23-year-old programer Vitalik Buterin. Several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. Alex Batlin, global blockchain lead at BNY Mellon, one of the companies on the EEA board, said over the past few years banks and other enterprises have increased collaboration with the Ethereum development community, facilitating the creation of the EEA. “There is a lot more synergy in thinking than was ever possible before,” Batlin said.

(V) and retailer Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY), which generally pay close to the top rate of 35%, according to CNBC. Many investors will likely focus on Trump's joint address to Congress on February 28, during which he is expected to discuss his plans for tax reform, The Washington Post reported. However, many firms will likely derive little benefit from such tax reform, as they already have an effective tax rate below 15%. (For more, see also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.) While there are many companies that have paid a low effective rate in recent years, a perfect example is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The online retailer has enjoyed an effective tax rate of 11% on its domestic income over the last eight years, according to CNBC. Amazon harnessed several special deductions, including ones involving accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, and research and development credits, according to the company's annual report. Amazon is not alone in benefiting from this special treatment, as companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) are ""routinely able to reduce their tax bill,"" Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at tax policy think tank Citizens for Tax Justice (CTH) told CNBC. Amid this situation, Exxon Mobil and AT&T Inc. (T) paid effective tax rates of 14% and 7% between 2008 and 2012, CTJ data reveals. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and General Electric Company (GE) both had negative rates during that time, paying 2% and 11%,respectively. However, the special deductions that these companies have been leveraging are likely to disappear under Trump's plan, Stephan Unger, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Investopedia during an interview. The ""current special deduction possibilities are likely to get abandoned to make the system more transparent and efficient,"" he said. However, whether or not ""special tax treatments for specific companies"" will end up disappearing completely remains unclear, stated Unger. Tax expert Nate Smith offered a different point of view, stating during a separate interview with Investopedia that while ""certain industries (like oil and gas) benefit from specific deductions ... the deduction provisions that could be disappearing are not the thrust of what Trump's reform would target."" The more important matter is changing tax law so that companies will repatriate profits, said Smith. Currently, multinational corporations can keep these earnings overseas indefinitely, shielding them from the higher tax rates, he told Investopedia. Frequently, managing their international footprint is the means of minimizing tax expenses, said Smith. Originally, Trump's campaign tax proposal sought to rectify this situation, he noted. (For more, see also: Can Trump Tax Plan Bring Back Overseas Cash?) Because of policies like these, many global companies are paying very little in the way of taxes, Tenpao Lee, interim dean and professor of economics at Niagara University, stated during an Investopedia interview. Should lawmakers cut the top corporate income tax rate to 15%, it would give major companies greater motivation to move their profits back to the United States. However, the impact may not take effect immediately, said Lee, as companies would need time to adjust. For companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), the effect would be significant, whereas companies like Exxon Mobil and Amazon would see less of an impact, he told Investopedia.

127,Reuben Gregg Brewer,3022017,Fool,2232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

128,,3022017,MarketWatch,2232017,"The Dow Jones industrial average stormed past 21,000 for the first time Wednesday as investors absorbed President Trump’s address to Congress, in which he pledged business-friendly proposals like tax cuts, deregulation and an increase in infrastructure and defense spending. Wednesday’s sprint past 21,000 matched the previous record for 1,000-point gains, set in 1999 when the Dow ran from 10,000 to 11,000 in 24 trading sessions. “President Trump came out and gave a presidential speech, which reassured a lot of people who questioned whether his administration would reach normality,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “The political uncertainty has been one of the factors holding the market back in the face of an improving economy. The fact that political uncertainty may be starting to subside may be counted as really good news.” Stocks motored across the board Wednesday. The Dow closed at 21,115, a 1.4 percent gain on the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index increased 1.3 percent, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index was up 1.9 percent. Apple, Boeing and Goldman Sachs Group have propelled most of the gain in the Dow industrials during its 1,000-point dash. Wednesday was the biggest one-day point lift for the blue-chip index since Election Day 2016. The 30 stocks have continued to surge from below 19,000 without looking back. “In terms of percentage moves, the move in 1999 was much larger,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. “Nonetheless, this only reinforces how strong the rally has been since the election.” Detrick said the strong earnings season is pushing the market forward more than Trump. “This helps justify the gains, as it isn’t all based on hopes for tax reform or infrastructure spending,” he said. “There is real economic improvement now that has sparked much of the rally.” William Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday night that tightening monetary policy had become “more compelling,” making a rate increase more likely for March 15. Higher interest rates are good for banks’ loan business. The market responded, with JPMorgan Chase shares up 3.3 percent Wednesday and Citigroup shares up 2.9 percent. Wednesday’s gains overshadowed the reported pricing of Snap Inc. at $17 per share, which would value the parent of the popular disappearing-message app Snapchat at almost $24 billion and above the projected share range of $14 to $16. The stock is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the “SNAP” ticker. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes was 2.45 percent. The 30-year yield climbed above 3 percent. Crude oil declined, and gold fell to $1,249.80 per ounce as investors swarmed stocks. Analysts said they did not see anything tying down equities. “Sentiment keeps improving,” McMillan said. “With consumer confidence at 15-year highs, with manufacturing sentiment continuing to move up, the economy and business are actually quite sound.” Read more: The big-deal lesson from the (not so important) Dow 20,000 What the Yahoo sale tells us about stock market bubbles This could change everything we thought we knew about investing  ","Dow busts through 21,000 threshold on feel-good Trump message - The Washington Post",0.9953

Some analysts suggested that the absence of protectionist comments as well as his overall tone that was perceived as “presidential” instilled confidence among investors, sending global equity markets higher. Stocks even rose slightly higher following the release of the Fed’s Beige Book, which pointed out that business optimism has cooled a bit since the election.

The surge for stocks, on the heels of Trump’s speech, also comes as the expectation for a rate increase by the Federal Reserve as early as mid-March have increased significantly. The probability for a March rate increase stands at 66%, up from a probability of 35% on Tuesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “What’s really changed on the economic front is tough to say,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, in an interview. “But the Trump speech moved expectations higher. Now it’ll be a surprise if [the Fed doesn’t] raise rates.” Read:  This stock-market rally isn’t all about Trump’s newfound ‘tone’ Adding to that, on Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for a U.S. interest rate increase has become “a lot more compelling.” “The economy is doing well, as we can see from today’s inflation and manufacturing numbers and any additional stimulus will put it into even a higher gear, and stock markets like that,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “I think the Fed’s clear optimism about the economy, even when not factoring in a Trump boost, is feeding the positive sentiment in the markets at the moment,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in emailed comments. “Investors don’t fear rate increases like they have in the past, instead it’s the pace of tightening that they’re focused on, and three hikes this year is clearly palatable,” he added. However some investors still see prices for stocks getting lofty after a string of records for U.S. equity benchmarks in 2017. Substantial gains in the markets have sent valuations to highest levels in more than a decade, with some analysts warning of potential pullbacks. “When markets are extended and overbought, they are vulnerable to any shocks that could trigger pullbacks or corrections,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. The Dow industrials ran from clearing 20,000 for the first time to clearing 21,000 in 24 sessions, tying a record set in 1999 for the shortest 1,000-point gain. While the current jump is smaller on a percentage basis, it’s still psychologically compelling, especially when it took nearly two years for the Dow to reach 19,000 after it first passed 18,000, as markets were dealing with an earnings recession, Detrick said. “Now, earnings are picking up and we’re breaking out in quick fashion,” said Detrick. “The concern now is if we got to 22,000 quickly and hit a blowoff top. Some pullback is normal and we want to see a correction. No more than 5% to 7% would be perfectly normal considering the rally since the election.” Themis’s Kepner also said that at some point markets will need specifics on the fiscal stimulus to justify current price-to-earnings ratios. “But for now, it seems that investors are content with the reasonable tone of the president, while impending rate hikes are seen in the context of an improving economy,” Krosby said. On the data front, a report on personal income and outlays showed that the cost of goods and services outpaced household income, with the year-over-year inflation rising to the highest level since 2012. Higher pace of inflation is another reason the Fed might be eager to go ahead with rate normalization sooner rather than later. The manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.7% in February, its best level in more than two years. Meanwhile, construction spending declined 1% in January.

130,Ryan Vlastelica,3022017,MarketWatch,2232017,"Published: Feb 27, 2017 8:07 a.m. ET Dow’s 11-day streak of records is longest since 1987 By U.S. stocks staged a last-minute rally on Friday, with major indexes turning positive ahead of the closing bell and the Dow extended its record-setting streak as investors shrugged off concerns the rally was overdone. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose for a fifth straight week, while the Dow brought its string of weekly gains to three.

The blue-chip average rose for an 11th straight day for the first time since 1992, as well as its 11th straight record closing high—the longest such streak since 1987. The Dow had traded in negative territory for essentially the entire session, only breaking into the green with seconds to spare. “There was concern that the market was getting tired and that we were losing momentum, but there are still significant inflows, because now even the pessimists want a piece of the action. It’s momentum driven, not fundamentally driven,” said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors.

                                   which lost 0.8% on the day. “A lot of the inflows are just blindly into passive vehicles, which pushes the major averages higher. But there is weakness in the Trump-leadership stocks,” Glazer said. “Financials are notably weak, Goldman is notably weak. That’s due to both profit-taking and high valuations.” For the holiday-shortened week, major indexes posted gains. The Dow rose 1% on the week while the S&P added 0.7% and the Nasdaq rose 0.1%. That marked the fifth straight weekly advance for the S&P and the Nasdaq, and the third straight for the Dow. The Dow is up nearly 9.1% over the past three months, with investors attributing gains largely to Trump’s November election victory. Investors are betting that Trump’s policies on taxes and regulation will accelerate economic growth and boost corporate earnings, but concerns are growing over the administration’s ability to deliver on the tax plans. Markets saw little impact from a speech Trump gave at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he said that the U.S. tax code would be made more fair. Investors are also looking ahead to an address that Trump is scheduled to make to Congress on Feb. 28, where he is expected to provide details on his highly anticipated tax reform proposals.

132,,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world’s largest gathering of energy executives. Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said. Woods ran Exxon’s refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon’s growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding. “Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Woods said. “These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics.” The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs. “The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots,” Woods said. Exxon last month pledged to boost this year’s spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company’s spending plans as an example of “a true American success story.” Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year. “This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,” Trump said. When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief. The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports. Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production. Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said. “I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken,” he said. “It underestimates the power of technology.” Woods highlighted Exxon’s research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas. “The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating,” he said. Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors. ","

133,,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

134,Patti Domm,3092017,CNBC,3022017,"The power of the North American energy industry is that it transcends borders, and while it was interconnected way before NAFTA, it is becoming even more so. The ties are deep rooted. In the early 1900s, primitive power lines sent electricity crackling across the border between Texas and Mexico. Canada has long provided the U.S. hydroelectric power, and all three countries now send oil, refined fuels and natural gas back and forth across the northern and southern U.S. borders on a daily basis. With trade the hot topic in Washington and now for all three members of NAFTA, the fallout from the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement and the U.S. proposals about taxing goods at the border can't help but be an important topic when the global energy industry meets in Houston this week. In fact, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will deliver a keynote address on Thursday, which he tweeted would be about innovation and renewable energy. CERAWeek by IHS Markit runs Monday through Friday and participants include energy ministers from Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as CEOs from major oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Total. ""I expect to hear a great deal at CERAWeek from Prime Minister Trudeau and industry leaders about the importance and mutual benefit from the large cross-border energy [integration]. Whatever the eventual outcome of the NAFTA debate, they're not going to want to lose benefits,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS. The Trump administration promises to be a strong supporter of energy, removing regulatory hurdles for the industry and encouraging more U.S. drilling. Just last week former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was approved to be Energy Secretary. Perry has spoken positively about North American integration in the past, and until recently he was on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, which is building pipelines to take natural gas to Mexico. But the administration has also been critical of Mexico for what it claims are unfair trade practices and weak immigration controls. So even though the industry is intertwined, the future course for North American energy is murky. Guaranteed to be discussed at CERAWeek is the proposal from House Republicans to tax imports into the United States at a rate of 20 percent. The so-called border-adjustment tax is a major revenue generator for the House corporate tax reform plan. It is bound to generate as much debate in the energy industry gathering as it has in other affected industries, such as retail. Critics already say it would drive up both oil and gasoline prices. But proponents, among them big industrial companies, say the dollar would adjust by rising sharply and neutralizing some of the impact of higher prices. Conceivably, under the proposal, a barrel of oil from Canada could be taxed as it enters the United States, but the gasoline it is made into would not be taxed when it is sent to Mexico. Likewise, a barrel of U.S. crude would not be taxed as it enters Canada, but the gasoline that comes back down to New England could be taxed. The North American energy interconnections are complex and more established between the United States and Canada, which is the largest crude supplier to the United States and also a net exporter of electricity from connections that run along the border in numerous locations. Canada exports natural gas to the United States, and U.S. natural gas is sold in Canada. But the connections to Mexico are also growing, especially since the country embarked on a reform program to overhaul its energy industry and bring in new investment. It has also been aggressively planning new power generation. Mexico was importing about 4.2 billion cubic feet of U.S. natural gas per day in August, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and analysts say it could get to 5 billion in the near future. U.S. sales of gas to Mexico are also helping depressed U.S. natural gas prices from sinking even lower, analysts say. Gas pipeline exports to Mexico from the United States doubled since 2009. According to Citigroup, new cross-border pipeline capacity of 7 billion cubic feet is expected to come online by 2020, on top of the current 6 billion to 7 billion cubic feet. ""The growing energy integration of North America is very beneficial to all three countries,"" said Yergin. ""U.S. natural gas producers get additional markets, while Mexican consumers get lower-priced electricity generated with that gas. Canadians get markets for their oil, reducing U.S. reliance on Venezuelan oil, while American workers in manufacturing benefit from big equipment markets to the north."" Mexico also recently put out bids for offshore exploration, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the companies receiving awards. ""It will give them an opportunity to bring international technology and capital in to develop Mexico's deep water. Pemex never could have developed that,"" said Carlos Pascual, senior vice president of IHS Markit. Pascual has served as the U.S. State Department's special envoy for energy and coordinator for international energy affairs. He was also a former ambassador to Mexico. José Antonio González Anaya, director general of Pemex, will be a speaker at CERAWeek. Jaime Francisco Hernández Martínez, CEO of Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is also participating. ""The prospects are for additional gas supply only to continue to increase, and right now we see over the next five years, at least, relatively flat prices for natural gas globally, so the question then becomes, Where does American natural gas fit in?"" Pascual said. One solution is exporting it to Mexico, the largest buyer of U.S. natural gas. He said Mexico will also open up its unconventional drilling opportunities, holding its first round of bidding for unconventional oil and gas later this year. ""In the United States, there's been a huge benefit in the sale of natural gas to Mexico and also in the renewable-energy sector. Many of these companies buy GE equipment, for example. GE is a massive player here, particularly in wind turbines, so there's been a very significant boost to American commercial interests as a result of the development of natural gas and the power sector,"" Pascual said. The U.S. oil relationship with Canada, too, can only deepen when the Keystone XL pipeline is built. President Donald Trump waved on that controversial project shortly after his inauguration, and last week the White House said the TransCanada pipeline would be exempted from the new requirement that pipelines be built with U.S. steel. The Keystone would bring 800,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, before it heads to the Gulf Coast. ""This integration is not only beneficial from an economic point of view but also from a development point of view, which was one of the reasons it was encouraged in the first place,"" said Yergin.

135,Reuben Gregg Brewer,3092017,Fool,3022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

136,Jeff Reeves,3092017,MarketWatch,3022017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data. So it is no wonder that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have proven a poor investment, with a return of less than 20% since the March 2009 lows based on the performance of the popular iShares TIPS Bond ETF

However, there’s also a good chance that the Federal Reserve will quickly act to keep inflation in check now that it has been striking a more hawkish tone.

                                    is in favor. But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

Gold is volatile, yes, but seems a decent bet going forward for tactical traders. But remember the history of gold’s performance since 2009, and don’t treat this volatile asset as a sure thing to buy and hold long-term.

But since then, the index has struggled to hold on to further gains, recently dipping under 20,000 just before Christmas. Of course, roughly 90% returns since the bear market lows still annualizes out to over 10% a year, so some folks may not see China as a that bad of a bet. However, it is important to remember that American investors with exposure to Chinese equities often have imperfect exposure to this market.

This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

Of course, the ETF had a heck of a 2016 as energy stocks bounced back with a vengeance; the sector-specific fund tacked on about 25% last year to more than double the S&P 500’s returns. So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general. Profits remain seriously under pressure at both Big Oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp.

138,,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

139,,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, used an alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The attorney general’s office said in a letter on Monday that it found Tillerson had used an alias email address under the pseudonym “Wayne Tracker” from at least 2008 through 2015. Wayne is Tillerson’s middle name. The letter was sent to a New York state judge overseeing Schneiderman’s investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change. In a statement on Monday, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, “The email address, Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, is part of the company’s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics.” Jeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman’s office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. The letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account. It asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the “Wayne Tracker” email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved. The letter said that Exxon had produced some 60 documents bearing the “Wayne Tracker” email but never said it was used by Tillerson for relevant communications at Exxon. It asked the court to order Exxon to identify whether any other email accounts were used by Tillerson. “Exxon’s top executives, and in particular, Mr. Tillerson, have made multiple representations that are at the center of OAG’s (attorney general’s office) investigation of potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public,” the letter said. The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016. ","

141,Matthew Johnston,3162017,Investopedia,3092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On paper, the United States has the highest corporate income tax, at 35%, amongst all of the OECD industrialized nations. President Donald Trump has promised to cut that rate to 15% even as he has boasted that his corporate empire has managed to pay little to no income tax in some years. Yet, he is not alone, as hardly any company pays the full 35%, as indicated in a recent New York Times article. Some companies have even managed to pay absolutely zero in income taxes, and no, it is not because they weren’t profitable. (For more, see: How Trump's Proposals Can Impact Your Taxes.) The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), in a recent study, found that over the eight-year period from 2008 to 2015, 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 21.2%. Over that same period, exactly 18 companies, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E Corp., avoided paying a single penny of federal income tax. The complete list of the 18 corporations is listed below in a graphic from ITEP’s report: A total of 100 companies avoided paying income taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015, and their combined pretax income during that period totaled $336 billion. Yet, instead of paying $118 billion according to the 35% statutory income tax rate, the number of tax breaks applicable to these companies allowed them to earn a negative effective tax rate. That means they actually earned more in their after-tax income than in their pretax income, often due to tax rebates from the U.S. Treasury. There are several major ways that corporations avoid paying taxes, or manage to earn tax subsidies. One way is through finding ways to shift U.S. profits to foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates, a practice known as offshore tax sheltering. Another way is through the use of accelerated depreciation. The relative degree of freedom in tax laws has allowed companies to expense the cost of their capital at a faster pace than it actually wears out. This allows a company to declare less income and thus defer paying taxes until later years, and as long as the company continues to invest, the deferral of taxes can continue for an indefinite amount of time. The giving of stock options to employees, as a part of their compensation, is another avenue that has helped companies reduce their total tax bill. When the options are exercised, the difference between what employees pay for the stock and its market value can be claimed for a tax deduction. Finally, some industries such as research, oil and gas drilling, ethanol production, alternative energy, video game and film production, are privileged by the federal tax code to receive certain tax breaks. (For more, see: How Big Corporations Avoid Big Tax Bills.) Over the eight years, more than half of the total tax subsidies, which totaled $286 billion, went to just 25 companies. AT&T raked in the largest amount with a total of $38 billion in subsidies over the period. Other major recipients included Wells Fargo at $31.4 billion, J.P. Morgan Chase at $22.2 billion, Verizon at $21.1 billion, IBM at $17.8 billion and Exxon Mobil at $12.9 billion.   ",How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax | Investopedia,0.9678
142, ,3162017,CNBC,3092017,"BlackRock Inc, which wields outsized clout as the world's largest asset manager, planned on Monday to put new pressure on companies to explain themselves on issues including how climate change could affect their business as well as boardroom diversity. The move by BlackRock, a powerful force in Corporate America with $5.1 trillion under management, could bolster efforts like climate-risk disclosure practices developed by the Financial Stability Board, the international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. BlackRock, which holds stakes in most major U.S. corporations, identified its top ""engagement priorities"" for meetings this year with corporate leaders in documents to be posted on its website on Monday, with climate risk and boardroom diversity on the list. Reuters received advance copies of the materials. Michelle Edkins, set to oversee the outreach effort as head of a 30-person team, said BlackRock might want to hear from companies about how they are assessing the risk that climate change may pose to their operations. Edkins cited the example of how rising ocean levels could swamp a real estate company's valuable beachfront property. Some companies have shown leadership on the areas BlackRock considers priorities, Edkins said, while others need improvement. ""There are firms where we think they're probably not moving fast enough given the risks to the business,"" Edkins said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The action marked a step-up in BlackRock's advocacy with boards and executives, and comes after the fund giant was criticized by environmental and labor activists for not backing proxy resolutions dealing with climate change and other topics more often at shareholder meetings. BlackRock stopped short of pledging to vote more often against companies' management. It said it still prefers private meetings with executives and casts critical proxy votes only as a last straw. ""We can't micromanage,"" Edkins said. Activists said BlackRock deserves credit for making climate change a central focus. ""They have made a turn in the road. They are looking at their proxies differently,"" said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management in Boston. Outlining its priorities, BlackRock urged some companies to be ready to discuss concerns such as how they could use climate-risk disclosure practices developed by a Financial Stability Board task force. BlackRock also said it will expect that at companies in sectors associated with climate risk such as oil producers, miners or real estate companies, all directors should ""have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business"" and how a given company will address it. As a result of BlackRock's new initiative, Smith said Walden and others including a Seattle city employees' retirement system have withdrawn a proposal calling for the fund giant to review its proxy-voting process and record on climate change. Smith said BlackRock's new approach could make a difference such as on resolutions urging energy giants to report on the impact that public policies aimed at curbing climate change could have on their business. One such resolution at Exxon Mobil last year received support from around 38 percent of votes cast. BlackRock opposed the resolution and owned about 6 percent of the company at the time, securities filings show. Edkins said BlackRock's votes on such measures in the future would depend on circumstances like how they are worded. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment ahead of the company's proxy statement due next month. BlackRock also said it will look to understand how companies are working to increase boardroom diversity, such as adding more women. ""Diverse boards, including but not limited to diversity of expertise, experience, age, race and gender, make better decisions,"" BlackRock said in the documents. Some companies wrongly believe they already possess a diverse board of directors, Edkins said. ""A guy from Yale and a guy from Harvard does not count as diversity,"" Edkins said. BlackRock's guidance marks the latest investor call for corporate executives to pay more attention to matters to which they might have given little thought in the past. New deposits into funds that invest according to environmental, social or responsible governance criteria have been a rare bright spot for active fund managers lately. Big fund firms have taken notice. State Street Corp, a BlackRock rival, used International Women's Day last week to urge companies to improve their board diversity. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has advocated governance reforms in annual letters to other CEOs, such as urging them to avoid too much focus on short-term results. BlackRock said it also plans to press boards about worker issues in light of matters such as uneven wage growth. Edkins pointed to Wal-Mart Stores Inc as an example of a company that embraced the idea that higher wages can lead to a more-engaged workforce. ""Pay that doesn't seem to achieve some sense of equity within a company is likely to make an unattractive place to work,"" Edkins said.

Here's a bit of trivia for you: Over its lifetime, the popular crowd-funding website Kickstarter has created enough jobs to fill up an entire monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics job report. Image source: Getty Images. Even if you discount the part-time workers, that makes for more than three full-time jobs created for each successful start-up, confirming that Kickstarter ""companies"" are more than just one lonely nerd working in a garage. At the very least, each of those nerds has two full-time, salary-drawing employees on the payroll -- and a couple dozen collaborators doing piecework on his project. From 2009 through August 2015, when I last looked in on Kickstarter's progress, the company had helped its users attract crowd funding for more than 90,000 projects. That number has since kicked up to well over 120,000, with ""19,235 successfully funded projects"" in 2016 alone. Every dollar pledged to a successfully funded project resulted in $2.46 in additional revenue for the creator, leading to an estimated $5.3 billion in additional economic activity, says Penn. In total, the University estimates that Kickstarter has added $5.3 billion to the national GDP over the past eight years. It's also done its part as a responsible taxpayer. In 2016, the company says it paid a ""combined effective tax rate of 25%."" Image source: Kickstarter. Of course, unlike Exxon, Kickstarter is not a publicly traded stock. Privately held, it would ordinarily be under no obligation to disclose any of the facts and figures we've discussed here. That said, in 2015, Kickstarter reincorporated itself as a special kind of corporation -- a ""public benefit corporation."" PBCs also undertake to publish an annual benefit report updating the general public on the overall social impact their activities have had in the preceding year. It was this report that led to the revelations last week -- and we look forward to reading many more such reports as Kickstarter continues to lead the crowd-funding movement in years to come.

144,"Timothy Green, Matthew DiLallo, Dan Caplinger, and Brian Feroldi",3162017,Fool,3092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For long-term dividend investors, the best type of stock is one that can be bought and largely forgotten about, with the occasional checkup to make sure those dividend checks aren't in danger. A few of the Fool's contributors have identified four high-yield dividend stocks that fit this description. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), ONEOK (NYSE:OKE), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) are great buy-and-hold dividend stocks. Tim Green (Microsoft): Being a technology company, Microsoft is more susceptible to disruption than other dividend-paying stalwarts. But it's not a company that investors need to worry too much about. Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has shed its image as a tech dinosaur and aggressively embraced cloud computing. Microsoft's stranglehold on the productivity software market remains intact, its cloud-computing platform is a strong No. 2 player, and innovations like the HoloLens augmented reality headset could put Microsoft right at the center of the next computing revolution. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's dividend, currently yielding about 2.4%, isn't all that high. But it's superior to that of the average yield of stocks in the S&P 500, which yields less than 2%. Microsoft produces an incredible amount of free cash flow -- nearly $25 billion in fiscal 2016. This fueled not only $11 billion in dividend payments, putting the payout ratio at about 44%, but also $16 billion of share buybacks. There's still plenty of room to grow the dividend going forward, even without much earnings growth. Microsoft's cash-rich balance sheet is another reason the stock is attractive to dividend investors aiming to buy and hold for many years. Microsoft had net cash of $37.8 billion at the end of the latest quarter, providing a massive cushion that can sustain the dividend even in the roughest economic conditions. While there are higher-yielding stocks available, Microsoft is a good option for long-term investors. Brian Feroldi (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): It is natural for income-focused investors to want to own stocks that offer up higher yields than the market in general. However, picking the right high-yield stocks can be tricky, since a massive payout can sometimes actually be a warning sign. One alternative that is available to all investors is to instead invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on dividend stocks with above-average yields. If that sounds like a smart way to go, then I'd suggest that you give the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF a closer look. This passively managed ETF owns more than 400 stocks that have higher yields than the market in general. Its biggest holdings are all names that investors are familiar with -- think Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson -- which also provides investors with an extra layer of stability. The VYM currently offers a dividend yield of 3%, which is more than 50% higher than that of the S&P 500 average yield. Better yet, this fund's 10-year total return -- which accounts for the reinvestment of dividends -- is neck and neck with the S&P 500. VYM Total Return Price data by YCharts. Despite all of its benefits, Vanguard only charges a minuscule 0.08% expense ratio to access this ETF. Thus, if you are after a high yield but don't want to pick individual stocks, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF could be an excellent choice for you. Dan Caplinger (ONEOK): The plunge in energy prices in 2015 hurt companies throughout the industry, and even midstream infrastructure plays like ONEOK took big hits in their share prices. Yet after losing 70% of its share price, ONEOK has surged in the past year, nearly tripling as investors have figured out that not all companies have the same exposure to crude oil prices as others. ONEOK has an impressive slate of infrastructure assets, helping in the gathering process of natural gas from the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-Continent regions of the U.S. and then processing, storing, and transporting it to key market centers in the energy industry. That business relies more on production volume than on price, and although the producers that ONEOK works with transport more natural gas when prices are favorable, the energy transportation giant has still been able to produce solid results as oil and natural gas prices have rebounded. ONEOK currently has a yield of 4.5%, but that figure should go up when the company completes its planned acquisition of its ONEOK Partners (NYSE:OKS) master limited partnership. Once the MLP deal is complete, ONEOK expects to boost dividends by a fifth, which should help the yield even further. As long as energy prices remain strong enough to induce its clients to send natural gas through its infrastructure network, ONEOK will be in position to keep delivering income to its investors. Matt DiLallo (Enterprise Products Partners): Pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has an excellent track record of paying investors an above-average dividend. In fact, since going public in 1998, the company has raised its payout 59 times, including in each of the past 50 quarters. These haven't been token increases, either, with its last payout representing a 5.1% raise over the prior year. All these increases have added up over the years, with the company currently yielding a very generous 5.8%. That payout is about as safe as they come. First of all, more than 85% of Enterprise's cash flow comes from fee-based service contracts, which provides it with very stable cash flow. Furthermore, the company pays out less than 80% of its cash flow, which is well below the near-100% payout ratios of the average MLP. Finally, the company has a top-notch balance sheet, evidenced by the fact it has one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs. Add it up, and Enterprise has the financial strength to maintain its distribution rather easily. That said, the company is more likely to maintain its distribution growth streak than simply keep things status quo. Fueling that growth potential is the fact that it has $6.7 billion of growth projects under construction and several additional projects under development. These new assets should enable the company to continue growing its cash flow, giving it more money to return to investors. Needless to say, this is one dividend stock that will not cause investors any worry. ","

145,Jeff Reeves,3162017,MarketWatch,3092017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data.

But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region.

So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general.

146, ,3232017,Reuters,3162017,"Imperial Oil Limited, incorporated on May 1, 1978, is an integrated oil company. The Company is engaged in all the phases of the petroleum industry in Canada, including exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas. The Company's operations are conducted in three segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. The Upstream operations include the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas, synthetic oil and bitumen. Downstream operations consist of the transportation and refining of crude oil, blending of refined products and the distribution and marketing of those products. The Chemical operations consist of the manufacturing and marketing of various petrochemicals. Upstream The Company is involved in the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas in Canada. The Company holds an interest in the Kearl oil sands project, a joint venture with ExxonMobil Canada Properties. The Kearl project recovers shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's Kearl's net bitumen production was approximately 118,000 barrels per day and gross production was approximately 120,000 barrels per day. The Company holds an interest in Syncrude, a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and upgrade it to produce a synthetic crude oil. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped to certain of the Company's refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's Syncrude's net production of synthetic crude oil was approximately 67,000 barrels per day and gross production was approximately 68,000 barrels per day. The Company's Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to certain of the Company's refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. As of December 31, 2016, net production at Cold Lake was approximately 138,000 barrels per day and gross production was approximately 161,000 barrels per day. The Company's production of liquids, bitumen and natural gas is derived from wells located in Canada. The Company's bitumen leases include approximately 194,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of approximately 34,000 net acres at Kearl.

If you invest for income, collecting your dividends is the most important thing. You don't care what's going on in an industry or what the outlook is for the stock market. You want to get paid on time and, preferably, with regular dividend hikes thrown in the mix, too. If that sounds like you, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are two dividends stocks you'll love. Enterprise Products Partners is one of the largest midstream oil and gas players in the country. It uses its network of pipes, storage, and processing facilities to get those fuels from where they are drilled to where they are used. Here's the interesting thing: The vast majority of its business is fee-based. That means volatile energy prices aren't that important to Enterprise -- only demand for its pipes and facilities. Image source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. This helps explain why the partnership has been able to increase its distribution for 50 consecutive quarters (the annual streak, just so you know, is up to 20 years). That includes right through the deep oil downturn that started in mid-2014. Enterprise has also managed to keep an average coverage ratio of around 1.2 times of late, providing a layer of safety for its distribution. Enterprise continues to invest for the future. It has roughly $6.7 billion worth of projects under construction today. Those projects will come online between now and 2019 and will support further distribution growth. This industry giant and its generous 6% (or so) distribution yield is a great option for dividend investors who hate risk. ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest integrated oil and natural gas companies, is another energy player that should be on the income short list. It has a roughly 3.7% dividend yield and, more importantly, it has increased its dividend every year for the past 34 years. You might highlight Chevron Corp.'s (NYSE:CVX) 29 years and 4% yield as a better deal, but there's more to a dividend increase than there appears. Exxon increased its dividend in the second quarters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Chevron increased its dividend in the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 -- it held the dividend steady for 10 quarters, two and a half years, in between. But because of timing, Chevron's annual dividend streak remained intact. Exxon's regular yearly increases are the better option if you don't like risk. EPD Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Exxon is one of the most conservative and best-run oil majors. For example, its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of around 15% is at the low end of the industry. Sure, it has added debt to maintain its capital spending and dividend through the oil downturn, like most of its peers, but it is still conservatively financed. On the operational front, it has long been among the industry's best performers on return on invested capital. This metric measures how well a company invests its shareholders' money. Regular dividend hikes backed by a solid balance sheet and a well-run company. That's the kind of stock risk-averse investors could love, particularly since the yield is currently toward the high end of the company's historical range. Stock prices go up and down -- all investors know that. Dividend investors, though, know that those price swings often open up opportunities in dividend stocks that keep on paying in good times and bad. If you can step back from the stock price and focus, instead, on the dividend, your risk equation changes, and price volatility suddenly becomes an opportunity to own great dividend payers like ExxonMobil and Enterprise Products Partners. If you hate risk, you can easily take solace in the regular distributions this pair has continued to pay and grow despite one of the worst energy downturns in recent history. ","

148,Lee Samaha,3232017,Fool,3162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The shocks to oil prices created by the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the revolution in Iran in 1979 had far reaching consequences that still affect investor thinking today. Analyzing the aftermath of the ensuing energy crisis and stagflation (high inflation with stagnant growth) leads to one key conclusion oil stock pickers need to be aware of: the demand for oil is not price inelastic. Price elasticity of demand simply means that as the price of a good goes up or down its demand will adjust accordingly -- usually as price goes down, demand goes up. Therefore, when oil perma-bulls make the commonly heard argument that oil demand is price inelastic, they are saying that as oil prices rise, demand will stay constant. Image source: Getty Images This is important because it implies that oil demand won't taper off and consumers won't start using alternatives -- a bullish argument for oil.However, the evidence from the aftermath of the energy crises is that demand, at least past the short-term, is actually price elastic. In other words, demand can go down as prices go up. As you can see below, oil prices dictate the direction of oil stocks. The chart shows oil prices alongside a leading energy ETF, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEMKT:XLE), which has ExxonMobile Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) as its largest holdings, along with a leading oil equipment and services ETF, the iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equip. (NYSEMKT:IEZ), which has Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) as its top two stocks. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Incidentally, there is a perfectly logical reason why oil services companies, like Schlumberger and Halliburton, should be more affected by spot oil price movements than oil exploration and production (E & P) companies (ExxonMobile and Chevron). Specifically, earnings at services companies are more dictated by near-term oil prices, which affect demand for oil field services, while E & P companies are better valued with their long-term oil reserves in the ground in mind, along with their exploration potential. The oil price shocks referenced above were dramatic by any measure. After adjusting for inflation, the Arab oil embargo crisis of 1973 saw oil prices jump from $20 to around $50 in no time -- an increase of 150% -- while the Iranian revolution led to an increase from around $55 to near $120 -- a near 120% increase. There are two arguments to suggest that the impact of these events had significant effects on demand. First, let's look at US motor vehicle fuel efficiency, a very important determinant of global oil demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates world oil demand in 2016 was 96.6 million barrels per day (mbpd), with the U.S. responsible for around 21%, and U.S. motor gasoline demand (9.3 mbpd) responsible for 9.6% of total world demand. The chart below shows how the crises spurred increases in fuel efficiency, with an inflexion in 1973 and a huge jump in 1979 -- evidence that higher oil prices will change thinking about fuel economy and reduce oil demand. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Logarithmic scale. The second chart shows energy inputs into electricity plants in the U.S. As you can see below, in 1971 oil products were the third largest contributor, but following the oil crises of the 1970s actions were taken to wean electricity production away from oil and toward coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Again, it's a demonstration of the fact that oil demand can readjust to higher prices -- oil products are pretty much irrelevant to U.S. electricity production now. Data source: International Energy Agency Headline Data. ktoe is kilotonne of oil equivalent The evidence from the actions taken following the energy crises suggests that oil demand isn't as price inelastic as many oil bulls may assume it to be -- a key concern if you are pricing in significant oil price increases in future. Moreover, given the importance of U.S. gasoline demand, and the fact that 70% of petroleum in the U.S. has been used for transportation in recent years, what happens to global oil demand if the U.S. embarks on a wide-scale shift to energy-efficient electric vehicles? Even if you are bullish on oil in the long-term -- and there is a case for emerging markets to propel demand -- it might make sense to balance risk by investing in stocks that benefit from trends like electrification of vehicles and the use of natural gas.

153,John Bromels,8312017,Fool,8242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","
      
    What Hurricane Harvey Means for Oil Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

155,Philip van Doorn,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

                                   which was established in December 2014 and invests in derivatives so that the fund’s value will go up when S&P 500 companies raise their dividends. Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

162,Philip van Doorn,8312017,MarketWatch,8242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions. Darren Woods took over the top job at Exxon Mobil Corp.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

163,,9282017,Reuters,9212017,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp vastly expanded its presence in Brazil on Wednesday, winning 10 blocks in the country’s 14th round of bidding for oil exploration and production rights, helping the cash-strapped nation fetch a record 3.8 billion reais ($1.19 billion). Exxon Mobil took six blocks in consortia with state-controlled oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro in the promising offshore Campos basin, after bidding 2.24 billion reais for one block. That was Brazil’s highest-ever such bid. The U.S. company prior to the auction was among the few oil majors without a presence in the exploration of the recently discovered large offshore fields in Brazil. Exxon Mobil also bought two blocks that it will operate on its own in the Campos basin, which abuts Brazil’s pre-salt area where hydrocarbons are trapped under a layer of salt below the ocean floor. It won a further two blocks in the Sergipe-Alagoas basin that it will develop with Queiroz Galvão Exploração e Produção (QGEP) and Murphy Oil Corp. The results came as a surprise after Brazil’s oil regulator ANP managed to sell just one of 76 blocks on offer in the highly productive Santos basin by late morning. Analysts had said lackluster oil price performance and dwindling cash for investments might have dented appetite. But Exxon Mobil, which also made a record bid of 1.2 billion reais with Petrobras for a Campos block on Wednesday, helped Brazil achieve the record take. Exxon said in a statement that it was looking forward to working with the Brazilian government and other partners in operating the blocks they won.Asked after the auction why he spent so much on the bids, Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente said he had information suggesting the blocks were part of the pre-salt area, one of the world’s largest oil discoveries in recent decades. The auction was seen as a test of whether market-friendly reforms under President Michel Temer could tempt investors back to a sector struggling after years of state meddling and tarnished by a corruption scandal at Petrobras. In the last round, in December 2015, ANP raised just 121 million reais, as tough local content rules under Temer’s predecessor Dilma Rousseff discouraged major foreign companies from investing. Brazil on Wednesday sold just 37 of the areas on offer. Still, the country raised well over the 1.69 billion reais ($529.85 million) it expected had it placed all 287 onshore and offshore exploration blocks. Officials had said they expected to sell up to 40 percent of the blocks. Environmental activists protested the auction and threatened to invade the Rio de Janeiro hotel where the round was taking place. They were removed after scuffling with hotel security staff. Other winners included China’s CNOOC and Spain’s Repsol which took offshore blocks in the Espírito Santo basin with signing bonuses for 23.55 million reais ($7.38 million) and 23 million reais respectively. The auction was Brazil’s 14th round for blocks outside of the coveted pre-salt area and should gauge appetite for the country’s second and third pre-salt rounds next month. ","

Refiners and marketers are leading the advance, with several components ready to challenge their 2014 and 2015 rally highs. However, not all components have benefited equally from this uptick, as evidenced by Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), which is underperforming Dow rival Chevron Corporation (CVX) by a wide margin. The VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK) offers a partial industry view. The ETF came public in August 2015, months after the sector topped out, and fell into a downtrend. It broke out above 13-month resistance at $20.70 in December 2016 and entered a strong advance that has posted a series of new highs in the first three quarters of 2017. Buying intensity surged at the end of August, with two monster hurricanes providing the catalyst for much higher volatility levels. (See also: Refiners ETF Hits New 52-Week High.) Chevron Corporation (CVX) entered a strong uptrend following the 2008 economic collapse, breaking out to a new high in 2011 ahead of continued gains into the July 2014 all-time high at $135.10. The subsequent decline picked up ferocity in May 2015, dumping the stock to a five-year low at $69.58 in August, ahead of a recovery wave that topped out two points below the .786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement level at $121 in December 2016. A slow and steady pullback found support near $102 in June 2017, yielding two months of testing at that level, followed by a bounce that has almost reached last year's high. A breakout would set off a number of buying signals that favor a quick surge into the 2014 high. Market players can buy that rally, taking an aggressive exit at resistance or holding on tight in anticipation of a larger-scale breakout that posts all-time highs. (For more, see: Behind Chevron's 71% Rise in 10 Years.) Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) topped out at an all-time high above $78 in July 2007 following a multi-year uptrend and sold off to $13.94 during the bear market. The stock has spent the past eight years working its way back to the prior decade's peak, stalling within five points of that level in November 2015 and dropping into a volatile correction that ended at an 18-month low in the upper $40s in June 2016. A bounce into January 2017 stalled within four points of the 2015 high, giving way to a decline that found support at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in June. It surged higher off that low, mounting the January high and finally reaching the 2015 high, which is now being tested. A breakout should allow the stock to complete the round trip into the 2007 high, while completing the final stage of a massive cup and handle breakout pattern that targets the triple digits. (See also: Valero Energy to Process More Crude Amid Strong Gasoline Demand.) Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) came public at $19.00 in June 2011 and entered a choppy sideways pattern, ahead of a September 2012 breakout that unfolded in a volatile uptrend. The stock topped out at $60.38 in July 2015, built a double top at that level and broke down in January 2016, dumping to a three-year low at $29.24 in February. A rapid recovery off that low stalled within six points of 2015 resistance in January 2017. A pullback into the second quarter found willing buyers in the upper $40s, while a bounce into August reversed just two points above the January high. Subsequent selling pressure dried up at range support and the 200-day EMA a few weeks later, yielding a fresh rally attempt that is now setting its sights on the third quarter high. Meanwhile, on-balance volume (OBV) has lifted to an all-time high, raising the odds for a multi-year breakout that targets the $80s.

At The Motley Fool, we're all about long-term investing. We love stocks that have the potential to create value through growth or dividends years and decades into the future. We asked three of our investors which companies are built to last for the very, very long term -- 50 years -- and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) were at the top of the list. Image source: Getty Images. Rich Smith (ExxonMobil): As I specialize in space investing, I spend a lot of time thinking (way) outside the box. So when I tell you that I think ExxonMobil is a stock worth considering as an investment for the next 50 years, I hope you'll bear with me for a moment. There's been a lot of talk lately about mining the Moon for helium, for example, and digging deep into Mars in search of buried water reserves. Farther down the road, expeditions to the Jovian moons of Europa or Ganymede might require mining deep below the moons' icy surfaces, through subsurface oceans and into the seafloor below. Now, what company comes to mind when you think of digging in icy terrain and drilling beneath oceans? To me, the first name that pops is Siberian and deep-sea driller ExxonMobil. That's why I have a strong suspicion that even if Earth's oil resources are ultimately tapped out (or rendered obsolete by electric cars), there's a future for ExxonMobil stock -- out there among the stars. Travis Hoium (Alphabet): The next 50 years will likely see even more disruption than the last 50 years, so I want to own companies that have disruptive innovation built into their DNA. Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, pushing to profoundly change everything from transportation to healthcare. Alphabet's core is the Google search and advertising business that's around us every day. Google touches nearly every corner of the internet and even powers the smartphones hundreds of millions of people have in their pockets. And its base is an incredibly profitable free cash flow machine: GOOG Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. On top of the steady moneymaking business is a company that invests in nearly every revolutionary technology being developed today. Waymo is developing self-driving vehicles, Nest is making smart thermostats and security systems, Google Fiber and Project Loon are bringing high-speed internet to the world, and Google's investment arms have stakes in companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Slack. Not all of these bets will pay off, but the ones that do could drive the next generation of growth for Alphabet. In a fairly short period of time as a public company (a little over a decade), Alphabet has shown the ability to grow its core business and adapt to new technologies that will shape the world for decades to come. Few companies are prepared for the next phase of transformative innovation like Alphabet is. No matter what the world looks like in 50 years, I bet Alphabet will play a big role in the technology we use every day. Dan Caplinger (NVR): The population of the U.S. continues to rise, and demand for housing remains strong. NVR is just one of many homebuilders in the stock market, but the company uses an unusual business model that has given it the ability to weather difficulties in the industry that other homebuilders have suffered from more extensively. NVR's competitive edge comes largely from the way it secures land for development. Many developers choose to buy land outright well in advance of building homes on it; that not only requires them to put up a lot of money up front but also leaves them exposed to downturns in the real estate market. Instead, NVR obtains options to purchase land at a future date, exercising its rights on a lot-by-lot basis, in many instances just before making a sale. The strategy does require NVR to spend extra money to secure the options to purchase, but if something happens with the real estate market, the company can simply walk away without exercising the option, limiting its losses to the amount it paid for the option. In the eight years since the financial crisis, NVR has seen its profits quadruple, and investors are excited about the future. Whether the housing market thrives or slides, NVR is in one of the best positions possible to deliver strong returns to its shareholders. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years -- The Motley Fool

167,Reuben Gregg Brewer,9282017,Fool,9212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investing in a high-yield stock isn't worth it if the dividend winds up getting cut. The fat yield, in that case, was little more than an illusion. The energy industry has been plagued by this phenomenon in recent years, as exemplified by Kinder Morgan's 75% 2016 dividend cut or ENI's nearly 30% cut in 2015. But there are no magic tricks taking place at 6.4%-yielding Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) or 3.8%-yielding ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). They are two of the safest high-yield dividends stocks in the energy space backed by long, and still intact, annual dividend growth streaks. Enterprise, an oil and natural gas midstream limited partnership, sports the higher yield of this pair. That's not surprising since the partnership structure is specifically designed to pass income through to unitholders. But it's worth noting that the 6.4% yield is backed by 20 consecutive years' worth of distribution increases, with an average annual increase of about 5%. So it has both an impressive yield and an impressive record of slow and steady distribution growth. Image source: Getty Images. Enterprise is one of the largest and most diversified midstream players. It is continuing to invest for the future, with roughly $9 billion in growth investments in the works right now. That will help the partnership keep increasing the distribution in the years ahead. And Enterprise is conservatively run, with distribution coverage of 1.2 times providing a nice margin of safety for yield seekers. But one of the most exciting pieces of data here is that, even during the worst of the oil downturn that started in mid-2014, Enterprise's core distributable cash flow continued to head slowly higher. In other words, it was able to keep growing its largely fee-based business right through an energy industry rough patch while rewarding unitholders with distribution increases and solid distribution coverage of at least 1.2 times. If you're looking for a high and safe yield, you need to put Enterprise on your list -- even if you aren't focused on the energy patch. Another energy company you should be looking at for a safe high yield is integrated energy major ExxonMobil. The company has increased its dividend for an incredible 35 years despite operating in a commodity business prone to volatile price swings. The average annualized increase over the past decade was nearly 9%, around three times the historical rate of inflation growth. That said, it didn't sail through the recent oil downturn nearly as well as Enterprise. But that's actually one of the reasons to like Exxon more than its integrated energy peers, most of which have higher leverage ratios. XOM Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly) data by YCharts. When oil prices started to collapse in mid-2014, Exxon's top and bottom lines took a big hit. But it continued to invest in its business and increase the dividend anyway. It did that by cutting costs and adding leverage to its balance sheet (cost-cutting and increasing debt was the basic tactic for all the energy majors). But here's the interesting thing: Despite long-term debt increasing from roughly $7 billion in 2013 to nearly $29 billion in 2016, Exxon is still one of the least-leveraged oil majors. Basically it , sed its strong balance sheet to power through the energy downturn, which is exactly what you want to see. The key, however, is that even after all that additional leverage, long-term debt still only makes up about 12% of the capital structure -- an industry-leading metric. EPD Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts. The improving energy market, meanwhile, has allowed Exxon to again cover its dividend and capital spending plans, and given it enough breathing room to pay down $4 billion in long-term debt through the first half of the year. There are integrated oil majors with higher yields, but none stacks up to Exxon's financial strength and dividend history. You can find energy companies with yields higher than Enterprise or Exxon relatively easily. But the mix of dividend safety and high yield that each of these industry giants offers is a lot harder to come by. Both have proven their mettle and commitment to investors through long, uninterrupted streaks of annual dividend increases and their astute management through the recent, and deep, oil downturn. And with Enterprise and Exxon both offering relatively high yields today, these stocks could be prime portfolio candidates if you're looking for safe, high-yield dividend investments. ","

",Why it pays to take a second look at this year’s worst-performing Dividend Aristocrat stocks - MarketWatch,0.9984
169,,10052017,Reuters,9282017,"RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s big bet on Brazil’s offshore Campos basin shows its willingness to pay up to replenish its reserves and may pave the way for hefty bids in October auctions in the country’s rich pre-salt areas, analysts said. Marking a return to Brazilian exploration after a five-year absence, Exxon took eight blocks in the coveted basin, one of Brazil’s most productive, at an auction on Wednesday. Six were taken in partnership with state-run Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras). The auction’s record take included an Exxon bid of 2.24 billion reais ($704 million) for one block, Brazil’s highest-ever such bid. That showed how oil companies that can afford significant overheads are willing to shell out for and develop high quality reserves in far-flung locations, despite oil prices that have roughly halved since 2014. “If anyone can bring a low-cost approach to doing something as big and complex as that, it is probably Exxon Mobil,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones. Youngberg said he also expects Exxon to be involved in October auctions of blocks in the adjoining pre-salt area, where hydrocarbons are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor. Exxon did not immediately respond to a question about its potential participation in the October auctions. Exxon, with a market value of around $350 billion, has spent heavily this year on oil and natural gas expansion projects to replenish its diminishing reserves, seeking to counteract concerns that it is falling behind peers in exploration and production. Investments have included the Permian Basin in the United States, offshore Guyana, and Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale play. The Brazil deal is a “further sign of the company’s urgency to replenish its resources base,” analysts at Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co said on Thursday, adding that the Campos Basin deal was a bullish sign for Brazil’s pre-salt block auctions. Wednesday’s record bid was around 5 times as much as the nearest one from Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol. Petrobras said it had information that some of the Campos blocks had high-potential pre-salt reserves. Before the auction, Exxon was among the few oil majors without an exploration presence in Brazil’s recently discovered large offshore fields. “For Exxon Mobil, a lack of presence in Brazil’s pre-salt has been arguably the biggest gap in its portfolio, especially now that Shell holds a dominant position in this prolific, relatively low-breakeven play,” Horacio Cuenca, a researcher at Wood Mackenzie, said in a client statement. Exxon abandoned drilling efforts in the nearby Santos basin in 2012 following disappointing results. But a series of policy changes under market-friendly President Michel Temer, including a reduction of requirements that forced foreign businesses to use local partners, will likely tempt investors to return to Latin America’s no.1 economy, analysts said.

170, ,10052017,CNBC,9282017,"Oil prices fell about 3 percent on Friday, as a week of profit-taking and the return of oversupply concerns led the market lower, snapping a multi-week bull run. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 2.95 percent, settling at $49.29, breaking a four week win streak. It closed down nearly 4.5 percent in the worst performing week since March 10. The prospect of extended oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia had supported prices on Thursday. But on Friday Russia clarified remarks on the oil market made by President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, saying he did not propose extending a global oil output cut deal but said he recognized it was a possibility. ""Yesterday we had Russia and the Saudis talking about extending cooperation, and today we saw a little bit of backtracking with respect to additional cuts in production."" said Houston-based consultant Andrew Lipow. ""What the market gained yesterday is clearly being given back today."" Saudi Arabia's energy minister said on Thursday he was ""flexible"" about prolonging the production-curbing pact until the end of 2018. However, concerns linger about growing U.S. crude exports, incentivised by a hefty WTI discount to Brent prices. ""We have a couple of bearish factors like a new record for U.S. crude exports, the reopening of Libya's biggest oilfield, a new year high in U.S. crude production and the recent strength of the U.S. dollar,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW in Stuttgart. A stronger dollar also led to further losses in the oil market on Friday. The dollar hit a 10-week high after data showing the largest gain in U.S. wages since December 2016 bolstered bets on an interest rate hike by year-end. ""I expect Brent to drop below $55 a barrel and WTI below $50 in the next couple of days,"" Schallenberger said. U.S. government data showed this week that crude exports had risen to a record of nearly 2 million barrels per day. Analysts told CNBC they expect the export levels to remain elevated in the coming weeks. Futures held their losses after oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported the number of oil rigs operating in U.S. fields fell by 2 in the latest week. The rig count stood at 748, compared with 428 at this time last year. Investors were watching tropical storm Nate's impact on some oil production in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of its expected arrival in the area as a hurricane on Sunday. ""The biggest impact (from Nate) could be on gasoline prices, depending on how many refineries are forced to shut down. But I don't think we will see another bull run,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW in Stuttgart. In the Gulf of Mexico, BP and Chevron were shutting production at all platforms, while Royal Dutch Shell and Anadarko Petroleum suspended some activity. Exxon Mobil, Statoil and other producers have withdrawn personnel. ",Oil set to end multi-week bull run as oversupply concerns resurface,-0.8968
172,Reuben Gregg Brewer,10052017,Fool,9282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Oil prices peaked at over $100 a barrel in mid-2014 and then fell sharply to around $30 a barrel in January of 2016. Although prices have rebounded since that low, they remain range bound at about half the previous highs. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has rolled with the punches, though, continuing to reward shareholders with annual dividend hikes. That's a testament to its conservative culture and diversified business. If volatile energy prices have you wondering how risky ExxonMobil is, well, here are some key facts you'll want to know. Exxon is an integrated energy company. That means it has operations across the industry, including drilling, refining, and chemicals. This is notable because oil prices affect each of these business differently. Specifically, downstream businesses like refining and chemicals can actually benefit from lower input costs (essentially falling oil prices). Image source: Getty Images. This dynamic was on clear display in 2015 when the drilling business saw earnings decline roughly 75% as oil prices fell. That same year, though, earnings in the downstream businesses more than doubled, largely because oil prices were declining. The improvement in the downstream business' earnings wasn't enough to offset all of the pain from falling oil prices, but it certainly helped to soften the blow. Exxon isn't the only energy company with a mix of upstream and downstream assets. But this diversification sets the stage for a very stable business. The next important fact is that Exxon is one of the least leveraged energy majors. That said, if you read the news, you'll know that Exxon added a lot of debt during the energy downturn. There's no denying that fact; between 2013 and 2016, long-term debt increased from roughly $7 billion to almost $29 billion. That's a massive increase. XOM Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly) data by YCharts. But step back for a second. During the downturn, all of the energy majors cut costs and added debt to support their businesses. Exxon was no different in this regard. However, Exxon happens to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with debt making up only about 15% of its capital structure at the end of 2016, even after adding all of that debt. And Exxon is already starting to pay its debt off, cutting long-term debt by over $4 billion through the first six months of 2017. The thing is, this is exactly what you want to see management do -- use its rock-solid balance sheet to smooth out the ups and downs of the volatile energy industry. Clearly, adding that much debt isn't good, but the fact that Exxon has the flexibility to do so is a very good thing. The last fact up is Exxon's dividend, which has been increased every year for 35 consecutive years. That's a streak unrivaled in the volatile energy business and shows that Exxon believes in rewarding shareholders in good years and bad. But there's a little more to this story, too. For example, you can argue that Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) has an equally impressive streak of 29 years going. But during the oil downturn, Chevron's dividend stood at $1.07 a share for 10 consecutive quarters. That's two and a half years. The annual increase streak only stayed alive because Chevron traditionally increases its dividend in the middle of the year. In other words, it was a timing issue. (Some of the other oil majors ended up cutting their dividends, by the way.) XOM Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Exxon actually increased its dividend every single year. This doesn't necessarily make the business any safer, but it certainly makes it easier for investors to stick around through the hard times. The oil and natural gas business is an inherently volatile one, driven by often swift and dramatic commodity price moves. That's not likely to change anytime soon. However, Exxon's diversified business helps to offset that volatility as some divisions will benefit when others are likely to be suffering. That's layered on top of a balance sheet that provides a foundation solid enough to weather even the strongest gales. And investors, like me, get to benefit as the company continues to reward us with a steadily rising dividend -- a statement that management believes this company is set to thrive in any market. How risky is ExxonMobil? Not nearly as risky as you might think for a company in the oil business. ","

In a previously unscheduled public appearance Wednesday, Tillerson called Trump “smart” and said he had never talked out of resigning because of disagreements with the president. NBC reported that a frustrated Tillerson called Trump a “moron” in a meeting with Pentagon officials in mid-July. He was also supposedly talked out of resigning by Vice President Mike Pence. To quell a budding controversy, Tillerson interrupted his schedule to make a short statement to the media. He denied the NBC report about Pence, but he declined to address whether he called Trump a “moron.” Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp.

The administration was beset by resignations and firings at the time, and officials were concerned about potential fallout from the departure of such a high-level cabinet member in the first year of Trump’s presidency. Tensions appeared to be reignited last weekend when Tillerson said the U.S. was attempting to find a diplomatic solution to the armed standoff with North Korea.

                                   has been dethroned as the world’s top energy company, according to the 2017 S&P Global Platts rankings. Charles Hugh Smith, in a post on the Daily Reckoning blog, used this troubling chart to explain how “the Achilles Heel of our socio-economic system is the secular stagnation of earned income, i.e. wages and salaries.” As you can see, there’s been a long and steady decline: “Stagnating wages undermine every aspect of our economy: consumption, credit, taxation and perhaps most importantly, the unspoken social contract that the benefits of productivity and increasing wealth will be distributed widely, if not fairly,” Hugh Smith writes. He explains that, given the gravity of the consequences of the trend, economists have been trying to figure it out. They have been citing factors such as automation, globalization/offshoring, the high cost of housing, a decline of corporate competition, a failure of our educational complex to keep pace, stagnating gains in productivity, and so on. “Each of these dynamics may well exacerbate the trend,” Hugh Smith says, “but they all dodge the dominant driver of wage stagnation and rise income-wealth inequality: Our economy is optimized for financialization, not labor/earned income.” He put the blame squarely on the Fed. “Pushing inflation higher while wages stagnate can be charitably called insane,” he writes. “Less charitably, it’s evil, as it strips purchasing power and wealth from all whose income isn’t keeping pace with central bank-engineered inflation.” “You can’t survive a market crash if you think it can’t happen” — Jason Zweig, in his WSJ piece, “Will you be ready when the stock market crashes again?” The number everybody will be focusing on this week is the September jobs report, as hurricanes could make it look like the U.S. lost jobs for the first time since 2010. But that doesn’t hit until Friday. In the meantime, we’ll get construction spending for August at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday. Also of note, Tuesday will bring car sales for September, with analysts expecting a nice little bump from August. 17.9% — That’s how much NFL ticket sales have dropped from the prior week amid the knee-taking anthem protests, according to the Washington Examiner. “We have seen a massive decrease in NFL ticket purchases this past week in comparison to years past,” TickPick’s Jack Slingland said.

Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Boeing is running into trouble this week and now faces a critical technical test, according to one technician. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks.

177,Tom DiChristopher,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"Saudi Aramco's plan to take a portion of its business public next year remains on track, the oil giant's chief executive Amin Nasser told CNBC in an exclusive interview. Nasser made his comments Sunday following recent reports that the initial public offering for the world's largest energy company could be delayed into 2019 or shelved in favor of selling private shares to sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Aramco has tried to swat down those rumors, and Nasser denied the reports again in an interview with ""Squawk Box""in the command center at Saudi Aramco headquarters in Dhahran. ""We have always said that we will be listing in 2018, and to be more specific, in the second half of 2018,"" he said. ""However, I think journalists and writers — they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the IPO and all of that."" ""The IPO is on track. The listing venue will be discussed and shared in due course,"" Nasser added. Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, plans to list its shares on the Saudi domestic stock market, the Tadawul, and one or more foreign exchanges. However, it has yet to choose the overseas market, fueling speculation about the kingdom's plans. The Financial Times reported last month that China was emerging as a front-runner in the possible plan to delay the IPO and sell shares to sovereign wealth funds. Asked directly about the report, Nasser denied it. ""Saudi Aramco are not talking, as I said, to the Chinese or others,"" he said. ""All of that analysis is being reviewed in detail ... to make a decision at a certain stage, and we're not going to be pushed, you know, by a journalist saying this needs to be talked about or not."" The IPO for roughly 5 percent of the company is widely expected to be the largest in history. Saudi officials have said Aramco could attract a $2 trillion valuation, though others forecast the offering will value the company at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. In any case, investment banks tapped to handle the transaction stand to reap a huge windfall. The share sale is also critical to Saudi Arabia's economic future. The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to diversify the nation's economy through a plan called ""Vision 2030."" Nasser believes Saudi Aramco is at the heart of that plan and the kingdom's transformation. He said the IPO will facilitate key initiatives to grow private business' share of the economy, create more small- and medium-sized enterprises, boost industrialization and employment and encourage women to join the workforce. Some fund managers recently told CNBC their concerns about the IPO include minority shareholder rights, the transparency of oil reserves, the viability of fossil fuels and how the Saudis will balance national priorities and their duty to shareholders. Saudi oil revenues have historically funded its social spending, a critical aspect of its pact to provide for its citizens and its large royal family. That pact is seen as the key to maintaining relative stability in a region rocked by social upheaval in recent years. Nasser predicted it will be easy to convey to investors how Saudi Aramco's focus on long-term planning has allowed the company to drive past results. He believes the interests of its sole current shareholder — the government — and its future investors are aligned. ""I think both are looking for results,"" he said. ""Both are going to be looking for a better performance, and I don't see any issues between our current shareholder and the public that will be participating when we are listed because ultimately we need to deliver better results."" Nasser also addressed the issue of transparency. Some investors have questioned Saudi oil reserves, which have remained roughly constant at about 260 billion to 265 billion barrels since 1989. Saudi Aramco has kept up a robust exploration program, even through the three-year oil price downturn, allowing it to add to its reserves, according to Nasser. He promised that Saudi Aramco will ""meet all the requirements of that market in terms of reserve assessment"" and other rules of the country where it chooses to list. Ultimately, Saudi Arabia is largely operating in line with its closest peers, the integrated international oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP, Nasser said. ""I can say Aramco has always been run like a publicly traded company,"" he said. ""If you look at our governance, we have independent board members. Everything that has been done in the company is similar to any international oil company in terms of the way we do business."" Iran needs economic ties to the rest of the world as the Trump administration plans sanctions on Iranian oil exports starting in November. For Iran one nation matters more than any other, and it is Trump's largest global trade rival: China. China has powerful non-tariff measures it can use to crush America  from cashing out its $1 trillion hoard of U.S. Treasury bonds to devaluing the yuan. These are measures that could destabilize the U.S. economy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has one big weakness in his master plan to dominate the world stage: an aging oil economy that lacks innovation and globally competitive sectors. After years of easy credit and go-go growth powered by China's technology gold rush, the country is now struggling with weakened investment and increasing corporate and local government defaults.

Income investors who take a quick look at Royal Dutch Shell plc's (NYSE:RDS-B) 6% dividend yield might be tempted to think it offers a better value than ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) with its 3.7% yield. There are good things taking shape at each of these integrated oil majors -- but when you look past the dividend yield, Exxon appears to be the better value. Here's why. During the worst of the oil downturn that started in mid-2014, Shell agreed to acquire BG Group. That move, which cost roughly $50 billion, helped increase the company's debt level by over 50% in 2016. Investors were clearly concerned, pushing shares down to the lowest price to tangible book value ratio they had seen in a decade at the start of 2017. Image source: Getty Images But Shell has been working quickly to reduce that debt, having already agreed to or completed the sale of $25 billion worth of assets (out of a $30 billion target). And its return on invested capital, which has been hampered over the years by large profile misses like arctic drilling, has started to move higher too. Management believes it can get that number up to 10%, even if oil prices are in the $60 a barrel range. That's a higher return than Shell managed between 2013 and 2016, when oil averaged $90 a barrel. Add in oil prices that have solidified in the $50 a barrel range and investor concerns about Shell appear to have waned. The company's price to tangible book value is back up toward the top of the range it has traded in for most of the past decade. I wouldn't call it expensive, per se, but it appears to be fairly valued at present. Bottom line: investors have clearly already rewarded Shell for the improvements it's made. Then there's Exxon, which, despite the lower yield, could offer income investors a better value proposition. This energy giant's price to tangible book value, for example, is up from its lows but still near the lowest levels of the past decade. That might make you think that Exxon is struggling to deal with headwinds that Shell has easily surmounted. But that's not the case. XOM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts For example, Exxon took on debt during the downturn to support its dividend and capital spending, as most oil majors did. However, it didn't take on a giant acquisition like Shell. Repairing the balance sheet, which remains quite strong despite the added leverage, isn't as worrying an issue. Meanwhile, Exxon has long been an industry leader when it comes to return on invested capital. It has proven year in and year out that it is among the best-run oil companies in the world. Yes, returns took a hit during the energy downturn, but like Shell they are starting to turn higher again. Note in the graph below that Exxon's returns remain higher than Shell's even today. RDS.B Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts And then there's the future. Exxon has two sizable catalysts for production growth:  the Permian Basin in the United States and an offshore field in Guyana. These opportunities don't appear to be priced into Exxon's valuation today. Exxon's yield may be materially lower than Shell's, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Exxon has long been one of the best operators in the oil business, has a solid balance sheet, and has notable production growth opportunities ahead of it. But investors remain unimpressed. Meanwhile, investors have rewarded Shell for its efforts to dig itself out of a balance sheet hole and for improving its lagging capital investment results. That's not to suggest that Shell is a bad company or even a bad investment: if you are searching for a high yield, it appears fairly valued today. But if you want a high yield and a good value, Exxon looks like the better opportunity right now. ","
      
    2 Reasons Exxon Mobil Corporation Is a Better Value Stock than Royal Dutch Shell plc -- The Motley Fool

180,Philip van Doorn,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 3:46 p.m. ET A measure called return on corporate capital is revealing — and there’s a free investor tool for research By Ever since stocks were first bought and sold, investors have sought to find company metrics that would separate the winners from the losers. Sales growth, earnings growth, earnings per share — even CEO pay. Now it turns out that companies that are good at deploying capital to produce quality goods and services represent lower risk and a higher likelihood of long-term stock gains. We examined this phenomenon two years ago, tying high returns on invested capital (ROIC) to excellent stock performance over very long periods. The data were provided by FactSet, which defines ROIC as a company’s net income divided by total invested capital (total shareholders’ equity and long-term debt). The idea of ROIC is to measure how efficiently a company’s managers use the money they have raised. At that time, Gary Lutin, a former investment banker at Lutin & Co. who oversees the Shareholder Forum in New York, said long-term investors who wanted to invest some of their money in individual stocks also needed to think about the products and services being sold by the companies and consider whether they would remain competitive for up to 20 years. Lutin & Co. invests only in non-publicly-traded companies, so as not to interfere with Lutin’s work at the Shareholder Forum, which works to provide “fair access to information that can be relied upon by both corporate and investor decision-makers,” and receives financial support from professional investors. Free data The Shareholder Forum on Oct. 20 rolled out a new calculation called return on corporate capital (ROCC). That can be useful for investors because the data are available for free and are calculated in a uniform manner using GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) data from SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) filings. Definitions of ROIC vary, and some companies even calculate ROIC using adjusted earnings numbers. But ROCC is calculated the same way for every company, using annual data: Net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. The idea is that if a company consistently generates high returns on corporate capital, good things will eventually happen. A focus on the company’s main business, rather than financial engineering through share buybacks or on adjusted earnings figures, means real profits are rolling in at high levels relative to investment. That eventually can be expected to support higher share prices, as the profits feed organic expansion, acquisitions or other things that are good for shareholders. The example of Valeant Evan Tindell, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bireme Capital, said ROCC enables investors to “look at the absolutely unadjusted figures.” He cited Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

                                   as a company that “consistently” focuses on adjusted figures in its earnings releases. For example, Valeant reported a GAAP net loss of $38 million for the second quarter, but adjusted earnings of $362 million, after making adjustments for amortization, asset impairments restructuring and other times. Wall Street analysts’ estimates are based on projected adjusted earnings per share. Valeant’s average ROCC over the past five fiscal years has been 1.8%, compared with 8.7% for its industry group, according the “real” GAAP numbers used by the Shareholder Forum. In an interview on Oct. 17, Lutin pointed out that ROCC comparisons are a sound foundation for analysis but should be considered only the starting point. Some companies, such as Amazon.com Inc.

That looks like a low figure, but for investors, the Amazon story has been about rapid sales growth, dominance in internet retail and expansion into new areas of business. The low ROCC and the stock’s high price-to-earnings ratio — 125.7 times consensus 2018 earnings estimates — may mean this type of valuation will eventually become unsustainable.

                                   for example, you can see the company’s average ROCC is 26.2%. The ROCC tool uses Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) from companies’ SEC filings to determine industry groups. These company-specified classifications are not always the best reflection of their current business, so you may have to make your own comparisons of companies in similar industries. For example, with 3M, you can see its ROCC greatly exceeds that of its industry group. The problem is that the industry group is “surgical and medical instruments,” when this industry represents only one of 3M’s five industry groups. If we look at the S&P 500’s industrial sector, there are seven companies that FactSet classifies as industrial conglomerates. Here are the five-year average ROCC figures for the group, along with their five-year total returns: You can see that for this industry group, the one with the best ROCC over the past five years didn’t have the best total return.

John Maynard Keynes famously described the stock market as a beauty contest in his 1936 book, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” to explain price fluctuations in equity markets. What he meant was that investors were trying to determine which stocks would be most attractive to other investors. “Speculating on what other people will find beautiful is a fool’s game,” Lutin said. “It’s a lot easier, and a whole lot safer, to pick a company that generates good returns by producing goods and services. A sound business foundation is also likely to continue its value a lot longer than today’s beauty.” Here are five-year average returns on corporate capital for the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average

A whopping 87.61, which is higher than 99.999% of all readings going back to 1900, according to Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners. In fact, only eight trading days since then (out of 30,914) have registered a higher reading on the blue-chip index. As if you needed another, but this sounds like a good reason to bail. Bilello, in our call of the day, says, however, if you sold every other time the RSI hit such an excessive number, you’d have missed out on some solid returns. At least over the short term. “In the year following extreme overbought readings, the Dow has actually been higher roughly 70% of the time, with an average price return of 14.2%,” Bilello explains in a blog post. “From five days forward through one year forward, the average returns and odds of a positive returns are higher than any random day.” Of course, he pointed out that these are just historical trends — trends that will almost certainly reverse the minute you decide to follow them. That’s the rub of timing the market. Still, the next time somebody tells you how risky and overbought this stock market is, go ahead and shove this graphic in their face: “If one is going to predict anything based on extreme overbought conditions (and I would advise against doing so), it would be further gains,” Bilello says. “I realize that doesn’t conform to the conventional narrative of ‘overbought = bearish,’ but the truth in markets rarely does.” Today’s truth: More record highs?

We can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop” — economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. He said those words back long before cryptocurrencies were a thing, but bitcoin fans recently trotted that out on Reddit as their investment continues to push deeper and deeper into record territory. See:  A bigger blast-off? What one strategist sees taking bitcoin ‘into the stratosphere’ And check out: The ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ says ICOs are ‘the biggest scam ever’ This chart “shows the power of human ingenuity, the benefits of long-term optimism, innovation, and progress in the business world,” says Ben Carlson of the Wealth of Common Sense blog. It also shows how the 22% implosion of the 1987 crash, which turned 30 years old last week, is nothing more than a hiccup in the long-term. “The standard lesson most investors try to show from all of this is that thinking long-term and ignoring the noise means everything will work out just fine,” Carlson says. “This is generally good advice but it’s also extremely naive.” Naive in that actually living through such drawdowns is completely different than reading about them ... or observing them in a chart. It can have a debilitating impact on how you navigate markets. “I’m still not sold on the idea that those who did experience the 1987 crash are better investors for it,” Carlson writes. “Some people who go through this type of market turbulence are always waiting for it to happen again. I’ve seen plenty of this following the 2008 financial crisis. Experience can help in the markets, but it can also work against you when you’re constantly fighting the last war.” Read: 3 money managers who lived through the 1987 stock-market crash warn of danger today Tesla

182,,11022017,Investopedia,10262017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. The model for MLR, given n observations, is: yi = B0 + B1xi1 + B2xi2 + ... + Bpxip + E where i = 1,2, ..., n A simple linear regression is a function that allows an analyst or statistician to make predictions about one variable based on the information that is known about another variable. Linear regression can only be used when one has two continuous variables – an independent variable and a dependent variable. The independent variable is the parameter that is used to calculate the dependent variable or outcome. For example, an analyst may want to know how the movement of the market affects the price of Exxon Mobil (XOM). In this case, his linear equation will have the value of S&P 500 index as the independent variable or predictor, and the price of XOM as the dependent variable. In reality, there are multiple factors that predict the outcome of an event. The price movement of Exxon Mobil, for example, depends on more than just the performance of the overall market. Other predictors such as the price of oil, interest rates, and the price movement of oil futures can affect the price of XOM and stock prices of other oil companies. To understand a relationship in which more than two variables are present, a multiple linear regression is used. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to determine a mathematical relationship among a number of random variables. In other terms, MLR examines how multiple independent variables are related to one dependent variable. Once each of the independent factors have been determined to predict the dependent variable, the information on the multiple variables can be used to create an accurate prediction on the level of effect they have on the outcome variable. The model creates a relationship in the form of a straight line (linear) that best approximates all the individual data points. The model for multiple linear regression is: yi = B0 + B1xi1 + B2xi2 + ... + Bpxip + E Where yi = dependent variable - price of XOM xi1 = independent variable – interest rates xi2 = independent variable – oil price xi3 = independent variable – value of S&P 500 index xi4= independent variable – price of oil futures E = random error in prediction, that is variance that cannot be accurately predicted by the model. Also known as residuals. B0 = y-intercept at time zero. B1 = regression coefficient that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi1 changes – change in XOM price when interest rates change B2 = coefficient value that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi2 changes – change in XOM price when oil prices change Etc. The least squares estimates, B0, B1, B2…Bp are usually computed by statistical software. As many variables can be included in the regression model in which each independent variable is differentiated with a number - 1,2, 3, 4...p. The multiple regression model allows an analyst to predict an outcome based on information provided on multiple explanatory variables. Still, the model is not always perfectly accurate as each data point can differ slightly from the outcome predicted by the model. The residual value, E, which is the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome, is included in the model to account for such slight variations. The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions: The co-efficient of determination, R-squared or R2, is a statistical metric that is used to measure how much of the variation in outcome can be explained by the variation in the independent variables. R2 always increases as more predictors are added to the MLR model even though the predictors may not related to the outcome variable. Therefore, R2 by itself, cannot be used to identify which predictors should be included in a model and which should be excluded. R2 can only be between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the outcome cannot be predicted by any of the independent variables and 1 indicates that the outcome can be predicted without error from the independent variables. Assuming we run our XOM price regression model through a statistics computation software that returns this output: An analyst would interpret this output to mean if other variables are held constant, the price of XOM will increase by 7.8% if the price of oil in the markets increases by 1%. The model also shows that the price of XOM will decrease by 1.5% following a 1% rise in interest rates. R2 indicates that 86.5% of the variations in the stock price of Exxon Mobil can be explained by changes in the interest rate, oil price, oil futures, and S&P 500 index.

When a company as big and diverse as General Electric (NYSE:GE) says publicly that it's considering reducing its dividend, it should give investors pause. GE was viewed as a Dividend Aristocrat for decades before the financial crisis but was working hard to get that title back. If conditions at GE are so dire that it needs to cut its dividend, then there must be other companies feeling similar pressure. The energy business isn't performing as well as GE hoped, and that should worry ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) investors as well. If you look at the company's performance over the past decade, it's becoming clear that its dividend could be in trouble, just like GE's. Image source: Getty Images. The oil business has become surprisingly difficult over the past decade as shale oil has flooded the market and OPEC has kept pumping oil and prices have remained low. Oil at $100 per barrel can be extremely profitable, but at $50, it isn't clear that many companies will make a solid return on investment. Below, I've put together a chart that shows ExxonMobil's deterioration over the past decade. Revenue and earnings are down, and return on assets has also plunged from the high teens to low single digits. XOM Revenue (TTM). Data by YCharts. Long term, I don't see how this trend won't get worse. Electric vehicles are now a very viable option for millions of consumers, and automakers are ramping up their manufacturing capacity. Even if just 10% of people start driving EVs, it'll crush oil markets. Remember, oil markets were only oversupplied by about 1% to 2% in 2014 when oil prices crashed from over $100 per barrel to the $30s. Electrifying the transportation fleet could have a much bigger impact on oil prices than that. Not only is performance deteriorating and the future looking cloudy, but ExxonMobil is already stretching itself thin on its dividend. Over the past decade, the company has been increasing its dividend, surpassing a 100% payout ratio, and taking out billions of debt in the process. XOM Dividends Paid (TTM). Data by YCharts. To put this plainly, ExxonMobil isn't generating enough net income from its normal operations to pay its growing dividend and is taking out debt to pay the current 4% yield. That's not sustainable over the long term. ExxonMobil is facing a lot of the same financial pressures as GE, and with EVs on the rise, its core oil business could be in serious trouble over the long run. With a payout ratio over 100% today, this is a dividend that I think should be cut sooner rather than later. Investors should beware buying this seemingly safe dividend stock. ","

187,Reuben Gregg Brewer,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The plunge in oil prices that started in mid-2014 forced integrated oil and natural gas giants ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell plc (NYSE:RDS-B) to retrench. Their financial results are finally starting to stabilize now that oil has been holding steadily in the $50-per-barrel range. However, they have been left with higher debt loads and a renewed outlook that includes range-bound oil prices for years to come. Which is the best buy today? One of the hangovers from the deep oil downturn is debt. All of the oil majors added leverage to their balance sheets so they could keep paying their distributions and fund planned capital expenditures. At the midpoint of 2017, Exxon had $4 billion in cash, with debt making up roughly 12% of its capital structure. That's a rock-solid balance sheet, but it's even more impressive when you consider that Exxon's debt is over three times larger than what it was at the start of 2014. Image source: Getty Images. By comparison, Chevron had cash of around $4.7 billion at mid-year, and long-term debt made up roughly 19% of the company's capital structure. Royal Dutch Shell, meanwhile, had $24 billion in cash, and long-term debt was nearly 30% of the capital structure. All three are working to deleverage today, but Exxon clearly has the strongest finances. Exxon is also one of the best-run oil majors when you look at return on capital employed. That basically examines how well a company uses its shareholders' money. The oil downturn led to return on capital employed falling for all of these companies. They're all starting to push the metric higher again now that oil prices appear to have stabilized. But it's the long-term view that matters here. Exxon isn't always tops on this metric, but it has historically beaten Shell and Chevron. Exxon wins here as well. XOM Return on Capital Employed (TTM) data by YCharts One place where Exxon isn't a clear winner is dividend yield. Exxon's yield is 3.7% today, compared with Chevron's 3.8% and Shell's 5.9%. However, Exxon can boast a 35-year streak of annual dividend increases. Shell's dividend has been held steady since the start of 2014. And while Chevron boasts of an annual streak of 29 years with increasing dividends, it held the dividend constant for 10 quarters during the oil downturn. The 29-year streak was kept alive because of the mid-year timing of its dividend increases. If you're only interested in yield, Shell is your best bet. But if you're interested in income and regular income growth, Exxon gets the nod. The next issue to look at is valuation. The price to tangible book value for all three of these oil giants is off the lows seen during the worst of the oil downturn. However, Shell's price to tangible book value has recovered materially over the past year and is roughly at the midpoint of where it's been for most of the past decade. It's no longer cheap relative to its own history. Chevron is getting back into a more normal range as well. XOM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts Exxon's price to tangible book value, meanwhile, remains close to the lowest levels it's seen over the past 10 years. To be fair, Exxon's price to tangible book value ratio is above those of Chevron and Shell. But it has historically been higher, largely because investors consider it to be the best-run oil company. That Exxon appears cheap compared with its own history is what's noteworthy here. One again, Exxon comes out on top. Exxon, Chevron, and Shell are all well-run companies, and any one of them could be a fine addition to your portfolio. But if you're a long-term investor, Exxon looks like the best overall option today when you consider historical valuations, financial strength, management's ability to put investor cash to work, and dividends. That said, if all you care about is yield, then Shell is your best bet -- but go in knowing that you may not be getting the best value. ","

Fishing in uncharted waters Fishing among the unknown names in small-cap land certainly helps Balkin get those returns. It’s an old investing trick to look for “hidden gems.” Especially since the sell-side-analyst army got trimmed after the crackdown on Wall Street following the tech meltdown, many of the companies aren’t well-covered, if at all. So it’s easier to find hot products and trends the rest of the market hasn’t learned about. “We try to identify names that are below the radar screen,” says Balkin. “That is the art of what we do.” In contrast, big companies like Exxon Mobil

                                   have too many analysts to leave much hope that you might find something they missed. Hitting the road Next, at a time when so many investors never leave the office because they’re hunched over computers and sorting through “big data” to pick names, it’s refreshing that Balkin and his team regularly beat these “quants” by hitting the road. “We need to sit across the table from the management teams to understand how they think about their businesses and see the business in operation,” says Balkin. Meeting executives can reveal nuances about company cultures and even red flags, says co-manager Ward Sexton. “Do they have a big, shiny building with their name on it?” he says. Being housed in Taj Mahal-style headquarters can signal management hubris. Another potential sign is the corporate jet — normally not a necessity for a small company unless they have remote locations. The William Blair Small Cap Growth Fund’s managers also check to see that executive pay is aligned with shareholders. Beyond that, the fund managers look for companies growing faster than their peers, with stocks trading at reasonable valuations due to the market inefficiencies in small-cap land. Here are three examples. Yelp Granted, this publisher of crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses is hardly unknown to investors. But by Balkin’s estimates, they’re all missing something because it still looks relatively cheap. Yelp

Yelp should see continued growth as more local advertising moves online, following the trend in national advertising. Balkin also sees potential in Yelp’s “request a quote” service, which lets people use the site to ask contractors for quotes on jobs, for example. “This increases the perceived value of Yelp to the businesses and to the Yelp user,” says Balkin. Codexis This is more typical of the kind of undiscovered growth company that Balkin and his team like to hunt for.

189,,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - During her thirties, Kate was groped twice by a colleague, another pressed his leg against her during a meeting and a boss turned hostile after she rebuffed his advances. On some mornings, she vomited before going to work because she was so anxious about seeing a manager who made endless sexual innuendos - which eventually drove her to quit. “That guy was motivated by real contempt for women,” said Kate, 43, by phone, declining to give her surname. Kate said she did not dare speak out until her last day at the Boston firm, when she complained to human resources. Such reluctance to report sexual harassment is common, experts said, as people often fear they will not be taken seriously, be branded a complainer, get colleagues fired or lose their own jobs. While allegations of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s predatory sexual behavior have moved millions of women to share their stories of abuse on social media with the hashtag #MeToo, experts doubt there will be much change in the workplace. “In the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal, we have not been informed about any new commitments ... companies are taking to fight against sexual harassment,” said Deborah Gillis, head of Catalyst, a non-profit advocating for women in business. Only one of the 20 top Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies responded to queries from the Thomson Reuters Foundation as to whether the recent scandals had prompted them to revisit their sexual harassment policies. “Harassment, even in its most subtle forms, directly conflicts with company policy,” a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil said in emailed comments, adding that the oil producer had a zero tolerance policy toward harassment. The remainder declined to comment or did not respond. Yet sexual harassment in the workplace is ubiquitous, experts say. Between 25 to 85 percent of women reported being sexually harassed at work, a 2016 report by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found. But the federal agency, which is responsible for handling such allegations, received less than 10,000 complaints a year between 2011 and 2016. The EEOC found that employees routinely fail to report harassment because they anticipate negative reactions, such as being blamed for undermining morale or subjected to retaliation that could damage their career or personal reputation. U.S. companies’ reaction to the raging public debate about harassment has been muted. Experts said it was unlikely that corporations would take significant actions that could end a culture of silence over workplace abuse. “These scandals, if anything, are going to get organizations to dust off their copies of their (harassment) policies,” Margaret Stockdale, a professor of psychology at the Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI), said by phone. Some firms would also likely retrain employees and issue notices that sexual harassment is not tolerated, she added. Managers at Amazon and the global advertising firm Interpublic Group of Companies sent zero tolerance memos to their staff last month, according to media reports. Fidelity Investments chairman, Abigail Johnson, also sent a video message to staff about the Boston-based company’s “no tolerance” policy, after two managers accused of sexual harassment were fired. But such policies risk backfiring, said Meg Bond, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “If immediately the axe will always fall, it sounds tough. But what (research) found is that it sometimes discourages people from raising those issues,” she said. “You’re not ready to raise it in a way that is going to get somebody fired,” she said in a phone interview. Zoe Chance, an assistant professor of marketing at Yale University who has written on sexual harassment, said new approaches are necessary - but it is not clear what works. “Doing more of what companies are already doing, I don’t think will yield positive results,” she said. Up-and-coming initiatives include training bystanders to speak up when witnessing harassment, and to assess employees’ ability to treat colleagues with respect as part of their performances reviews, Bond said. Stockdale of IUPUI said programs which track acts of retaliation by those accused of harassment also appear promising in encouraging victims to speak out. Back in Boston, Kate, who told her story as part of the #MeToo movement, has modest expectations. She first went public on Twitter a year ago, when the nation was abuzz over a video showing Donald Trump brag about grabbing women by the genitals as he was running for the presidency. “I hope this isn’t a blip,” she said. “We had this identical conversation last year.” (This version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph 8) ","

According to the online brokerage, its Investor Movement Index (IMX) increased to 7.4 in October after coming in at 7.14 for September. The index gauges what its customers are buying and selling via their TD Ameritrade accounts and their exposure to the stock market. TD Ameritrade said that, while customers were net buyers for nine months in a row, it was from September to October that the broker saw the IMX jump close to 4% to reach the second highest reading in the history of the index. The online trading firm said that October was characterized by strong U.S. markets, positive quarterly earnings on behalf of all sorts of companies and a global economy that is strengthening. Taken together, that appeared to influence retail investors' behavior on the positive side. ""TD Ameritrade clients have continued to be net buyers and seem to be putting their money where they see opportunity,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, in a press release this week announcing the monthly reading of the IMX.

193,Mike Murphy,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 6, 2017 2:42 a.m. ET Investigation raises questions about Wilbur Ross, other top members of Trump administration By A massive new leak of financial data has revealed how the world’s ultra-rich move trillions of dollars through offshore tax havens, and has raised new questions about the finances of top members of the Trump administration. The leak, known as the Paradise Papers, comes more than a year after the Panama Papers, for which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing offshore banking practices of the world’s elite. 1. So what is it? The Paradise Papers contains 13.4 million leaked documents, mostly from the Bermuda-based law firm Appleby and Singapore-based Asiaciti Trust. According to Appleby’s website, it specializes in providing offshore legal services for “global public and private companies, financial institutions, and high net-worth individuals.” Asiaciti Trust says it is “an international trust and corporate services provider.” As with the Panama Papers, the leaked data was shared with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which brought it to the ICIJ, which in turn led the collaborative investigation that involved nearly 100 media partners worldwide, including the New York Times, the Guardian, the BBC and NBC News. Read:  5 things to know about the Panama Papers And again, as with the Panama Papers, much of what the Paradise Papers reveals is perfectly legal.

Most of the information involved the ways politicians, celebrities and the mega-rich protect their cash from taxes, hide ownership of major assets and conduct business in secret. Most of the practices that were exposed are legal, though in many cases may be unethical. 3. Who was exposed? According to the Paradise Papers, Wilbur Ross, the U.S commerce secretary, was found to have business ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law and a Russian oligarch under U.S. sanctions, which he failed to disclose during his confirmation hearing earlier this year.

One of Navigator’s top clients was revealed to be Sibur, a Russian energy giant whose owners include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian billionaire and Putin ally who is the subject of sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department. Other top Sibur shareholders include Leonid Mikhelson, another Putin ally whose gas company, Novatek, is the target of U.S. sanctions, and Kirill Shamalov, Putin’s son-in-law. Ross’s stake in Navigator is reportedly held through a number of companies in the Cayman Islands. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, told NBC News that members of Congress who approved Ross’s nomination were unaware of the ties. “I am astonished and appalled because I feel misled,” Blumenthal told NBC News. “Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies.” 4.

See:  Kremlin-backed money behind Facebook, Twitter investments Milner, a Russian venture capitalist who bought a Silicon Valley home for $100 million in 2011, bought large stakes in both Facebook and Twitter. The Paradise Papers found that hundreds of millions of dollars for those investments came from VTB, a state-controlled Russian bank, and Gazprom Investholding, another state-controlled Russian financial institution. Those ties are of particular concern after revelations about Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through misinformation spread on both Facebook and Twitter. Milner told the Guardian that his investments did not buy influence at Twitter, and he told both the Guardian and the New York Times that the investments were not politically motivated. “Nothing more than business,” he said, according to the Times. Milner’s companies later sold those holdings. Milner is also a major investor in a real-estate investment company, Cadre, partly owned by Kushner. Kushner did not initially disclose his stake in Cadre when he joined the Trump administration. 6. Is that all? Not by a long shot.

194,,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - During her thirties, Kate was groped twice by a colleague, another pressed his leg against her during a meeting and a boss turned hostile after she rebuffed his advances. On some mornings, she vomited before going to work because she was so anxious about seeing a manager who made endless sexual innuendos - which eventually drove her to quit. “That guy was motivated by real contempt for women,” said Kate, 43, by phone, declining to give her surname. Kate said she did not dare speak out until her last day at the Boston firm, when she complained to human resources. Such reluctance to report sexual harassment is common, experts said, as people often fear they will not be taken seriously, be branded a complainer, get colleagues fired or lose their own jobs. While allegations of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s predatory sexual behavior have moved millions of women to share their stories of abuse on social media with the hashtag #MeToo, experts doubt there will be much change in the workplace. “In the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal, we have not been informed about any new commitments ... companies are taking to fight against sexual harassment,” said Deborah Gillis, head of Catalyst, a non-profit advocating for women in business. Only one of the 20 top Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies responded to queries from the Thomson Reuters Foundation as to whether the recent scandals had prompted them to revisit their sexual harassment policies. “Harassment, even in its most subtle forms, directly conflicts with company policy,” a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil said in emailed comments, adding that the oil producer had a zero tolerance policy toward harassment. The remainder declined to comment or did not respond. Yet sexual harassment in the workplace is ubiquitous, experts say. Between 25 to 85 percent of women reported being sexually harassed at work, a 2016 report by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found. But the federal agency, which is responsible for handling such allegations, received less than 10,000 complaints a year between 2011 and 2016. The EEOC found that employees routinely fail to report harassment because they anticipate negative reactions, such as being blamed for undermining morale or subjected to retaliation that could damage their career or personal reputation. U.S. companies’ reaction to the raging public debate about harassment has been muted. Experts said it was unlikely that corporations would take significant actions that could end a culture of silence over workplace abuse. “These scandals, if anything, are going to get organizations to dust off their copies of their (harassment) policies,” Margaret Stockdale, a professor of psychology at the Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI), said by phone. Some firms would also likely retrain employees and issue notices that sexual harassment is not tolerated, she added. Managers at Amazon and the global advertising firm Interpublic Group of Companies sent zero tolerance memos to their staff last month, according to media reports. Fidelity Investments chairman, Abigail Johnson, also sent a video message to staff about the Boston-based company’s “no tolerance” policy, after two managers accused of sexual harassment were fired. But such policies risk backfiring, said Meg Bond, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “If immediately the axe will always fall, it sounds tough. But what (research) found is that it sometimes discourages people from raising those issues,” she said. “You’re not ready to raise it in a way that is going to get somebody fired,” she said in a phone interview. Zoe Chance, an assistant professor of marketing at Yale University who has written on sexual harassment, said new approaches are necessary - but it is not clear what works. “Doing more of what companies are already doing, I don’t think will yield positive results,” she said. Up-and-coming initiatives include training bystanders to speak up when witnessing harassment, and to assess employees’ ability to treat colleagues with respect as part of their performances reviews, Bond said. Stockdale of IUPUI said programs which track acts of retaliation by those accused of harassment also appear promising in encouraging victims to speak out. Back in Boston, Kate, who told her story as part of the #MeToo movement, has modest expectations. She first went public on Twitter a year ago, when the nation was abuzz over a video showing Donald Trump brag about grabbing women by the genitals as he was running for the presidency. “I hope this isn’t a blip,” she said. “We had this identical conversation last year.” (This version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph 8) ","

According to the online brokerage, its Investor Movement Index (IMX) increased to 7.4 in October after coming in at 7.14 for September. The index gauges what its customers are buying and selling via their TD Ameritrade accounts and their exposure to the stock market. TD Ameritrade said that, while customers were net buyers for nine months in a row, it was from September to October that the broker saw the IMX jump close to 4% to reach the second highest reading in the history of the index. The online trading firm said that October was characterized by strong U.S. markets, positive quarterly earnings on behalf of all sorts of companies and a global economy that is strengthening. Taken together, that appeared to influence retail investors' behavior on the positive side. ""TD Ameritrade clients have continued to be net buyers and seem to be putting their money where they see opportunity,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, in a press release this week announcing the monthly reading of the IMX.

198,Mike Murphy,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 6, 2017 2:42 a.m. ET Investigation raises questions about Wilbur Ross, other top members of Trump administration By A massive new leak of financial data has revealed how the world’s ultra-rich move trillions of dollars through offshore tax havens, and has raised new questions about the finances of top members of the Trump administration. The leak, known as the Paradise Papers, comes more than a year after the Panama Papers, for which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing offshore banking practices of the world’s elite. 1. So what is it? The Paradise Papers contains 13.4 million leaked documents, mostly from the Bermuda-based law firm Appleby and Singapore-based Asiaciti Trust. According to Appleby’s website, it specializes in providing offshore legal services for “global public and private companies, financial institutions, and high net-worth individuals.” Asiaciti Trust says it is “an international trust and corporate services provider.” As with the Panama Papers, the leaked data was shared with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which brought it to the ICIJ, which in turn led the collaborative investigation that involved nearly 100 media partners worldwide, including the New York Times, the Guardian, the BBC and NBC News.

Most of the information involved the ways politicians, celebrities and the mega-rich protect their cash from taxes, hide ownership of major assets and conduct business in secret. Most of the practices that were exposed are legal, though in many cases may be unethical. 3. Who was exposed?

See:  Kremlin-backed money behind Facebook, Twitter investments Milner, a Russian venture capitalist who bought a Silicon Valley home for $100 million in 2011, bought large stakes in both Facebook and Twitter. The Paradise Papers found that hundreds of millions of dollars for those investments came from VTB, a state-controlled Russian bank, and Gazprom Investholding, another state-controlled Russian financial institution. Those ties are of particular concern after revelations about Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through misinformation spread on both Facebook and Twitter. Milner told the Guardian that his investments did not buy influence at Twitter, and he told both the Guardian and the New York Times that the investments were not politically motivated. “Nothing more than business,” he said, according to the Times. Milner’s companies later sold those holdings. Milner is also a major investor in a real-estate investment company, Cadre, partly owned by Kushner. Kushner did not initially disclose his stake in Cadre when he joined the Trump administration. 6. Is that all? Not by a long shot.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

201,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

202, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

203,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

204,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

205,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

207,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

208, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

209,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up.

210,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

211,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

213,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says.

Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

214, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

215,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

216,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

217,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

219,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

220, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

221,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

222,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

223,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

225,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

226, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

227,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

228,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

229,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

231,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

232, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

234,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

235,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

237,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

238, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

239,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

240,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

241,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

243,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

244, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

245,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

246,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

247,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

249,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

250, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

251,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

252,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand.

Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

253,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

255,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions.

256, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

257,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

258,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

259,,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"The project, details of which have not been reported before, would allow Kuwait to diversify its gas imports in the wake a political crisis between Gulf states and major supplier Qatar. “Iraq needs to urgently reduce gas flaring as it trails behind all targets it has promised the World Bank,” said a senior industry source working on the project but not allowed to discuss it publicly. “The Kuwaiti gas project is a quick fix and an easy way to monetize gas resources.” The World Bank, which has repeatedly made reducing gas flaring a condition of lending to Baghdad, did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Toyo is proposing to construct a gas pipeline and start deliveries after 2019, industry sources said. Toyo’s chief financial officer, Kensuke Waki, told Reuters that talks about a pipeline and a petrochemical plant were ongoing but a final investment decision had not yet been made. Kuwait is very keen on the project and has offered a sovereign guarantee for up to 80 percent of the costs, industry sources said. No total cost has been announced. Kuwait’s oil ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq said last month that talks between Kuwait and Iraq were focused on a proposal to use gas to help pay Baghdad’s final $4.6 billion in war compensation payments. Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said talks were focusing on price and confirmed that supplies could be used to help pay off reparations. Industry sources told Reuters the talks have faltered over price, however. They said Kuwait is pushing for a price of less than $3 per mbtu (million British thermal unit), in line with U.S. Henry Hub prices. But that is less than half what Iraq pays in the north when importing gas from neighboring Iran. “The price of gas remains the key sticking point for now,” one of the sources said. He also said both Iraq and Kuwait were pushing to have the petrochemical plant built on their territory to further capitalize on gas deliveries. Iraq used to supply Kuwait with gas from Rumaila. Volumes reached as much as 400 mcf per day but stopped shortly after the 1990 invasion. More than a million claimants in Kuwait have been paid as part of Baghdad’s $52.4 billion reparations bill for the invasion. But Iraq, hurt by the 2014 fall in oil prices and its war with Islamic State militants, requested a delay on the last and largest tranche, which is due this year. Kuwait, although one of OPEC’s leading oil producers, has struggled to meet growing domestic gas demand. The shortfall has been estimated at 500 million cubic feet per day and is being covered mainly by LNG imports, including from Qatar. A decade ago Kuwait tried to build a pipeline from Qatar, but the move was blocked by Saudi Arabia. With relations between Riyadh and Doha worsening this year, Kuwait is looking to diversify its gas imports. Last year, Kuwait said it would be ready to buy up to 200 mcf/day of gas from Baghdad. Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Jihad said volumes could start at 50 mcf/d rising gradually to 200 mcf/d. Iraq’s gas reserves of 3.7 trillion cubic meters rank as 12th largest in the world but represent only a tenth of those of Iran, the world’s largest. It extracts large quantities of gas together with oil, however, and that gas is currently being flared. “Shell’s main aim was always to develop an LNG terminal and ultimately a petchem complex in Iraq,” said a Shell insider who worked on the gas project. With Iraq refusing to agree on a gas price with Shell, the project has hit a major impasse, industry sources said. Talks have also been complicated by Shell pulling out of the Majnoon oil fields earlier this year. “Iraq is furious at Shell and prospects don’t look that great for the Basra gas company,” one Iraqi industry source said. Asked about the negotiations, both Shell and the Iraqi oil ministry said discussions were ongoing and both sides remained committed to the project. ","

This sector includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling and refining, or integrated power utility companies including renewable energy and coal. ​The energy sector is a large and all encompassing term that describes a complex and inter-related network of companies directly and indirectly involved in the production and distribution of energy needed to power the economy and facilitate the means of production and transportation. Performance in the sector is largely driven by the supply and demand for worldwide energy. Oil and gas producers will do very well during times of high oil and gas prices, but will earn less when the value of the commodity drops. Oil refiners, on the other hand, benefit from the falling cost of feedstock to produce petroleum products like gasoline when crude oil prices drop. Furthermore, this sector is sensitive to political events, which historically have driven changes in the price of oil. Some of the largest companies in the U.S. energy sector include Exxon Mobil and Chevron, both of which are large international integrated oil companies. Duke Energy Corporation is one of America's largest electricity providers as measured by number of customers, and Peabody Energy is America's largest coal producer measured by tons of output. All these companies are part of what is commonly known as the energy sector. ​There are a number of energy-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) that afford retail investors exposure to the sector. Investors can vary which part of the value chain they want exposure to with any number of funds. For example, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) gives investors exposure to the upstream oil and gas exploration companies, while the VanEck Vectors Coal ETF (KOL) gives investors access to the coal industry. Investors wanting access to alternative energy can invest in the Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN). There are many different ways for investors to gain exposure to the energy sector, depending on their preferences and specific views about the growth and earnings prospects across the value chain. The energy sector is bigger and more diversified than just the oil and gas industry. Many investors feel renewable and alternative energy sources will be important in the future as the popularity of electric cars grows. Traditional hydrocarbon producers seem to be falling out of favor for the time being. ",Energy Sector | Investopedia,0.9958

265,"Tyler Crowe, Matthew DiLallo, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The oil and gas market has been a tough nut to crack over the past few years. After the incredible collapse in oil prices from 2014 to early 2016, the industry has been slowly creeping back at a pace that many investors have ignored. There's no doubt that today's oil prices in the $50- to $60-per-barrel range isn't anywhere near the $100 or more we saw a few years ago, but the companies producing the stuff have made incredible strides to become profitable at these much lower prices. As a result, there are some rather attractive-looking investments in the oil and gas industry today. So we asked three of our investing contributors to each highlight an oil investment they see as a great buy now. Here's why they picked Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), U.S. Silica Holdings (NYSE:SLCA), and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (Marathon Oil): During the oil market downturn, Marathon Oil put together a simple playbook so it could start winning again at lower oil prices. The first few plays consisted mostly of blocking and tackling, such as strengthening its balance sheet, relentlessly focusing on costs, and simplifying and concentrating its portfolio. The company felt that if it could do those things well, then it could profitably grow within cash flows at lower oil prices, which would enable it to score gains for investors. Marathon has completed most of its more defensive-focused moves by selling higher-cost assets and using that cash to shore up its finances as well as bulk up its shale position. As a result, it can now generate enough cash flow at $50 oil to grow production by a 10% to 12% compound annual growth rate through 2021. Further, it can achieve that double-digit growth while also paying its current dividend. That ability to deliver healthy production growth within cash flow at $50 oil puts Marathon in an elite group. It's one of the few oil companies that can still create value for investors even if oil prices slip a bit while retaining uncapped upside if they continue recovering. That combination of a lower risk profile and high reward potential makes it an exceptional oil stock to consider buying, since it could still run up a big score for investors even if crude doesn't recover any further. Tyler Crowe (U.S. Silica Holdings): The frack sand market has been extremely volatile over the past few years. Back in 2014, it looked as if the industry could do no wrong, and then it became one of the hardest hit industries as the price of oil crashed and drilling activity in North America came to a grinding halt. Over the past year, though, the industry has picked back up in a big way. Just about every major frack sand supplier is running at full capacity and is in the process of expanding operations with new mines. There does appear to be some skepticism from Wall Street that all these new mines are needed. All this additional capacity could lead to another oversupply that kills margin. While that is a valid opinion, it may help boost the argument for U.S. Silica in the coming years. U.S. Silica has the most ambitious growth plans of its frack sand peers. Between acquisitions and greenfield projects, the company has either completed or is constructing facilities to expand production by 9 million tons per year, or a 70% increase from its production capacity from a year ago. Adding that much capacity sounds risky, but management is de-risking some of these projects by signing up customers to long-term takeaway contracts that ensure a high level of demand. According to management, the company has already secured takeaway contracts for 1.2 million tons of its recently announced 2.6 million ton-per-year facility near Midland, Texas, that also includes cash pre-payments to help fund the mine. Moves like this suggest the company's growth plans aren't as risky as they sound. If we assume that last quarter's results can be replicated in the coming quarters -- it seems reasonable as it expands capacity and grows margin through its logistics business -- then perhaps today's price-to-earnings ratio of 42 might not reflect the value in U.S. Silica's shares. MRO data by YCharts Reuben Gregg Brewer (ExxonMobil Corporation): Exxon is one of the world's largest integrated oil majors. It has historically traded at a premium to its peers, which it continues to do today. Only BP plc's (NYSE:BP) price to tangible book value is anywhere near Exxon's. But the other oil majors have been closing the gap. This is an interesting dynamic. In fact, Exxon's price to tangible book value sits near a 10-year low. That suggests that, relative to its own history, Exxon is cheap. Most of its peers appear either fairly valued (trading around the midpoint of their historical range) or even expensive (BP's ratio has moved notably higher this year) on this metric after stock price advances that have, basically, left Exxon behind. Exxon is down around 8% so far this year, while Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-B) tops the advancers at a roughly 13% gain. However, Exxon continues to be a top performer when it comes to putting shareholder money to work, as measured by return on capital employed. Recovering oil prices have led to improvement at all of the majors on this metric, but only ENI (NYSE:E) has excelled to the point where its returns are notably higher than Exxon's. Exxon continues to perform well as a business. In short, Exxon looks cheap on a relative basis compared to its history despite an improving industry outlook that's lifted the market's view of its peers. If you're looking for a good value in big oil, Exxon may be the right choice for you. ","

266,,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company’s refining operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, the company said on Monday. The changes at the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. Woods has moved first to reshape the parts of the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon’s refining operations. Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the downstream business overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will “improve decision making and enhance performance in the market.” The parts of the business impacted were refining and marketing divisions, said spokesman Scott Silvestri. Company sources told Reuters Exxon’s chemical operation also has been restructured, but Silvestri denied this. It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Exxon’s Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs. The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the downstream business as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. The downstream restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon’s Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter. The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said. Exxon’s refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared with its oil and gas production. Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand. The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year’s results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries. This year, the company’s oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices. Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year. Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified. It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole. Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes. ","

267,,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK, November 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has affirmed the National Short-Term Rating on ESSO (Thailand) Public Company Limited's (Esso) bills of exchange revolving programme of up to THB12 billion at 'F1(tha)'. The maturity of each series of bills is no more than 270 days under the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Parent Support: Fitch believes Esso has strong financial support from its ultimate parent, Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil). This was evident from the increase in inter-company loans from the parent group during the period of high financial leverage in 2014, in addition to the THB54 billion in standby credit facilities and the THB12 billion revolving loan facility from the parent group. Since then, the proportion of inter-group financing has remained high at 60%-65% of total financing, although Esso's total debt and financial leverage have decreased substantially. This has helped Esso to reduce its exposure to external debt. Esso is also able to leverage its parent's worldwide procurement network for crude oil and refined products, and use ExxonMobil's technology and engineering services, human resources and R&D to improve its operational efficiency. Higher Rating Headroom: Esso's financial buffer against drops in refining margins has increased, as its debt has decreased significantly for the past two and a half years thanks to strong operating cash flows and low capex. Esso's debt fell to THB16.9 billion at end-September 2017, the lowest level in 10 years, from THB35.7 billion at end-2014. Its leverage, as measured by FFO adjusted net leverage, decreased to 1.6x in the 12 months to end-September 2017. Fitch expects Esso's debt to continue falling in 2017-2018 due to a lack of major capex. However, leverage is likely to increase moderately in 2017-2018, as Fitch expects Esso's operating cash flows to soften and oil prices to gradually recover. Moderate Capex: Esso does not plan a major expansion or large investments in the next two to three years. The company aims to improve its production efficiency and increase its use of challenged crudes to control costs and improve margins, as well as enhance its retail network. These are small projects with low capex requirements. Esso's capex has been moderate at THB900 million to THB1.4 billion a year for the past four years, and is likely to remain at these levels in the next two to three years. Nevertheless, Esso may need to make a large investment to improve its refinery to comply with potential changes in emission standards, following the Euro V emission standard, although the government's plan to revise the standards remains undecided. Integrated Refiners: The rating also reflects Esso's complex refinery capacity, its favourable access to raw materials and established brand name. The integration of paraxylene (PX) production widens Esso's output range, optimises its product lines, and helps to reduce the volatility of the company's refining margins, although excess regional PX capacity has weakened margins. Esso also has a strong position in fuel retailing as Thailand's third-largest fuel retailer by volume in 2016 with 542 retail stations. Highly Cyclical Business: Esso's credit profile is tempered by its high vulnerability to oil prices, refining margins and petrochemical product-to-feed margins, as well as high working-capital volatility, which can significantly affect its earnings and cash-flow generation. The company is also exposed to single-production-site risk. DERIVATION SUMMARY Esso's rating reflects the integration of its refinery, petrochemical production and oil retailing businesses. Esso's business profile is moderate relative to Thai downstream oil and gas peers with its leverage relatively higher than most of its peers. Esso's operating scale is smaller than that of IRPC Public Company Limited  , while its financial leverage similar. IRPC has larger refinery and petrochemical operations and generates more EBITDA from the petrochemical business, resulting in higher margins. However, we view Esso as having stronger linkages with its ultimate parent, ExxonMobil. Esso has much smaller operating scale than PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited and Thai Oil Public Company Limited and higher leverage than these two companies. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Crude oil prices (Brent) of USD52.5 per barrel in 2018, USD55 per barrel in 2019, and USD57.5 thereafter, with Esso's crude procurement costs adjusted for applicable premiums - High gross refining margin in 2017, and softer margin in  2018 and thereafter - PX product-to-feed margin to gradually increase in 2019-2021 - Maintenance capex and small efficiency improvement projects in 2017-2021 - Dividend payment in 2018 and thereafter RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A significant strengthening of its links with ExxonMobil group Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Weakening ownership and support from ExxonMobil group - Weaker access to bank loans and debt capital market - Sustained high financial leverage exceeding 6.5x (measured by FFO adjusted net leverage) LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Esso had outstanding debt of THB16.9 billion at end-September 2017. Most of the THB10.4 billion of debt due to mature within 12 months was short-term debt. This will be supported by cash and cash equivalents of THB776 million, estimated free cash flow of THB1.8 billion in 2018 and the available undrawn revolving loan facilities from the ExxonMobil group totalling THB66.0 billion at end-September 2017 as well as available uncommitted facilities of THB32.4 billion from financial institutions.

The index covers all major sectors of the market, and some of its top constituents (by index weight) include Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway B, Johnson & Johnson, ExxonMobil and J.P. Morgan Chase (current as of Oct. 23, 2017). Although the S&P 500 contains 500 constituents, it may contain greater than 500 “constituent trading lines” since some companies are represented by multiple share classes.  Created By: Created by Standard & Poor’s in 1957. Currently maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Number of Companies: 500 large-cap companies (market cap of $6.1 billion or greater) Types of Companies: The S&P 500 tries to cover all major areas of the U.S. economy. Selection Criteria: Components are chosen by the U.S. Index Committee and rebalanced quarterly. How it's Calculated: The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index.  Advantages: The S&P 500 is one of the best benchmarks in the world for large-cap stocks. By including 500 companies, it offers great diversification and accounts for approximately 80% of the U.S. market. The performance of the S&P 500 is considered one of the best overall indicators of market performance and many investors and fund managers attempt to outperform the index. Disadvantages: The index contains only large-cap U.S. companies. As such, may not be the best benchmark for investors who own small-cap stocks and/or foreign companies. Also, the top 50 companies by market capitalization account for about 50% of the index’s value – so they have a larger impact on the index calculation. Investing: There are several index funds that track the S&P 500, including the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), or “Spider” – the most actively traded ETF by trading volume. You can also trade the e-mini S&P futures contract (ticker symbol ES). (For more, see SPY: SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF.) ",Index Investing: The Standard & Poor's 500 Index,0.9949

There's nothing quite like a good, solid oil dividend, right? Anyone looking for a strong dividend payout backed by torrential cash flows must surely be impressed by ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield and 34 years of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Exxon is indeed a great income stock, but there are many dividend stocks out there that offer even better policies than the oil giant. You don't even have to stick within the energy market. A panel of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool has put together a handful of stocks with better yields than ExxonMobil. Read on to see how Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) can beat the big oil stocks from the perspective of a dividend hunter. You can do better than Exxon. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Spirit Realty Capital): Shares of this retail-focused REIT are too cheap to ignore. Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

It's been a tough time for value investors. Earlier this year, a research report from Goldman Sachs noted that value investing -- selling higher-valued stocks and buying undervalued ones -- no longer provided investors with the same overperformance as it once had. In fact, the strategy would have resulted in a cumulative loss of 15% over the prior decade, while the S&P 500 has nearly doubled. That's a significant shift: In 1997, Professors Eugene Fama, a Nobel prize winner widely considered the father of modern finance, along with Kenneth French, published a research study showing that during the 20-year period ended 1995, the difference between investing in low book-to-market multiples (value stocks) versus high multiples (growth stocks) was 7.6% per year. Image source: Getty Images Amazon's most valuable assets at its 2017 robotics challenge. Image source: Amazon.com. Both Einhorn and cable mogul John Malone have identified the culprit that's destroyed traditional value investing: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). After jokingly calling the company the ""Death Star,"" Malone noted that the richly valued company would disrupt every industry on the planet. Einhorn wrote, ""Our view is that just because Amazon can disrupt somebody else's profit stream, it doesn't mean that Amazon earns that profit stream. For the moment, the market doesn't agree."" Traditional value isn't dead, but rather the definition of value has changed. Fama and French used price-to-book as their dominant metric. Broadly, this favors more ""stuff"" on the books -- assets such as plants, machines, equipment, and buildings. A report from 13D research, by way of The Reformed Broker, noted that the five largest companies by market capitalization in 2007 were mostly in asset-heavy industries: PetroChina, ExxonMobil, General Electric, China Mobile, and Bank of China, and were worth a collective $2.3 trillion. Today, the top five companies are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon, which are now worth $3 trillion with fewer assets (excluding cash) and 44% fewer employees. The issue for value investors is it's hard to measure non-tangible assets and employee quality, but it's necessary. In 2013, Bloomberg noted that as little as 7% of the value of large corporations is from tangible assets, with intangibles such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights accounting for more than 90%. Unfortunately, generally accepted accounting rules do a poor job of accounting for intangible assets on both the balance sheet and the income statement. Employees are not a bookable asset, and using the price-to-earnings ratio is a poor metric to value companies with high intangible assets, because the internal costs of patent development are mostly expensed as occurred -- not capitalized, where they appear on the balance sheet -- while the economic benefits often occur later and over multiple periods. Value investors need to incorporate intangible assets into their analysis, because these trends are only accelerating. It isn't that value investing is dead -- it's just the definition of value has changed, and investors need to change along with it. ","

275,,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors. “We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change,” Justin Anderson, Exxon’s lawyer, said. But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company’s actions elsewhere. “They can only be held to account here for what they’ve done here,” Anderson said. Richard Johnston, Healey’s chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees’ marketing and  conducted advertising on their behalf. “We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements,” Johnston said. He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change. Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon’s own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman’s investigations. Tuesday’s hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge’s January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents. While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee. “They believe they’re buying Exxon gas,” Justice Elspeth Cypher said. “The citizens of this state believe that’s what they’re buying.” (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped word “of” in 3rd paragraph, removes extra “if” in seventh paragraph) ","

276,,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"Neil Chapman, the head of its global chemicals operations, was named to the company’s management committee, a board-elected panel that typically serves as a stepping stone for future chief executives, Exxon said on Friday. Chapman, 55, joins CEO Woods and four other senior vice presidents on the committee, which oversees the company’s global operations. The president of ExxonMobil Chemical Co also was promoted to corporate senior vice president. The merger of the world’s largest publicly-traded oil producer’s refining and marketing operations will take place in the first quarter, the company said. Bryan Milton, 53, president of Exxon’s fuels, lubricants & specialties marketing business, was named president of the new ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co effective Jan. 1. Dennis Wascom, president of Exxon’s refining and supply subsidiary, will become vice president of operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. Woods took over the top job in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. The merging of refining, lubricants and marketing is the first major move by Woods since replacing Tillerson and is in the company’s downstream operations, which he used to lead before taking over as CEO. The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and lubricant businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operation, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. The company’s downstream sector has grown in prominence since Woods took over leadership of Exxon. The changes come as Exxon expands its refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year’s results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. ","

277,Alan Farley,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Chevron Corporation (CVX) have underperformed throughout 2017 but could lift into market leadership in 2018, underpinned by a resilient crude oil market and strong U.S. economy, supercharged by tax cuts and deregulation. However, buying these stocks too early could be hazardous to your bottom line because end-of-year tax selling may inhibit buying power until the calendar flips in January. The WTI crude oil contract has lifted to a two-year high and could soon test resistance in the lower $60s. Meanwhile, OPEC and Russia have just agreed to extend oil output curbs through the end of 2018, allowing U.S. energy companies to benefit from higher commodity prices as well as ramped-up production levels because our government has not agreed to similar cuts. Taken together, energy stocks at all capitalization levels could finally enter bull market advances. (See also: A Guide to Investing in Oil Markets.) Exxon Mobil shares broke out above the 2008 high at $95.64 in December 2013 and hit an all-time high at $104.76 in July 2014. A steep downturn accelerated in the second quarter of 2015, finally coming to rest at a five-year low in the mid-$60s in August. The subsequent recovery posted two broad rally impulses, lifting the stock into the closely-aligned 786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement and failed breakout levels in July 2016. A shallow but persistent correction off that resistance level finally ended in the mid-$70s in August, giving way to a bounce that mounted the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in October. The stock has been crisscrossing the moving average for the past two months, trying to build support, while price action since February 2017 has carved a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern. This potent combination predicts that a breakout above the neckline at $84 will generate a test at long-term resistance in the mid-$90s. On-balance volume (OBV) bottomed out in August 2015 and lifted into a 52-week high in July 2016. A sideways chop into the second half of 2017 signaled a delicate balance between bulls and bears, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reached a two-year high in October. This renewed buying interest could mark a tradable low ahead of superior 2018 performance. Even so, it is likely that positions taken in the mid-$80s following an inverse head and shoulders breakout will require a relatively long-term holding period to build sizable profits. (For more, see: Exxon, Chevron and Oil Are Breaking Out.) Chevron stock has carved a stronger price pattern than its Dow rival, but significant technical challenges remain. It broke out above the 2008 high at $104.63 in 2011 and entered a rising wedge pattern that persisted into the July 2014 all-time high at $135.10. The subsequent downturn broke wedge support in October and failed the multi-year breakout in June 2015, triggering a decline that continued into August, when it bottomed out at a five-year low near $70. A healthy uptick through 2016 unfolded through three rally waves that stalled near $120 in December. Loyal shareholders suffered through a persistent decline in the first half of 2017, with strong support at $102 finally taking hold in July. The stock rallied back to the 2016 high in October and dropped into a narrow trading range that may now complete the handle in a cup and handle pattern. A breakout should bring the 2014 high into play, with that level marking the final barrier ahead of a bull market advance that could add many points in the coming years. Meanwhile, OBV has just lifted above the December 2016 recovery high and reached a three-year high, predicting that price will play catch-up in coming months. Even so, the stock has gained less than two points to far in 2017, increasing the odds that tax selling pressure will inhibit buying power into early 2018. (See also: The Top 3 Chevron Shareholders.) Big oil price action has improved greatly in the second half of 2017, lifting major players into price levels that could support healthy 2018 upside. Chevron looks like a better bet than Exxon Mobil in this bullish scenario, set to test this decade's bull market high after it mounts resistance at $119.

278,Fred Imbert,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"Mark Fisher, one of the most well-known traders on Wall Street, has put together an alternative index to the 120-year-old Dow Jones industrial average. Fisher, CEO of MBF Clearing, launched the ""Essential 40"" index earlier this year,  an index that includes Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Visa and UnitedHealth, among others. KKM Financial launched a mutual fund on Monday, the Essential 40 Stock Fund (ESSIX), which tracks the index. ""It's today's version of the Dow Jones,"" Fisher told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday. ""It's the 40 most essential names to the way you live."" ""Without these names your life is blank,"" he said jokingly. Below is a chart of the 40 stocks in the Essential 40 index and how they have performed in 2017: Throughout its history, the Dow has been the go-to benchmark of the U.S. stock market for Main Street market watchers. The biggest difference between the Dow and Fisher's Essential 40 index — aside from the number of stocks in them and how long they've been around — is how they are weighted. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with a higher price will have a bigger sway on the index's overall direction. Stocks in the Essential 40 index, meanwhile, all have a 2.5 percent weight on the index. Fisher is one of the most wildly followed commodities traders on Wall Street, being known for making calls on oil and energy. He has also worked with the likes of legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Oil prices are up about 7 percent in 2017, following a year where they shot up 45 percent. But at current levels, Fisher thinks crude is ""trapped."" ""I think the upside is limited to $60-$63 and the downside is capped around the high $40s,"" he said. ""I think that, if we go up much more, what will happen is you'll see a lot more rigs come online."" Fisher also said that a lot of people in OPEC and Russia are comfortable with crude trading at these levels. U.S. oil gained 0.37 percent to trade at $57.68 per barrel on Tuesday.

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) seems like it should be one of the best dividend stocks on the market. The company makes a commodity that isn't going to be replaced anytime soon and is one of the biggest names in energy today. But peek under the hood of ExxonMobil's business and the picture gets dark pretty quickly. Oil's future is in question, the company isn't investing in its own production, and the dividend payout ratio is already at a troubling level. Here's why investors should be concerned about ExxonMobil's dividend in the long term. Image source: Getty Images. It's tough to argue that the oil business is a long-term growth business long-term in 2017. The chart below shows that ExxonMobil's revenue and net income are both in decline over the past five years -- largely because of falling oil prices -- and the future doesn't look much better. XOM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Electric vehicles (EVs) are beginning to be viable for millions of auto consumers and automakers are planning a massive expansion in their EV fleets. According to the International Energy Agency, 2 million electric vehicles were on the road at the end of 2016. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) optimistic view of EVs has over 20 million EVs on the road in 2020 and over 200 million in 2030. Even the bearish view estimates that nearly 60 million EVs will be on the road in 2030. No matter how you look at it, EVs will be a sizable chunk of the vehicles on the road, which stands at 1.3 billion vehicles today. Each vehicle built with batteries rather than an internal combustion engine is a vehicle that's replacing a source of oil and gasoline demand. Since oil is priced at the margin (meaning the last barrel produced is really what determines price), that'll put pressure on oil prices, revenue, and earnings at ExxonMobil. Another flaw in ExxonMobil right now is that the company has been investing less in its own assets for years now. You can see below that capital expenditures are less than half of what they were five years ago, and without the reduction in spending, free cash flow would be underwater. XOM Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts. The oil and natural gas business are all about replacing production with new reserves, which requires investment in capital expenses. And ExxonMobil isn't doing that right now. Between the end of 2015 and the end of 2016 proved reserves dropped 19.3% to 19.97 billion barrels, driven by falling oil prices and the drop in investment. Eventually, the well will run dry and ExxonMobil will shrink simply because it isn't investing in projects that will generate returns in the future. I've mentioned some flaws in ExxonMobil's business, but the chart below shows that its dividend is already on thin ice. Companies want to be generating more free cash flow than they pay out in dividends, and over the last three years, ExxonMobil hasn't done that. The result is using debt to fund the dividend, which increases long-term risk for investors. XOM Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Borrowing to keep the dividend afloat may be a reasonable idea if the future looked bright for ExxonMobil, but it doesn't. Fossil fuels are being disrupted by renewable energy and EVs and that makes this a tough dividend to bet on today. I'm so confident that ExxonMobil will underperform the market that I'm giving it an underperform call on My CAPS page. ","

With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.9993
281,Jason Hall,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Surprisingly enough, a huge portion of that value is derived from a very small group of companies. Of the thousands of publicly traded companies operating today, the 30 largest ones are worth almost $10 trillion -- about one-third of the entire market's value. Here is a closer look at each of the 30 biggest companies on the stock market. (Note: All market data as of Nov. 30, 2017.) Apple's iPhone X is just the latest tech marvel from the world's most valuable -- and profitable -- company. Image source: Apple. With a market capitalization of $868.8 billion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made for one of the greatest investing stories in history. And not once, but twice. Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, the early success of its Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh computers made it a huge financial success for anyone who invested in the company after its 1980 IPO. But a number of challenges and a power struggle led to the departure of Jobs in 1985. After years of steady loss of market share to another company on this list, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple brought Jobs back in 1997, when the company was on the brink of failure. Following his return, Apple went on to develop the iMac, iPod (and subsequently iTunes), and the product that has made it the most valuable public company on Earth: the iPhone in 2007. The company is on track to ship 30 million of its new iPhone X smartphones in the current quarter. Given their price of $999 to $1,149 each, the company should command more than $30 billion in sales this quarter from this single product. Image source: Google. The parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is worth $720.8 billion. But unlike Apple, which makes a living selling high-end tech devices, Alphabet doesn't charge its users much or anything at all for most of its services. YouTube, Google search, Gmail, Google Drive cloud storage, and Documents productivity software are all free at their basic levels, while some premium services -- like additional storage and ad-free content on YouTube -- are available for a modest fee. And Alphabet uses those massive profits to invest in even more innovation. The company is a leader in self-driving vehicle technology, clean energy, and connecting more of the world to the internet. Image source: Microsoft. Like Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) played a big role in the advent of affordable personal computing. But while Apple developed a fully integrated software and hardware system, Microsoft is all about software. It also was a big reason why Apple lost the home PC wars in the late 1980s, while Microsoft, with its ""Wintel"" duopoly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) (which is also on this list) went on to command virtually the entire personal computer market for decades. However, Microsoft has all but missed out on the smartphone revolution, with its Windows Phone never really garnering much commercial success. However, this lack of success with handheld devices hasn't kept Big Softy from being wildly profitable and still a growth company. After all, the company's operating systems and other software are still critically important to running the infrastructure that powers much of the world's computing power. Microsoft has become a major player in cloud computing, a huge growth market. The company increased its market share last year, growing segment revenue 14% to $7 billion last quarter alone. Microsoft may have lost out to Apple in mobile computing, but it's not going to miss out on the cloud. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of few companies to emerge from the late 1990s tech bubble a success. And with a market cap of $560 billion, it easily qualifies as the biggest. Started by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore, Amazon sells just about everything today, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Prime membership program for free shipping, free TV, and free movie streaming. Prime members count on Amazon as their first -- and often only -- stop for online shopping. The company's sales are growing strongly: Last quarter alone, revenue was up 34% to $44 billion. E-commerce isn't the only nascent industry Amazon is dominating, either. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the company's cloud computing provider, and Amazon commands substantial market share in this space as one of the lowest-cost providers. Last quarter, AWS generated almost $1.2 billion in operating income for Amazon, and it's set for potentially years of growth to come. Image source: Getty Images. The dominant social media platform, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), is worth $508.9 billion. Founded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several other Harvard students in 2004, it was initially available only to fellow Harvard classmates and then a few other colleges. More than 26% of humanity regularly uses Facebook. That's a stunning figure, but it also means about three-fourths of us don't. Facebook's management would tell you that's room for growth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Led by legendary investor and CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is worth $468.4 billion. Since Buffett took over the company 50 years ago -- it was a struggling textile manufacturer at the time -- and converted it into a holding company for his various other investments, Berkshire has created enormous wealth for tens of thousands of shareholders. Today, Berkshire is a sprawling conglomerate, with subsidiaries engaged in insurance, railways, candy making, manufacturing, electricity production, and too many other businesses to name here. Much of Berkshire's value also owes to its stock portfolio, which includes a number of the other companies on this list. At last count, Berkshire's stock holdings were worth about $180 billion, an amount that's likely to grow for years to come. Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma. Image source: Alibabagroup.com. Alibaba Group has rocketed up the top 30 list on expectations that its growth is just getting started. This year, the stock price has climbed 90%, even after a recent 9% drop. With China's middle class on track to crack 500 million people within a few years, Alibaba's best days could well be ahead. Image source: Johnson & Johnson. More than 130 years after its founding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is still one of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry, as reflected by its $375 million market value. Best-known for consumer brands including Band-Aid and Tylenol, the healthcare giant is also a major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Last quarter, its pharmaceutical segment generated almost half of sales, while medical devices were worth twice as much revenue as the consumer-goods segment. Looking ahead, JNJ's management is banking on the need for more healthcare spending as a significant portion of the world's population gets older. Life expectancies are increasing, but it will require significant medical support to care for a growing aging population. Even after 130 years of success, the company's future still looks bright. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has its roots as far back as 1799, with the founding of one of its predecessors, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. After dozens of acquisitions and mergers in the many years since, today's JPMorgan Chase is America's biggest bank, and one of the world's largest by total assets. It's worth $360 million at recent share prices. Since the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, has built up a fortress-like balance sheet and developed some of the most conservative lending practices in the industry. So, even as one of the biggest banks out there, it is also considered one of the safest for investors to own. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $348.6 billion, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is similar to JPMorgan Chase in that it's a product of numerous acquisitions and mergers over the years. It also has its roots in the early days of the American oil industry, directly descended from multiple companies that were part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A true integrated ""supermajor,"" ExxonMobil participates in every aspect of the oil and gas value chain, including exploration and production, distribution, refining and chemical manufacturing, and selling refined products. Last quarter, this generated $66 billion in sales and $4 billion in profits -- better than recent quarters thanks to higher oil prices. But at the same time, there are growing concerns that the advent of cheaper renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles will start making fossil fuels irrelevant sooner than many expect. Image source: Bank of America. With a market cap of $295.7 billion, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is second to JPMorgan Chase among the most valuable U.S. banks. It's also the nation's second-biggest bank by assets as well. Unlike many of its megabank peers, Bank of America's roots aren't in New York: The company started with the founding of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to serve the large immigrant community in the city, which faced discrimination by other banks at the time. By the late 1920s, Bank of Italy was renamed Bank of America and Italy, and it would merge with another California-based bank named -- you guessed it -- Bank of America. Now headquartered in North Carolina, B of A was one of the banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, with two major acquisitions -- Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- leading to billions of dollars in losses, as well as tens of billions in fines and penalties related to Countrywide's mortgage practices. But today, Bank of America has emerged strong and profitable under the solid leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Wal-Mart stores. Even as e-commerce becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, brick-and-mortar behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a retail giant, with a market cap of $289.8 billion. Founded by Sam Walton in the early 1960s, Wal-Mart now operates more than 11,600 stores, it sold $486 billion in merchandise last year, and it employs 2.3 million people around the world. And don't count the discount retailer out of the retail future, either. The company has aggressively invested in growing its e-commerce business, and it's paying off. Last quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 50%, helping drive total sales up 4.2%. The ""death of retail"" may be grossly exaggerated, at least when it comes to Wal-Mart. Image source: Wells Fargo. The third bank to make the first half of our top 30, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) makes the list at $279.3 billion. Founded in 1852 in San Francisco early during the gold rush, it not only offered banking services, but also express service to deliver gold and other valuables quickly. And while the modern Wells Fargo is the product -- like almost every big bank -- of numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, its success has generally been a product of conservative management and lending practices that have kept it out of trouble during the numerous banking crises over the past 150-plus years. But that story may be changing. More recently, Wells' results have trailed its peers' as the effects of the fake accounts scandal play out. Last quarter, Wells was the only big bank to report a decline in its revenue, and it also saw earnings per share fall more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. In short, there's evidence that customers are avoiding Wells, and choosing instead to bank with its competitors. Over time, it's likely that this will change as long as the company can get its act together. But in the meantime, its tarnished reputation is hurting its bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $271.9 billion, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B) is the second-most valuable public energy company on the U.S. market, behind only ExxonMobil. Also like ExxonMobil, Shell is an integrated supermajor, engaging in the full range of oil and gas industry businesses. But Shell is a bit different from ExxonMobil in its strategy. Following its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, management launched a strategic shift toward natural gas, where it sees greater long-term demand growth versus oil. The company has also made reducing debt -- which ballooned to over $95 billion at the peak -- and expenses a priority, as well as taking steps to increase the return on its investments. Shell has only just begun chipping away at its debt, but over the past year, profits and cash flows have surged on improved operating results, as well as higher oil prices. Shell is still exposed to many of the same risks as ExxonMobil when it comes to disruption from renewables, but that's one of the reasons management has prioritized natural gas, which produces fewer emissions and serves more industrial uses than oil. Image source: Visa. It may surprise you to know that electronic payments network giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), with a market cap of $249.8 billion, has only been a public company for about 10 years. Started in 1958 as part of Bank of America and called BankAmericard, it would not become a separate company until 1970, and even then, it was largely under the control of the many banks that issued BankAmericards. In 1968, it would formally change its name -- and the name of the cards issued on its network -- to Visa, but it would remain privately held until finally going public in March 2008. Visa's IPO, which was for half of the company's shares, raised $19.1 billion, making it the biggest-ever IPO at the time. Even with its massive size, Visa still has strong growth prospects. Electronic payments are only a small fraction of global transactions, but that's quickly changing as mobile computing and the global middle class converge. As a trusted name that merchants, financial institutions, and customers all count on, Visa is positioned for many more years of growth. Image source: Procter & Gamble. With a market cap of $226.8 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the most valuable makers of branded consumer products in the world. There's a  good chance you have at least one P&G product in your home right now -- and more likely several. The company's most recognizable brands include Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Vicks, but that's just a handful of the more than 60 brands the company makes and sells in over 180 countries. Founded in 1837, the company has spent the past 180 years developing and acquiring products that people use in their daily lives, many of which were major innovations at the time. More recently, the company has struggled to grow, having already expanded into just about every global market, and also facing stiff competition in many of its core segments. This has led management to streamline its brands and focus more intently on its most important businesses. Since 2013, the company has reduced its brand portfolio by more than half. Sales have fallen almost $15 billion since then, but earnings have improved since bottoming out in 2015. This is helping the company continue its track record of dividend growth. P&G has increased its dividend annually for 61 straight years. Image source: Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest and most valuable telecommunications company on the U.S. market, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is worth $224 billion. When Alexander Graham Bell founded AT&T in 1885, he probably didn't have any idea how much his company would transform over the next 130 years, while also staying remarkably the same. AT&T is still the largest provider of fixed-line telephone access in the U.S., but it's also the second-largest cellphone cellphone service provider, and the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., through its U-Verse cable and DirecTV satellite subsidiaries. The company is looking to get even bigger, with a pending acquisition for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in the works. However, the U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to sue over the proposed acquisition, creating some uncertainty (and a lot of drama thanks to the political implications). Image source: Getty Images. The third integrated super-major on this list, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is worth $222.6 billion. The company's roots go all the way back to 1879, with the founding of Pacific Coast Oil Co. in San Francisco and developing some of the state's earliest oil discoveries in Southern California. Coast oil would be acquired by Standard Oil in 1900 and consolidate its operations and take the Standard name in 1906. In 1911, it once again became a separate company when the federal government's antitrust suit led to the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil behemoth. Following decades of growth and expansion both in the U.S. and abroad, the company finally changed its name to Chevron in 1977 as part of its move to merge six domestic operations into one. Today, Chevron is solidly profitable, but its earnings and cash flows are still far below its historical levels, as it just isn't getting the same kinds of returns on its investments at recent oil prices. However, its results have improved over the past year as oil prices have risen. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $216 billion, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is the second-most valuable healthcare company and the most valuable health insurer and managed care provider in the United States. Founded in 1974 as Charter Med Incorporated, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created in 1977 as the parent company and taken public in 1984. In the 40 years since its founding, the Minnesota-based healthcare giant has steadily grown by expanding into new markets and acquiring companies in markets it wanted to enter. It also expanded its services to include prescription management and mail-order services, among others. At last count, the company insures 49 million people, and it generated more than $50 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in operating income in its most recent quarter. Image source: Pfizer. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is the third-most valuable healthcare company on this list, with a $215.8 billion market cap. Founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849, Pfizer found early success as a so-called ""fine chemicals"" maker for most of the first century of its existence. In the early 1950s, Pfizer scientists would discover and develop the antibiotic Terramycin, one of the first steps that began shifting its focus to research and development of pharmaceuticals. Over the past couple of decades, Pfizer has largely grown via acquisition of competitors including Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Wyeth in 2009, both of which have produced mixed results. Going forward, management continues to consider acquisitions to help augment its in-house R&D pipeline for new medicines. Image source: Roche. The third healthcare company in a row on this list, Switzerland-based Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), is worth $214.5 billion. Founded in 1986 by young entrepreneur Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, Roche's roots are in the industrial manufacture of medicines. Fast-forward 130 years, and Roche is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the pharmaceutical industry, with a major pipeline of potential cancer treatments, including immunotherapies. Roche is also one of the biggest R&D spenders in the healthcare space, having spent nearly $9 billion to develop new medicines and treatments last year alone. Image source: Getty Images. With nearly 875 million subscribers on its network, China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:CHL) is easily one of the world's biggest wireless providers, and it's worth $208.9 billion. One would expect it to carry a higher value, perhaps, due to its size and potential for growth. However, China Mobile -- and its biggest competitors -- are pretty much controlled by the Chinese government, which heavily regulates the wireless market in the country. Even with that reality, China Mobile is likely to grow in value as China's middle class continues to expand and mobile use becomes more prevalent. Mobile data consumption is also likely to increase across both consumer and business customers in the coming years, and that could be a catalyst for further growth for the Chinese wireless giant. Image source: Getty Images. Founded in 1979 with the opening of two stores in metro Atlanta, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is worth $207 billion, only trailing Wal-Mart for U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers in market value. It's also very different from Wal-Mart and other general merchandise retailers, with many of the products it sells being highly resistant to infringement from e-commerce. This includes products like lumber, which carpenters and builders often prefer to hand select, as well as items customers want to choose in person, such as tile, flooring, paint, cabinets, fixtures, and other big-ticket items you have to live with every day. It's certainly played out that way. While many other big-box retailers struggle just to keep the doors open, Home Depot's sales have increased 6% so far this year, and earnings are on track to grow 14%. Image source: Intel. The other half of the ""Wintel"" duopoly with Microsoft that dominated personal computing for more than two decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968 and is worth $205.7 billion today, making it the the most valuable stand-alone semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Also like Microsoft, Intel has had middling success in mobile computing while remaining incredibly strong in the data centers that drive cloud computing and corporate infrastructures. However, there's some concern that the company's fortress-like competitive position in the data center could be weakening. If that proves to be true, and competitors start taking market share, that would seriously crimp Intel's future prospects. But with a half-century of successful innovation in microprocessors, and one of the biggest R&D budgets in the space, I wouldn't count Intel out just yet. Image source: Getty Images. Like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in the manufacture of microprocessors, and it has a similar market value of $204.4 billion. However, it's also a very different company, since Intel designs and develops nearly all of the processors it makes, while Taiwan Semiconductor primarily contracts with so-called ""fabless"" semiconductor designers -- companies like Apple -- to manufacture chips for them. The upside is the company doesn't have to spend nearly as much on R&D -- it spent $11 billion less than Intel over the past year -- and instead focuses on high-quality, low-cost manufacturing while its customers invest in chip design. The downside? Maintaining a competitive advantage to keep those fabless chip designers coming to you for chip fabrication. It's certainly worked well for Taiwan Semiconductor, which has seen its earnings and market value grow more than 250% over the past decade, better than Intel over the same period. Image source: Verizon. With a market cap of $203.6 billion, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the second-biggest telecommunications company in the U.S. behind AT&T. Verizon leads the U.S. wireless market with 149 million customers, and it also has one of the biggest land-line operators. The company has also increased the size of its wireline internet business in recent years and says it now has 5.8 million customers using its Fios fiber-optic internet service. But where Verizon trails AT&T is in pay-TV subscribers, a gap that's likely to grow even wider when AT&T completes its acquisition of Time Warner. Will Verizon make an acquisition of its own to narrow the gap? It's unclear, but the company is certainly investing in next-generation wireless technology, with plans to begin testing a 5G network in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Business software specialist Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is worth $202.4 billion. Like almost every other tech company that's been successful for many years, Oracle has spent decades out-innovating (or sometimes acquiring) its disruptors. In recent years, this has included a shift to subscription models for software -- something Oracle is still working through -- and now the company is facing stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and other cloud-computing providers. Going forward, Oracle may have to prove its mettle all over again in the ever-important enterprise database segment it has dominated for years. The early results offer promise, but it's in the very early innings as the company's customers -- almost 40% of the market for enterprise database software -- begin to compare in-house systems to cloud-hosted alternatives. Image source: Citigroup. With a market cap of $198.4 billion, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is the last bank in the top 30 and the fourth-most valuable bank behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. With over 200 million global customers and 219,000 employees, Citigroup does business in 160 countries around the world. With its roots in the founding of City Bank of New York in 1812, it underwent a series of name changes over the next 160 years before finally becoming Citibank in 1976. The current Citigroup was formed when Citicorp -- Citibank's holding company -- merged with Travelers Group in 1998. Citigroup was one of the hardest-hit banks during the subprime crisis and Great Recession, with its significant exposure to bad mortgages -- both directly through its lending and through its investment in collateralized debt obligations -- which led to substantial losses, and eventually required federal government intervention to keep the bank from failing. This intervention and investment essentially wiped out investors in the company. Even after a pretty big recovery in the past decade, Citigroup investors from right before the financial crisis are still down about 75%. On the other side of the coin, anyone savvy -- or lucky -- enough to have invested in the company in March of 2009 and held their shares has seen a fourfold return on their investment. Image source: Novartis. Another Swiss pharmaceutical company on the list, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) rounds out the top 30 with a market cap of $198.2 billion. But unlike Roche, which was founded more than a century ago, Novartis is the result of multiple corporate mergers, though several of its legacy companies do date back to the 1800s. However, Novartis is similar to Roche in several regards. The company spent $7.9 billion on pharmaceutical research and development last year, second only to Roche in pharmaceutical R&D investment. Much of that spending is on development of biologics and immunotherapies, two of the areas of medicine with the most promise for treatments with fewer side effects and better results. With expectations that the company will file for approval of five new molecules in 2018, Novartis's R&D investments seem to be paying off. ","

282,24/7 Wall St.,12072017,MarketWatch,11302017,"Published: Dec 2, 2017 9:25 a.m. ET By It’s that time of year again, the time when all the top firms that we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. start to make their stock picks and prognostications for 2018. This not only gives investors a bit of a head start on year-end portfolio reshuffling, but it also gives them a look at what the overall macro thoughts for the coming year are at the big brokerages and banks. After another stellar year for the equity markets, the economy perking up, and the potential for growth the best in years, many investors are interested in the top picks for 2018 as the market has become very expensive. A new report from Merrill Lynch unveils the firm's top picks for 2018. All are good choices for growth accounts with a degree of risk tolerance, and are investment picks for the full year, as opposed to trading ideas. This large cap refining play could have big upside for 2018. Andeavor (NYSE: ANDV) is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. The company operates seven refineries concentrated in the Western United States with throughput capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day. The company’s retail marketing system sells gasoline and diesel fuel through retail stations, as well as through third-party dealers and distributors.

284,,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said it would publish new details about how climate change could affect its business in a move aimed at appeasing critics and forestalling another proxy fight next year. The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on “energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.” Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F) this century, surpassing a “tipping point” that a global climate deal aims to avert. Exxon’s statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company’s board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon’s long-term outlook. Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state’s comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday’s  decision “a win for shareholders and for the company’s ability to manage risk.” However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company’s statement. “This is giving no detail,” said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring’s resolution. He said Exxon’s statement “needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they’re responsive to last year’s request.” An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year  demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon’s May annual meeting. Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks. Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group  backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts. BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon. The report will carry weight beyond the company’s next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change. The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees’ Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday. Malinowski’s agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with “climate-competent” perspectives.

""Buy and hold"" is a great axiom on Wall Street, but it can be harder to pull off than many investors expect. That's because human nature has a bad habit of giving in to the temptations of the market. But if you step back and focus on owning great companies that pay you to own them, then you increase your chances of sticking it out through good times and bad. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) are two companies that you can buy today at good prices and collect  dividends while you hold them for at least the next decade. Integrated energy giant ExxonMobil's shares have fallen about 8% this year. Many of its peers are actually up. That suggests that something is wrong at Exxon, which simply isn't true. The company continues to chug along just like it always has. The best example of that is the fact that its dividend was raised again in the second quarter. Its streak of annual increases is up to 35 years -- an incredible record given the highly volatile nature of the energy business. Don't confuse the price of a stock with the value of what you're getting. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, no other major oil company has a dividend record that can match what Exxon has done. Most peers hit the pause button on dividend growth, or cut their dividends, after oil hit the skids in mid-2014. While dividends give you something to hold on to in the tough times, they aren't the entire story here. For example, Exxon continues to be toward the top of the pack when it comes to return on invested capital, a metric that tracks how well a company manages the money of its investors. But the company's astute financial stewardship goes beyond that. The balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry as well, with less leverage than its peers. That's true despite Exxon making a huge increase in its debt during the downturn to help support its capital investment plans and the dividend. But, even at the worst, long-term debt only made up about 15% of the capital structure. That's down to around 12% as of the third quarter, since recovering oil prices have allowed Exxon to start paring its debt levels. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. But here's the best part: Exxon's yield is a pleasing 3.7% today. And it's trading near its lowest price to tangible book value in a decade. So now looks like a good time to step aboard what remains one of the best-run companies in the energy industry. Next up is protein-focused Hormel, a food company that's probably best known for making Spam. But don't let that iconic name fool you, Hormel does a lot more than make potted meat. Its business spans the retail sector (roughly 65% of sales), the food service space (27%), and increasingly, foreign markets (5%). And it has the No. 1 or 2 position in 35 grocery categories across the entire store. Hormel makes more products than you might think. Image source: Hormel Foods Corp. Hormel's dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for over 50 consecutive years. That's a record that few public companies can match, let alone Hormel's direct peers. The stock has rebounded lately, but it's still down around 15% from its early 2016 highs. The yield is around 2%, which is toward the high end of its historical range. Concerns about shifting consumer preferences are largely to blame for the stock's troubles -- but that's an industrywide issue (Hormel's sales were down 4% in fiscal 2017). Hormel, however, is taking significant steps to keep up with the changes. Over the last few years it has sold assets that weren't living up to growth expectations (like its salt business) and bought ones that have brighter futures or complement its existing assets. The list here includes the acquisitions of Wholly Guacamole, Skippy Peanut Butter, and Columbus in the retail segment; Fontanini in the food service space; and Ceratti to expand its business into South America. It recently completed a major facility expansion in China, as well. This is not a company that's sitting still. And it has a track record of success, highlighted by that incredible dividend streak. Over the near term I would expect lingering weakness in sales and for debt levels to move higher because of the recent acquisition activity. But if you can handle that near-term uncertainty, this Dividend Aristocrat looks like it's trading at a fair price today. There's no question that Exxon and Hormel are facing headwinds, but both are managing them well -- just like they always have. Their impressive dividend streaks are all the proof you need of that. And while the stocks are down, that's actually an opportunity here for you to pick up great companies that you can own for at least the next decade. Focus on collecting all of those quarterly dividend checks (or reinvesting them) while everyone else worries about the gyrations of the market that don't change the fundamental stories for these stocks..

286,24/7 Wall St.,12142017,MarketWatch,12072017,"Published: Dec 8, 2017 7:45 a.m. ET By Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) has been a serious Dow Jones Industrial Average laggard in 2017. The fall from grace has been monumental considering that Exxon has a market value of close to $350 billion and that it is one of the top oil and gas players in the world. It is the largest in the United States by far, and investors need to be considering how they should evaluate the company ahead. 24/7 Wall St. has recently conducted preliminary 2018 reviews for what to expect ahead. Exxon was one of five surprise Dow winners for 2018. With its shares trading at $82.50, Exxon's consensus analyst target price of $84.68 does not exactly scream ""Buy me, please!"" But if you add in Exxon’s 3.7% dividend, the implied total return forecast for the coming 12 months would only be about 6%. Investing in oil comes with many risks. The obvious one is the debate over climate change. And regardless of that debate, the trends toward higher electric and hybrid vehicle use are expected to grow more each year in the future. And nations like China and the United Kingdom have pledged to reach the end of the combustion engine out in 2040 or so. Exxon shares have been range-bound for years, and the bulk of the past five years has seen a range of $80 to $90. There are no assurances that Exxon will emerge as a top performing Dow stock in 2018. It could even trade lower, particularly if oil prices begin to head lower again. But what if all the caution and concerns can be overcome? Most investors ended up being disappointed after Exxon spent $31 billion for its acquisition of XTO Energy. This gave Exxon a deep footing into natural gas, and natural gas development has finally been coming back after years of stagnation. That has not yet been a positive for Exxon in general, even in 2017. But that may be close to a change. Natural gas production is now forecast to continue growing in the United States in 2018, led by strong export demand and utilities. This non-event valuation for XTO of the $31 billion purchase price is almost 10% of the company's entire total value. What if natural gas finally becomes a big contributor for Exxon in the years ahead? Exxon's energy outlook out to 2040 shows rising natural gas demand. The firm projected that liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports around the globe will increase by 170% from current levels by 2040. And the United States is expected to lead the share of that growth with a 30% share. Also worth noting as a development ahead is that Exxon is set to merge its refining and marketing companies into ExxonMobil Fuels &amp; Lubricants Company. That move is planned for the first quarter of 2018. 24/7 Wall St. looked over the most recent analyst calls on Exxon. it is interesting that the consensus price target of analysts from Thomson Reuters has risen of late. The current $84.68 consensus target price was up from $84.00 a month earlier and from just under $83 two months ago. That might not sound very aggressive by today's bull market standards, but when analysts start raising their price targets then that consensus estimate tends to keep rising until something changes in the overall picture. Still, Exxon has undershot its 2017 Bull/Bear Outlook. The current street-high price target for Exxon is $100. In an effort to show both sides of the coin, we have included recent analyst calls that show positive views and cautious views on Exxon. Barclays kept its price target on Exxon north of $90. The firm noted that, after a long absence from Brazil, Exxon has plunged back in and recently won 12 exploration blocks of about 2 million gross acres in September. It and Petrobras were the biggest winners. Merrill Lynch still has a Buy rating and $94 price objective. The firm's assumption assumes long-term Brent at $53 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $55 per barrel. In November, RBC Capital Markets lowered Exxon's target price to $85 from $90. The firm noted that the dividend may be attractive versus the market, but it argued that this is not the full picture. RBC noted that cash flow generation has been resilient but peers have seen the same. The upside risk for capital spending also was shown to be a risk to future stock buybacks. Societe Generale issued its report on Exxon after the most recent earnings report with a Buy rating and a $95 price target. While that target had been handily over $100 in years past, the firm believes that Wall Street is not giving it a fair value for the Permian and Bakken, operating and lease captures, and technical capabilities. The downstream and chemicals business was also highlighted as a positive. Early in November, HSBC lowered Exxon to Reduce from Hold. The firm favored rival Shell in its call. While CFRA (S&amp;P) only has a Hold rating, the firm noted that it sees operating earnings of $3.53 per share in 2017, improving to $3.64 in 2018. These estimates compare with 2016 operating earnings of $2.36 per share. Another caveat in evaluating Exxon and any other large integrated oil and gas companies in 2018 is something taking place a few thousand miles away. The huge Saudi Aramco IPO will bring a lot of attention, and if it is really going to be valued at $1 trillion or more, then some oil and gas investors may decide to use at least a portion of their other oil and gas stock bets as a source of funds. Again, there are no assurances that Exxon (and other oil and gas giants) will do well in 2018. But considering that its stock has been range-bound for so long and that the current consensus target is rising, some investors might want to take a closer look here.

Examples of biofuels include ethanol (often made from corn in the United States and sugarcane in Brazil), biodiesel (vegetable oils and liquid animal fats), green diesel (derived from algae and other plant sources) and biogas (methane derived from animal manure and other digested organic material). Biofuels are most useful in liquid or gas form because they are easier to transport, deliver and burn cleanly. Many in the energy industry view biofuel as vitally important to future energy production because of its clean and renewable properties. Ironically, most of the major oil companies are investing millions of dollars in advanced biofuel research. America's largest oil company, ExxonMobil, says they are funding a broad portfolio of biofuels research programs including ongoing efforts on algae as well as programs on converting alternative, non-food-based biomass feedstocks, i.e., cellulosic biomass, to advanced biofuels. They warn, however, that fundamental technology improvements and scientific breakthroughs are still necessary in both biomass optimization and the processing of biomass into viable fuels. (For more, read The Biofuels Debate Heats Up.) Individuals concerned about energy security and carbon dioxide emissions see biofuels as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. However, biofuels also have shortcomings. For example, it takes more ethanol than gasoline to produce the same amount of energy, and critics contend that ethanol use is extremely wasteful because the production of ethanol actually creates a net energy loss while also increasing food prices. Biofuels have also become a point of contention for conservation groups that argue bio-crops would go to better use as a source of food rather than fuel. Specific concerns center around the use of large amounts of arable land that are required to produce bio-crops, leading to problems such as soil erosion, deforestation, fertilizer run-off and salinity. To help mitigate the problem of large arable land use, companies like ExxonMobil are turning to water-based solutions in the form of algae production. Exxon claims that algae can be cultivated on land unsuitable for other purposes with water that can’t be used for food production. In addition to using non-arable land and not requiring the use of fresh water, algae could potentially yield greater volumes of biofuels per acre than other sources. The other advantage to using algae over other bio-sources is that the algae can be used to manufacture biofuels similar in composition to today’s transportation fuels. This would go a long way to replacing the conventional fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel used today. ",Biofuel,0.9924
291,Rebecca Ungarino,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"A handful of names in this year's so-called dogs of the Dow collection strike some strategists as buys. The classic investment strategy works like this: investors ought to buy the 10 Dow stocks carrying the highest dividend yields, and hold on to them for one year. High dividend yields traditionally point to falling prices, thus the ""dog"" moniker. This year, the names topping the list are Verizon, IBM, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Pfizer; Merck, Coca-Cola, Cisco, Procter & Gamble and General Electric finish off the list. Notably, shares of GE have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and its dividend sits at 2.7 percent. At this juncture, Chevron and Exxon Mobil are attractive picks to David Seaburg of Cowen. ""I'm not saying rotate in massively, but I do think ... you're going to start to see some generalist money flow in there, which could keep those names elevated or actually help them work out. Good dividend, solid cash flow; those are two names that I would probably take a swing at,"" Seaburg said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Chevron has risen nearly 3 percent year to date, vastly underperforming the broader market. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil has fallen 8 percent in the same period. Procter & Gamble, which boasts a dividend yield of 3 percent, is one attractive ""dog,"" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. ""Not only has this been a dog of the Dow this year, but it's been underperforming for two years in a row,"" Maley said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation."" Indeed, while the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 20 percent this year, Procter & Gamble has risen 9 percent. ""On a technical basis, the stock is getting back up to its $194, $195 level. That's kind of its double-top from late 2014 and earlier this year. If that can break above that level, that's going to be very positive on a technical basis,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Social stocks have gotten slammed, but one has survived the social media meltdown: Twitter. The charts could be setting up for an even bigger pop for the social network. The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter. Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Michael Bapis of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management discuss whether the stock is a social safety trade. Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global says a North Korean attack, should one occur, isn't likely to cause significant long-term market impact. Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management says the ISM non-manufacturing report is key to watch ahead the jobs data released Friday.

Here's something crazy to consider. In 2017, the average price per barrel of Brent crude oil -- the international benchmark price -- is up more than 15%. At the same time, though, the oil and gas industry as a whole is one of the worst-performing sectors this year. If that sounds odd to you, you aren't the only one. While there are some reasons this may be the case -- domestic crude prices are only up 6% over the same time frame -- it is still hard to imagine that the industry as a whole would suffer when the price of its most precious commodity has risen so much. With this in mind, it seems like it's a good time for investors to start digging into the oil and gas industry for possible stock ideas. So, we asked three of our investing contributors which stocks they like right now. Here's why they picked Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Transocean (NYSE:RIG). Image source: Getty Images. Sean O'Reilly (Diamondback Energy): What a difference a year makes. Last Thanksgiving, OPEC finally relented and cut production in an attempt to balance the oil market. The cartel even moved to extend production cuts through the end of 2018. This landmark reversal, made in partnership with Russia, marks a tectonic shift. The sun may be about to shine on the oil industry once again. And that makes hyperefficient oil companies like Diamondback Energy compelling investments today. Diamondback is one of the major players in the Permian Basin of West Texas. This particularly fertile geologic basin has been a favorite of the oil industry. Its proximity to the Port of Houston, and its bountiful, low-cost reserves, make it ""ground zero"" of the shale revolution. Diamondback is not only one of the most prominent owners of oil leases there, but is one of the lowest-cost producers. Over the past three years, Diamondback has cut its cash operating expenses per barrel of production by over 35%. On average, it can now produce a barrel of oil for less than $9. Diamondback Energy will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of an oil rebound. While many have been selling assets and cutting costs to survive, Diamondback has used the past four years to expand. It has done so by buying up assets and focusing on reducing costs; Diamondback could not have managed the energy downturn of the last four years any better. With its stock at just 18 times forward earnings estimates, and with industry-leading efficiency, Diamondback Energy is a fantastic oil stock to buy this December. Reuben Gregg Brewer (ExxonMobil Corporation): Shares of integrated energy giant Exxon are down around 7% so far this year. Many of its peers, on the other hand, are up for the year, some in the low double digits. But it's not like Exxon is suddenly struggling. In fact, it's doing just fine, with third-quarter earnings of $0.93 a share. But that's really par for the course; while many of Exxon's competitors were bleeding red ink during the oil downturn, this industry giant remained in the black. Now that oil prices have risen from their lows to above the $50-per-barrel level, Exxon looks like it's being left behind. However, there have been no material fundamental changes at the company, and investors seem to be overlooking growth opportunities like its efforts in the Permian Basin and offshore Guyana. In fact, at this point, Exxon is trading near its lowest ratio of price to tangible net worth in roughly a decade. Meanwhile, Exxon was one of the few oil companies to manage through the energy downturn with its streak of annual dividend increases intact (it's now up to 35 years). It also maintains one of the least leveraged balance sheets, with long-term debt at just 12% (or so) of the capital structure. And while peers are starting to close the gap with regard to return on invested capital, it's still at the high end of the group. Exxon looks cheap today, but I don't expect that to last as investors realize that this industry stalwart continues to perform at the top of its game. Brent Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts. Tyler Crowe (Transocean): Even though the oil and gas industry has been slowly recovering over the past year or so, much of the recovery has happened in North American shale. At current prices, companies can at least break even, and in some cases make a respectable return. This has spurred an uptick in spending for land drilling, and all the associated services and equipment for this particular part of the market. Outside land drilling, there hasn't been much progress. Even though some companies are learning how to develop offshore sources for less money and faster than ever before, offshore fields still tie up lots of capital over several years -- money that could go to projects that can return capital much faster. As much as this trend has held for a few years, chances are it won't last forever. The North American shale industry can't singlehandedly offset global production decline and underinvestment. Eventually, producers will find a price range where spending on offshore developments is once again lucrative. When that time comes, Transocean will be one of the companies producers turn to for an offshore drilling rig. Throughout this downturn in offshore activity, the company has undertaken an incredible fleet turnover program to shed itself of older, less capable rigs. As a result, a vast majority of Transocean's fleet is designed to handle either the deepest drilling waters or the harsh environments of the North Sea and Arctic regions. These rigs command higher service rates and higher margins, and Transocean has a lot of them ready to deploy --and the balance sheet to ride out the middle to late innings of this industry downturn. What makes Transocean's stock so compelling is the fact that it trades so cheap. At a price-to-tangible-book-value ratio of only 0.3, the market is pricing shares for pennies on the dollar of its underlying assets. Wall Street's fear here is that the anticipated recovery may never materialize. That isn't inconceivable, but the possible returns that would come from a recovery make this a high-reward stock worth a deeper dive. ","
      
    3 Top Oil Stocks to Buy in December -- The Motley Fool

293,Reuben Gregg Brewer,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""Buy and hold"" is a great axiom on Wall Street, but it can be harder to pull off than many investors expect. That's because human nature has a bad habit of giving in to the temptations of the market. But if you step back and focus on owning great companies that pay you to own them, then you increase your chances of sticking it out through good times and bad. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) are two companies that you can buy today at good prices and collect  dividends while you hold them for at least the next decade. Integrated energy giant ExxonMobil's shares have fallen about 8% this year. Many of its peers are actually up. That suggests that something is wrong at Exxon, which simply isn't true. The company continues to chug along just like it always has. The best example of that is the fact that its dividend was raised again in the second quarter. Its streak of annual increases is up to 35 years -- an incredible record given the highly volatile nature of the energy business. Don't confuse the price of a stock with the value of what you're getting. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, no other major oil company has a dividend record that can match what Exxon has done. Most peers hit the pause button on dividend growth, or cut their dividends, after oil hit the skids in mid-2014. While dividends give you something to hold on to in the tough times, they aren't the entire story here. For example, Exxon continues to be toward the top of the pack when it comes to return on invested capital, a metric that tracks how well a company manages the money of its investors. But the company's astute financial stewardship goes beyond that. The balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry as well, with less leverage than its peers. That's true despite Exxon making a huge increase in its debt during the downturn to help support its capital investment plans and the dividend. But, even at the worst, long-term debt only made up about 15% of the capital structure. That's down to around 12% as of the third quarter, since recovering oil prices have allowed Exxon to start paring its debt levels. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. But here's the best part: Exxon's yield is a pleasing 3.7% today. And it's trading near its lowest price to tangible book value in a decade. So now looks like a good time to step aboard what remains one of the best-run companies in the energy industry. Next up is protein-focused Hormel, a food company that's probably best known for making Spam. But don't let that iconic name fool you, Hormel does a lot more than make potted meat. Its business spans the retail sector (roughly 65% of sales), the food service space (27%), and increasingly, foreign markets (5%). And it has the No. 1 or 2 position in 35 grocery categories across the entire store. Hormel makes more products than you might think. Image source: Hormel Foods Corp. Hormel's dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for over 50 consecutive years. That's a record that few public companies can match, let alone Hormel's direct peers. The stock has rebounded lately, but it's still down around 15% from its early 2016 highs. The yield is around 2%, which is toward the high end of its historical range. Concerns about shifting consumer preferences are largely to blame for the stock's troubles -- but that's an industrywide issue (Hormel's sales were down 4% in fiscal 2017). Hormel, however, is taking significant steps to keep up with the changes. Over the last few years it has sold assets that weren't living up to growth expectations (like its salt business) and bought ones that have brighter futures or complement its existing assets. The list here includes the acquisitions of Wholly Guacamole, Skippy Peanut Butter, and Columbus in the retail segment; Fontanini in the food service space; and Ceratti to expand its business into South America. It recently completed a major facility expansion in China, as well. This is not a company that's sitting still. And it has a track record of success, highlighted by that incredible dividend streak. Over the near term I would expect lingering weakness in sales and for debt levels to move higher because of the recent acquisition activity. But if you can handle that near-term uncertainty, this Dividend Aristocrat looks like it's trading at a fair price today. There's no question that Exxon and Hormel are facing headwinds, but both are managing them well -- just like they always have. Their impressive dividend streaks are all the proof you need of that. And while the stocks are down, that's actually an opportunity here for you to pick up great companies that you can own for at least the next decade. Focus on collecting all of those quarterly dividend checks (or reinvesting them) while everyone else worries about the gyrations of the market that don't change the fundamental stories for these stocks..

It didn’t turn out that way, as the price stalled in March and then again in May and June: The four-year chart gives a broad perspective: This chart shows oil price changes and the total return for the S&P 1500 energy sector over the past 12 months: On Aug. 22, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in his daily energy report that “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply” because of OPEC’s production cuts and “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a surprising increase in gasoline prices, along with an expected decline in U.S. oil supplies. After expressing doubt that U.S. gasoline supplies jumped during the Thanksgiving holiday break, Flynn said on Wednesday that “it is very disturbing that week after week we have to continue to question the accuracy of these weekly figures.” So we may once again be in for some volatility, and can expect the EIA to release revised figures.

295,,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"NEW YORK/TEPIC, Mexico (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lawyers and advocates stepped up the fight against climate change this year by pursuing a rising number of legal cases around the world that aim to test the limits of national laws. Climate change cases numbered nearly 900 in 24 nations as of March, according to a survey by UN Environment and Columbia Law School, marking a steady increase in lawsuits filed to hold governments and companies to account over carbon pollution. They include a handful of milestone suits that charge violations of various states’ constitutions. Here are five cases whose outcomes, some expected in the coming year, could reshape the roles and responsibilities of governments and businesses in tackling climate change: - URGENDA FOUNDATION V. KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS (NETHERLANDS) This landmark case energized the climate movement in 2015 when a district court sided with the nearly 900 Dutch citizens behind it, ordering their government to cut greenhouse has emissions faster. It was “one of the most important climate change decisions ever issued”, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law in New York. But the outcome is now being appealed and a decision could be handed down as early as 2018, said Gerrard. The Urgenda ruling remains the only one of its kind globally to declare a government’s obligation to control climate change. It did so by citing the Dutch constitution, prompting a flurry of similar complaints worldwide where plaintiffs are trying to enlist their nations’ founding principles to curb global warming. - JULIANA V. UNITED STATES (UNITED STATES) Trial in this federal suit filed by a group of 21 U.S. teenagers could begin in February 2018. Building on the precedent established by the Urgenda case, the young people from Oregon charge their government’s climate policy is inadequate and flouts their constitutional right to live in a habitable atmosphere. The case is currently stalled amid efforts by the U.S. government - fearful it will lead to a constitutional crisis - to prevent it going forward. “It’s clearly a case to watch,” said Sean Hecht, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA in California. “It would be extraordinary for a judge to take the step of holding the U.S. government responsible for this, but it’s not unthinkable,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. - LLIUYA V. RWE (GERMANY) A Peruvian farmer, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, is seeking $20,000 in damages from a large German energy utility based half-way around the world. Lliuya argues that RWE AG holds some responsibility - by emitting planet-warming gases - for the melting of glaciers and rising water level of a lake near his Andean town. Observers are calling the Lliuya suit, which is due to hear evidence in 2018, a test case of whether a company can be held financially liable for its contribution to the effects of climate change in other parts of the world. - EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION V. MAURA TRACY HEALEY (UNITED STATES) Exxon Mobil is battling attorney generals in Massachusetts and New York who are investigating the oil giant, after news reports charged in 2015 that its own scientists had found cutting fossil fuel use was needed to slow down climate change. Exxon’s case against Massachusetts’ attorney general Maura Healey and a similar one against her New York counterpart seek to derail subpoenas to obtain the company’s internal documents on climate science. “There’s a lot at stake because these companies are very concerned about potential liability,” said UCLA’s Hecht. - GREENPEACE NORDIC V. GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY (NORWAY) In another case rooted in a constitutional argument, this lawsuit charges that Norway violated the country’s constitution by letting energy firms explore for oil and gas in the Arctic Barents Sea. With a judgment expected in January, a win by Greenpeace would “re-energize similar litigations in other countries”, said Columbia Law School’s Gerrard.

299,Sean Williams,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It may be hard to believe, but it's the truth: Cryptocurrencies are considerably closer to hitting $1 trillion in total value than $100 billion in value. When the year began, the combined market cap of all virtual currencies was just $17.7 billion, and bitcoin made up nearly 88% of that total. However, as of Dec. 20, the aggregate market cap of the better than 1,360 digital currencies had soared to $635 billion, representing a year-to-date increase of almost 3,500%, and bitcoin's contribution was less than 50%. By comparison, the stock market historically gains about 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment and adjusted for inflation. Cryptocurrencies have simply whupped traditional equities in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Why such bullishness, you ask? A number of catalysts have played a role in pushing virtual currencies higher. For example, the emergence of blockchain is creating a lot of buzz on Wall Street. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. Think of it as the infrastructure that underlies digital currencies like bitcoin. Blockchain has the potential to speed up transaction settlement times, reduce transaction fees, and could be considerably more secure than current databases, just to name a few advantages. Dollar weakness has also been helpful, especially to bitcoin. A falling dollar is great news for U.S. exporters, but it's not such positive news for investors holding cash. These investors will often seek the safety of gold as a store of value, given gold's scarcity and use as a currency for more than 2,700 years. Yet some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, have protocols that limit the number of coins that can be mined. This creates the perception of scarcity, which has pushed some investors to choose bitcoin, or other cryptos, over traditional commodities, like gold. Emotions are clearly playing a role, too. The fear of missing out, or ""FOMO,"" and watching everyone else make money has coerced both novice and experienced investors into buying cryptocurrencies. Image source: Getty Images. As you might imagine, the buzz is almost always about bitcoin -- and with good reason. It comprises nearly 46% of the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap, is the most popular virtual coin in the world, was the first tradable digital currency, and is accepted by more merchants relative to any other cryptocurrency. Yet, if you ask this investor, it's pretty far down the list of cryptocurrencies worth considering for purchase. Bitcoin, and Litecoin, for that matter, are laser-focused on growing their partnerships with merchants, and have largely ignored the enterprise-based application of their blockchains. While there's value to be had as a means of money transmittance, I personally believe that blockchain is where the bigger long-term opportunity lies. As such, I believe the following three cryptocurrencies may be worth buying over bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. There's a good reason why Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap: It has a really popular blockchain. Formed earlier this year, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is comprised of 200 organizations that are currently testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in demo, pilot, and small-scale projects. These testers include governments, financial-service companies (which are expected to be the biggest benefactor of blockchain technology), and tech and energy companies. What makes Ethereum really stand out is its incorporation of smart contracts, which help facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. While Ethereum's blockchain is somewhat similar to that of bitcoin, these smart contract protocols allow it to move beyond currency-only applications. Its blockchain could be used to store information about an application, or can function as a multi-signature account that allows money to be spent when a certain percentage of people agree. Or in the case of integrated oil and gas giant BP (NYSE:BP), it could speed up transaction settlement times to improve energy futures trading efficiency. The one knock on Ethereum is that its coin, Ether, is almost exclusively used to cover transaction fees and doesn't have a clear path, like bitcoin, to being accepted by merchants. Again, I believe the smarter path for the Ethereum Foundation is to focus on blockchain, which is what they're doing, but it's unclear how exactly the Ether coin ties into its future. Image source: Getty Images. Another cryptocurrency that's been very impressive of late is Ripple. Its token, the XRP, has galloped higher by more than 12,000% since the year began. As with Ethereum, the buzz here is all about the company's blockchain technology. But unlike Ethereum, which is partnering with a number of industries, Ripple is focused on becoming the go-to blockchain for the financial-services industry. The company's blockchain offers the ability to rapidly proof payments and transactions, which could drastically improve the time it takes for settlement. In particular, Ripple's blockchain may offer the potential for instantaneous cross-border payments and transactions. In June 2016, Ripple announced that four major banks were testing out its distributed ledger technology in some small capacity: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, UBS, Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN), and Unicredit. But it wasn't until Nov. 2017 that Ripple really put itself on the radar. American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Banco Santander announced that they were partnering to test Ripple's blockchain in non-card cross-border payments across AmEx's FX International Payment network to U.K. Santander accounts. These payments are expected to process instantly. What's more, it looks like the XRP is going to play a vital role in the growth of Ripple's blockchain. In particular, it could be used as an intermediary in cross-border transactions that allows for one currency, say Japanese yen, to be exchanged to another currency, like the euro, instantly. Ripple is certainly worth keeping a close eye on, and it looks to be far more intriguing than bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. Sticking with the theme that blockchain is king, one under-the-radar cryptocurrency you should be following is Stellar (formerly Stellar Lumens), and its coin, the XLM. This is a virtual currency that holds true to its name, as the XLM has been ""stellar"" this year with a 10,400% year-to-date gain. Stellar's focus is similar to that of Ripple: building financial products for transactions around the globe. In other words, it's targeting enterprise clients with high volumes of cross-border transactions. But whereas Ripple is sinking its teeth into big banks and financial-service companies, Stellar is looking at servicing multinational corporations that conduct billions in revenue outside of their home country. Stellar's blockchain suggests that cross-border payments could settle in just two-to-five seconds. What's more, Stellar also incorporates smart contract protocols into its blockchain. Though they aren't exactly the same as Ethereum's, they nonetheless are an attractive addition for enterprise customers. In October, Stellar announced a partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and KlickEx to facilitate quicker cross-border transactions. IBM generates tens of billions of dollars from global clients, signaling that this could be Stellar's opportunity to prove the value of its blockchain to other multinationals. Currently, a dozen banks in the South Pacific region are deploying this project, with IBM expected to scale the project beyond this region if it's successful. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the word ""consider"" is paramount with all three of these cryptocurrencies. While this investor views them as far more intriguing over the long run than bitcoin, I wouldn't suggest chasing these valuations at this time. The risks in cryptocurrencies are aplenty, and it wouldn't take much for this bubble to burst. ","

302,Fred Imbert,4272017,CNBC,4202017,"U.S. equities soared on Monday as investors cheered the results of the first round in the French presidential election. ""The market really seemed to like"" the election outcome, said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. ""It really surprised me because the other candidate is Le Pen and she's the sleeper candidate."" The Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 200 points, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 popped about 1 percent, with financials surging more than 2 percent to lead advancers. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) and the Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both rose more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq composite posted record highs on an intraday and closing basis, rising more than 1 percent. Early results from the French election showed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen advancing to a presidential runoff. Far-right candidate Le Pen and centrist Macron were largely expected to pull ahead in the first round of the French contest. The two had led most of the polls leading up to the election. Le Pen and Macron will face off again on May 7. Most polls show Macron easily beating Le Pen in the second round. ""While I don't believe the US stock market was worried whatsoever about the French election in terms of its pricing and recent action ... it's clear that we dodged a bullet with the high likelihood of a Macron Presidency,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. European stock markets skyrocketed across the board, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index popping about 2 percent. The French CAC 40 rose 4.14 percent and hit a nine-year high. The euro also rose sharply against most major currencies. The common currency briefly broke above $1.09 against the U.S. dollar and last traded around 1.3 percent higher at $1.087. Macron ""is the prohibitive favorite to win the presidency in two weeks thereby leaving far too little time for his challenger to make up any significant ground,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""Although the outcome hardly qualifies as a surprise, investors breathed a huge sigh of relief."" U.S. stock futures rose more than 1 percent in the premarket. ""We've certainly seen the French election give risk assets a boost,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets. ""But now you're seeing the narrative shift almost immediately to the possibility of a government shutdown."" That said, investors are also staring down the barrel of a potential government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. The last time the government shut down was Oct. 1 through 16, 2013. During that time, the S&P 500 rose about 1.6 percent, but not without some volatility. The index moved more than 1 percent three times in that time period. ""There's a lot of anxiety over a government shutdown. One would hope we learned from the last time we went through this,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. The possibility of a shutdown comes as President Donald Trump is about to conclude his first 100 days in office. On Monday, Dow Jones reported that Trump ordered aides to put together a tax plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Expectations of tax reform have been one of the pillars of the stock market's postelection. Wall Street also braced itself for a busy week of earnings. About 200 S&P components are set to report this week, including Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft and 3M. Of the 95 S&P 500 companies that have reported as of Monday morning, 77 percent exceeded earnings expectations, according to data from The Earnings Scout. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 216.13 points, or 1.05 percent, to close at 20,763.89, with JPMorgan Chase outperforming and Nike the top decliners. The S&P 500 gained 25.46 points, or 1.08 percent, to end at 2,374.15, with financials leading nine sectors higher and real estate and telecommunications lagging. The Nasdaq advanced 73.30 points, or 1.24 percent, to close at 5,983.82. About three stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 907.07 million and a composite volume of 3.647 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 10.9, down 25.6 percent.

303,Sean Williams,4272017,Fool,4202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is one of the America's oldest stock indexes, and it's easily the country's most iconic. It's comprised of 30 huge multinational corporations, all of which have demonstrated a penchant for creating shareholder value over the long run. Image source: Getty Images. For example, conglomerate General Electric is the sixth-largest company represented in the Dow, with a market cap of roughly $260 billion. But its share price is less than $30. Based on the current Dow divisor, which translates the share prices of Dow components into the point value that we follow as investors, GE's share price contributes just 202 of the Dow's 20,548 points, the closing value as of Friday, April 21. That's not even a full 1%. Yet, a company we'll be discussing in a moment that has just 30% of the market cap of GE also has seven times its influence in the Dow, all because of share price. In fact, through Friday, the Dow would be 308 points higher if the following three companies were merely flat for the year instead of down between 9% and 11%. Though it doesn't happen often, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed Wall Street's expectations by a wide margin in the first quarter, and that's the primary reason it's shaved nearly 155 points off the Dow year to date. It's also the aforementioned company that has seven times as much influence on the Dow as GE based solely on its share price. Image source: Getty Images. For the first quarter, Goldman wound up reporting $5.15 per share in EPS on $8.03 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Wall Street was looking for $420 million more in revenue and $0.16 more in earnings per share. Goldman attributed its subpar results to weakness in certain market segments. For instance, even though investment banking revenue scorched higher by 16% year over year, revenue from fixed income was flat, while equity revenue dipped 6% on account of weaker volumes in the United States. The low interest rate environment continues to hold back Goldman Sachs, which is listed as a bank in name, but is really an investment institution by practice. The good news is that at least the Federal Reserve is in the midst of tightening monetary policy, albeit slowly. As rates rise, investor demand for fixed-income assets will likely improve as well. This should reduce market volatility and give the king of bonds, Goldman Sachs, some healthy profits. But it's going to take time before the bond market is a boon once again for Goldman Sachs. In the interim, it's been quite the drag on the Dow in 2017. Integrated oil and gas companies have regularly taken it on the chin over the past three years. Surprisingly, though, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has held up better than many of its peers. Its geographic diversity and ability to cut costs probably played a key role in its ability to withstand sinking crude oil prices. Image source: Getty Images. However, in 2017 Chevron has been notably weaker. On a pure percentage basis, Chevron is the worst-performing stock in the Dow year to date, and it's removed almost 88 Dow points. The failure of crude prices to move higher is one reason Chevron is struggling. Despite cuts from OPEC that were expected to reduce supply and help buoy crude prices, U.S. crude and gasoline inventories hit an all-time record high in mid-February. This picture paints the need for more production cuts in the future, and more importantly, shows there is no quick fix for crude oil prices. The other issue for Chevron is that its fourth-quarter earnings results, released earlier this year, weren't very encouraging. Despite the company's $415 million in net income during Q4 2016, there were a handful of disappointments. For instance, Chevron's operating cash flow is still not high enough to cover the costs of paying out its dividend. Chevron has admittedly worked hard to become a Dividend Aristocrat (i.e., a company that's increased its payout for 25 or more consecutive years) and likely doesn't want to give up that title, but it's being forced to issue debt to cover a portion of its payouts at the moment. Additionally, the company's U.S. downstream operations produced no earnings as a result of a 21% decline in per-day output, which Chevron blamed on planned turnaround activity at its refinery in Richmond, California. The good news for investors is that Chevron still has plenty of cost-cutting channels left, as well as numerous projects that are poised to boost production over the long term. However, an ongoing crude supply glut is a problem that isn't likely to be resolved anytime soon. Finally, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is in much the same boat as Chevron. Its stock has held up far better than many of its peers, but rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories clearly have investors concerned. This year hasn't been so kind to big oil stocks, with ExxonMobil removing more than 65 points from the Dow in 2017. Image source: Pixabay. Though ExxonMobil's fourth-quarter report was a bit more upbeat than Chevron's -- after all, it was able to cover its dividend payouts with cash flow generated from operations and asset sales -- it still came with some clear downsides. For instance, ExxonMobil wound up taking an impairment charge of about $2 billion in its U.S. upstream segment that was tied to undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains. The company also saw its full-year 2016 earnings hit by weaker refining margins, although this was a sectorwide issue last year. And, for those shareholders who've become accustomed to ExxonMobil being exceptionally generous with share buybacks, there's been a notable decline in the number of shares it's repurchasing. Like Chevron, ExxonMobil has the ability to reduce its expenditures to account for weakened demand or modestly lower commodity prices. Its Q4 2016 capital expenditures were down 35% from the prior-year quarter, to $4.8 billion. These are the types of steep cuts that may be needed if ExxonMobil wants to keep its healthy dividend firmly in place. ExxonMobil has ample projects underway to boost production in the years to come, but without oil industry dynamics favoring the company, it could be tough sledding in 2017. ","

These centers allow local residents to connect to online resources such as skills training. Cisco's management believes investments like these are critical to ending the cycle of poverty in these areas. Image source: Wells Fargo. While Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has certainly come under public scrutiny over its problematic account-selling tactics in the last few months, the company has long been regarded as one of the most charitable for-profit organizations in the U.S. Wells Fargo supports hundreds of local nonprofits in the cities where it operates, as well as large national nonprofits that are involved in financial education and much more. Wells Fargo management announced its 2020 economic goals last year, and they include $500 million in philanthropic spending by 2020. Image source: Eli Lilly.

It's also the parent of the Eli Lilly Foundation, which awards grants for philanthropic initiatives in the areas of quality healthcare in low- and middle-income countries, as well as public education in the United States, with an emphasis on science and math. The foundation also matches millions of dollars' worth of employee donations each year. Image source: Bristol-Myers Squibb. Healthcare company Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) says on its website that it seeks ""to improve the health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases"" through increasing healthcare worker capacity and integrated medical care.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates is not only one of the wealthiest people in the world, but also one of the most charitable -- he's the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated tens of billions toward the cause of improving healthcare and relieving poverty around the world. Microsoft seems to hold similar values, as the company notes that it donates nearly $2 million per day in cash and equipment. Its philosophy is that technology can help humankind overcome some of the greatest challenges it faces. In the image above, a Microsoft employee helps farmers in India use technology to better time their crops during a drought.

305,Taylor Muckerman and Sean O'Reilly,4272017,Fool,4202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Fracking is where it's at for U.S. oil production, but it's more than a little complicated. Also, the hosts look into the sudden seat change at Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), where CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has been abruptly ousted from his position by investment-management company Elliott Management. A full transcript follows the video. Taylor Muckerman: Sporting my red today, got a sweep yesterday, first series win. O'Reilly: You feeling good? Muckerman: Better. O'Reilly: Very good. I'm a Cleveland Indians fan. We're not going to talk about last year. Muckerman: I would talk about last year. You lost in Game 7, but you still went to the World Series. O'Reilly: How far did you guys get? Muckerman: Oh, funny. That's why I'm saying, I would want to talk about last year if I was you. O'Reilly: Thank you. If I were you? We need a couple of those editors from upstairs. Muckerman: Yeah, hold up paper on the glass. ""You said that wrong!"" O'Reilly: Use your commas! So, on today's show, we're going to walk our Foolish listeners through the fracking process. I know that sounds really attractive, doesn't it? Muckerman: We use the word a lot, but we haven't ever really described it. O'Reilly: That's true. And we'll, of course, mention a few interesting companies along the way, maybe some cool fracking sand companies. Muckerman: If our listeners ask politely. O'Reilly: We should have a chat sometime, ""Tweet at us right now if you want ... "" Muckerman: We could. We do live chats with our members. We could do a live stream using Slido. O'Reilly: Could we use Slido? Muckerman: Yeah, you just have to throw a password over the podcast, and if people listen to it they get treated with the password. Muckerman: No, then people who don't listen every week wouldn't be able to figure it out. O'Reilly: Yeah, OK. So we'll walk through the fracking process. But first, we have to briefly talk about what's going on with Arconic. Basically, this week, the sudden ouster of its CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. Arconic is the lightweight metals and engineering manufacturer. It's the successor -- Muckerman: Well, not successor, because Alcoa (NYSE:AA) still exists. O'Reilly: It spun off the original aluminum production operations, and this is the advanced stuff. So Alcoa took the name. Muckerman: Alcoa kept the aluminum production, and they spun off the aluminum products division into Arconic. O'Reilly: Yeah. It was interesting to me, because in every press release I've ever seen for this, or analysis, Arconic is not mentioned as a spinoff. It's just, ""We're separating, and that's it."" Muckerman: Yeah, I guess maybe not a spinoff, technically. O'Reilly: But bottom line, that's just semantics to this point. This happened about six months ago. The guy that steered Arconic through this process of becoming an individual company was, again, CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. Total surprise -- it was announced on April 17 that Kleinfeld has been forced out by investment manager Elliott Management. This is actually where it gets even weirder. Arconic said that Mr. Kleinfeld's exit came after he sent an unauthorized letter to Elliott Management, that Arconic's board of directors said showed poor judgement. The company then said that Mr. Kleinfeld is stepping down by mutual agreement. I don't know what was in this letter. That sounds awesome. If somebody knows, tweet at me, I guess. Elliott said in a statement that the letter from Mr. Kleinfeld ""read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of Elliott Management based on completely false insinuations, a threat that we took seriously and about which we immediately and privately informed the board."" Whoa. Muckerman: Yeah, I would believe them if they didn't already want him out of there for over a year. This is just their excuse. O'Reilly: That's the final cap on this whole -- Muckerman: They were probably poking the bear for a year, and he finally woke up from hibernation. O'Reilly: Arconic is going to have a shareholder meeting on May 16, and they had it on the docket to get him out. That letter, I want to know what's in that letter. That sounds insane, from a professional CEO of a large corporation. Muckerman: Yeah. If you're a shareholder of Alcoa -- because he's been the CEO of Alcoa before the split -- he pushed back against the split in 2012 and 2013, when the price of commodities started to fall, eventually succumbing to investors' demands, and successfully overseeing the split and then taking control as the CEO of Arconic. He's a visionary. He has long-term visions for Arconic, not these near-term visions that Elliott Management has. If you look at his success at Alcoa and Arconic now as a businessman and a relationship man with their customers, Boeing was going to go all composites, they were going to completely eliminate the aluminum products that they used from Alcoa and now Arconic. He had the CEO come to their plant, they hashed it out, and they proved that they needed to remain an Arconic customer. And it's one of their biggest contracts. And then you see the CEOs of Airbus, on top of Boeing, United Technologies, and to [General Electric] Aviation all voicing their support for Klaus Kleinfeld. But Elliott Management, they have some ulterior motives, some short-term motives, I'm sure. O'Reilly: This is not news, yeah. Muckerman: The stock did pop a little bit, but all these reports you see about his track record in the market for Alcoa, all say, ""Oh, this stock's done so poorly since he's been there!"" But they never mention the fact that the price of aluminum has also done quite poorly since he was CEO. Muckerman: Using Arconic's products. As Fools, we appreciate that, and as Fools, we don't appreciate, at least I don't appreciate, what happened. I'm going to keep my eye on him and see where he ends up. If he doesn't choose to retire, I think somebody is going to want him on their board, or in their C-suite. I'd be interested which company that is. Hopefully they're public so I can follow along. O'Reilly: We've been doing this for a year and a half together. We've talked a lot about fracking. It's kind of all we talk about. Muckerman: Well, it's what's disrupted the industry over the last decade or so, and it's what put American oil and natural gas back on the map. O'Reilly: I have a good friend who's a petroleum geologist. I remember when he was in school 10 years ago, he gave a presentation about this, and I happened to be on campus. I was just passing through. He was talking about this and how revolutionary it was. He was talking about -- we're going to talk about it in a second -- drilling sideways and all this stuff. It was a big deal, and we hadn't been able to do that until recently. So, first and foremost, we need to clarify some terms. Fracking is actually what happens after a well is drilled. We've been drilling oil wells for over a hundred years. Muckerman: The technology there has definitely improved, but it's not what fracking is. O'Reilly: Have you ever been to Drake's Well, Pa.? Muckerman: I haven't. That's the original, right? O'Reilly: It's so anticlimatic. Muckerman: Yeah, I'm sure. Kind of like the geyser in Yellowstone. Whatever, dude. O'Reilly: The actual well drilling, which, again, going down, we can now go 360 degrees around. That immediately makes any given oil well more valuable. You used to just drill a hole and oil would come up, and that would be it. Muckerman: And you would have to go straight down. But we're going up to 10,000, maybe even a little further down now. O'Reilly: I saw this graphic, and they had Empire State Buildings down. Muckerman: Yeah, multiple Empire State Buildings. O'Reilly: Yeah, they had, like, five. Muckerman: We can go over a mile horizontally once we're a couple miles below the surface. We're not just going straight horizontal anymore. We have directional drilling, where it's basically like a video game -- O'Reilly: Does the bit do any dances, like a shimmy-shimmy? O'Reilly: Do you think they saw the movie and thought, ""We need to do that""? Muckerman: Yeah. I mean, it's not doing spirals. It has to have some sort of straight direction to it, because they have to have the casings and cement to fortify it. But yeah, we're not just going at a 90-degree angle anymore. O'Reilly: Correct me, but, basically, when they're doing all these drills and the fracking, which we're going to touch upon in a second, a lot of what they do is to basically make sure the hole stays in place and together. Muckerman: Yeah, a lot of pipe and a lot of cement go into this process. The first thousand or so feet, I don't know, it depends on the water level, but they have to protect them first and foremost. O'Reilly: And that gets cased in cement. Muckerman: It does. They lower the piping down, and before they drill any further, they force cement down the hole, and wraps around the pipe at the bottom, and then upfills, and once it's cemented then they can use the drill bit to drill back through the hardened cement, and then they can continue drilling down to the oil and natural gas. First and foremost, they're protecting the water level. O'Reilly: So they're making a thousand-foot straw out of cement. Muckerman: The whole thing is a straw, but that's the most heavily protected part of the straw. O'Reilly: OK, and that's so things don't collapse -- Muckerman: Well, that and so we don't mess up the water table. O'Reilly: Important also. Muckerman: Yeah, so the oil and natural gas aren't seeping out into the water table through cracks in the casings. Basically, what you can imagine is, the top of this hole has the widest casing, and then they just put smaller and smaller casings down through, so it's kind of like a police baton when they snap it out. O'Reilly: Right, or an inverted skyscraper. That's actually a good analogy, the baton. Respect. So, hydraulic fracturing is the use of -- this is what I got offline -- fluid and material to create and restore small fractures and rock formations. One that hopefully has oil and natural gas in it, of course. Muckerman: Yes, you would hope. There's companies out there that help them arrive at that conclusion. O'Reilly: Right. So, historically, you find these geologic formations, and we know the types of rock that usually have reservoirs of oil. That's easy. Muckerman: Yeah, that's called conventional oil. Muckerman: Big basins, generally long-lasting wells. O'Reilly: Right. That's what Saudi Arabia has with their Ghawar Field; that's what we're talking about here. This is going down there thousands of feet, and there's oil stuck between the tiniest of rocks. It's actually crazy to think about, that we're getting it out. Muckerman: Yeah, it's thin layers that are separated by sediment and rock. So they drop a wire line into these drilled wells and send an electrical charge through this wire that then creates, like you said, a small explosion, and they do it over stages. O'Reilly: Are you saying they're fracturing the rock, Taylor? Muckerman: They are, they're fracturing the rock. Through the steel casing, and then through the rock, with pellets and things that diffuse reaction. They do it in stages. That's one reason why we're producing more oil now, because we're being able to tighten the spacing, so we can have more stages per well. They frack, they plug, they frack, they plug, they frack, they plug. Then, once they've fracked all the stages, they remove the plugs, and then they start the process of forcing the fluids and proppants down into the fractures. O'Reilly: This is like putting a man on the moon. This is really complex. Muckerman: Maybe even more complicated. Muckerman: Yeah, now you're just walking around with several of those in your pocket. O'Reilly: Yeah. We've covered a lot of ground here. What companies -- Muckerman: Yeah, there's companies in every stage of this. O'Reilly: If I have some acreage in the Delaware basin over there in West Texas, one, I'm obviously a millionaire, automatically. But do I sell the land to EOG Resources or Pioneer [Natural Resources] and call it a day? Or can I hire a company to just do the fracking for me? Muckerman: EOG and the exploration and production companies aren't necessarily buying the land. Maybe sometimes they do, but they're leasing it. Then, as an acreage holder, you get lease payments, and you probably negotiate some royalties on top of that. O'Reilly: So that's what I would do, theoretically. Muckerman: Yeah, theoretically, yeah. We're not going to talk about the producers today, because those are some of the bigger names we mention all the time, because they're the folks that are most directly impacted by the price of oil. But yeah, you're calling companies, A, you can call a company that can do pretty much everything, which is going to be a Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, or Weatherford -- those are the ExxonMobil of the drilling and fracking world. They do everything. O'Reilly: But they do not own or produce or sell the oil. Muckerman: They don't. Maybe there's some kind of way that they can negotiate a contract with royalties, but no, for the most part, you're buying a stock in these companies because they're going to do the dirty work. O'Reilly: And then they get a day rate, and that's it. Muckerman: They get a day rate for the rigs, and then for all the equipment they use, and rental prices and things like that, yeah. O'Reilly: So all along, they were giving oil companies a break on these day rates and stuff. But now, they're like, ""All right, now that oil is up, we need to ... "" Muckerman: They have to eat, too. So you get them to provide some of the equipment to do the drilling, to do the fracking, to do the completing. And then once the oil starts flowing, they throw the wellhead on it, sometimes call it a Christmas tree because that's what it looks like when it's sitting on top of the well. Then, once the oil is producing -- O'Reilly: On to the next one. Muckerman: They clean their hands with some of the orange automotive soap that really degreases everything, and then they move on to the next one. Another reason why we're producing and drilling so much more efficiently is because we have what we call pad drilling now, where they basically put some of these rigs on tracks, and without disassembling them like they used to have to do, they used to have to take apart the drilling rig every single time. O'Reilly: I'm picturing a crane. Muckerman: It's like a bulldozer or a tank. It's basically on a track. It's called pad drilling, where they can slide it over to the next well site. Disassembling these rigs was the bulk of the time these companies were spending on actual drilling. O'Reilly: You can imagine it's complex. Muckerman: Yeah, exactly. And if one bolt is wrong, you're screwed. O'Reilly: Let's talk a bit about water and sand. Muckerman: Water and sand make up about 98%-99% of what you're forcing down there, and then you have some chemical additives that are used for -- O'Reilly: Like slickwater solutions, whatever that is. Muckerman: -- to reduce the growth of bacteria, which can be dangerous, releasing gases. It also provides a bit more of a fluid environment. Yeah, predominantly water and frack sand and some sort of proppant, depending on what kind of well you're drilling. O'Reilly: There are companies like U.S. Silica and Hi-Crush Partners that literally just make the sand for these guys. Muckerman: Yeah. U.S. Silica is not just sand. I don't even know if they do just strictly sand. O'Reilly: Silica implies some kind of glass, too. Muckerman: Yeah, they can actually create a very specific proppant for a specific well. O'Reilly: Based upon the geologic properties that are downstairs. Muckerman: Yeah. And a company like Core Labs can tell you what kind of proppant might work best, because they're a core and fluid analysis company that's used by pretty much everybody in the business. O'Reilly: And you can send them a core to their lab and make them tell you stuff. Muckerman: You can send it to them; they can come get it for you. We visited them a couple years ago, and they were telling us that companies even as big as Exxon and Chevron were outsourcing their core sample analysis to Core Labs because they did it so much better than everybody else. But they've been hurt recently because their future was very heavily reliant on deepwater, so once that comes around, maybe that's another company to look at. But you analyze the core sample, and then you can determine your water to sand, water to proppant chemical ratio that's specific for each individual well. Again, technology helping us produce more oil and natural gas per individual well. O'Reilly: All this stuff, over the last five years, I assume they've been getting better at what we just described even in just the last five years and that's kind of what we're talking about with these companies lowering their cost of production even since 2012. Muckerman: But you look at these companies using much more sand -- so, not only the companies you mentioned, but CARBO Ceramics as well, and a couple smaller ones, Fairmount Santrol Holdings and Emerge Energy Services, all companies you can look at on the proppant side of the business -- as these companies use more and more proppants, demand should drive the price up, as long as they don't create too much supply too soon. O'Reilly: Right. Before we finish up here, what's the flushing stage? It's just using water to flush out the well when you're done? Muckerman: Basically, yeah. Clean up on aisle oil. But a lot of these companies now, the wells aren't being cleaned out as quickly because they're going back and using carbon dioxide to go back in and try to force more oil out. O'Reilly: And that's usually on really old wells, as I understand. Muckerman: Yeah, really old wells. They're even going back and trying to fracture conventionally drilled wells -- O'Reilly: From 100 years ago, I hear, sometimes. Muckerman: You're not getting nearly 100% of the oil and natural gas out of these wells. I would be surprised if some of these wells or even reaching 70% or 80%. O'Reilly: The conventional wells? Muckerman: Yeah. And fracking wells are leaving even more, percentage-wise, in the ground than conventional. You're going back and trying to use carbon dioxide, more water flowing through these, and refracking things in different stages after they've exhausted the conventional resource. There's a lot of activity going on -- not only those companies that we've mentioned, but National Oilwell Varco, huge equipment supplier. If you're looking at the drilling rigs, Nabors is the largest land drilling rig provider in the United States. O'Reilly: Distribution NOW gets these guys all the parts that they need when things happen. Muckerman: Helmerich & Payne is a very widely respected rig operator and rig manufacturer. Then, Patterson-UTI as well. Different stages. If you want the whole thing outside of the proppants, look at a Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, or Weatherford. If you want to get more specific, you can go proppants with the companies we mentioned -- U.S. Silica, Hi-Crush Partners, CARBO Ceramics, and those other smaller ones. Then, if you want the rig providers and operators, Helmerich & Payne, Patterson-UTI, and Nabors. They do other things, but that's the bread and butter of those three companies, the rig and drilling side of it. O'Reilly: Cool. Thanks for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman. Muckerman: Yeah, I appreciate it. It's very important, it's going on all over the United States and the world, eventually, on the same scale that we have here. O'Reilly: Watch out. Muckerman: Yeah, you can definitely not invest in the exploration and production companies and still profit from fracking. ","

                                   have been caught in a yearslong slump for oil-futures prices as demand has failed to match rising production. Prices have stalled around the $50-a-barrel mark, a price threshold where it may make sense to drill in some areas, like West Texas’ Permian Basin, but not in others. Related: In the midst of an oil-price slump, one area in Texas is enjoying a bit of a boom During calls with analysts following results, Wall Street will listen closely for clues about how Exxon and Chevron plan to calibrate growth plans against that price background. Chevron’s growth plans are generally viewed as solid, but Wall Street is bound to question its ability to execute ongoing and future projects, following delays that plagued some of its major developments. For Exxon, the focus will likely be where the company will go next. Exxon recently bought assets in the Permian Basin, where it doubled its acreage, and its deal to buy natural-gas company InterOil Corp. recently closed. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts polled by FactSet expect Exxon to report first-quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents a share, which would compare with adjusted earnings of 43 cents a share in the first quarter of 2016. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has a consensus estimate of 91 cents a share. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Chevron to report adjusted earnings of 86 cents a share, versus an adjusted loss of 22 cents a share in the year-ago period. The Estimize consensus for Chevron’s adjusted earnings is 89 cents a share. Revenue: The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Exxon to report revenue of $66.3 billion, which would compare with revenue of $48.7 billion a year ago. The forecast for Chevron is $34.9 billion, from a reported $23.6 billion in the year-ago period. Stock price: Both stocks have underperformed the broader market benchmark in 2017, and the picture is almost as dire in a 12-month span. Exxon and Chevron each have lost 9% so far this year, which compares with gains of 7% for the S&P 500 index. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -0.15% Chevron lags behind less on a 12-month basis, with the stock up 4.6% to the S&P’s 14% gain in the period. Exxon, however, has lost more than 6% in the past 12 months. Other issues: Between the two majors, analysts usually pick Chevron over Exxon, usually citing a more favorable cash flow position for Chevron. Analysts at Goldman Sachs earlier this month picked Chevron as one of their top picks among energy companies on the strength of the company’s free cash flow, dividend yield, and potential for its Permian Basin holdings. For analysts at Simmons & Co., the Street’s cash-flow estimates for both companies may be too optimistic. Cash flow delivery for both names “is at risk of disappointing,” the Simmons analysts said. “This appears particularly true for (Chevron), as full year 2017 cash flow estimates appear optimistic relative to reality,” they said. Chevron is at a free cash flow “inflection,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a separate note. “Given historical track record of execution issues investors are still skeptical of whether (Chevron) can meet consensus growth expectations, particularly in Australia,” where the company is developing massive natural-gas projects. Chevron has recently sold oil and gas fields in Bangladesh, and proceeds could be deployed in more profitable core-areas such as the Permian, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said in a recent note. For Exxon, besides updates on its recent deals, the Goldman Sachs analysts said they would look for the company’s views on longer-term growth plans, particularly in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Iraq and Russia, they said. The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week Exxon and other U.S. companies will not receive waivers to resume Russian ventures. Exxon had sought such an exemption to revive its joint venture with state-controlled PAO Rosneft, The Wall Street Journal had reported.

308,,5042017,Reuters,4272017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended flat on Thursday as a steep fall for the energy sector countered some solid earnings reports, with major stock indexes closing little changed after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a healthcare overhaul. The House on Thursday afternoon narrowly voted to repeal major portions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan, sending it to the Senate for consideration. The bill’s passage comes after House Republicans pulled healthcare legislation earlier this year in a setback, raising questions among investors about President Donald Trump’s ability to enact his agenda. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 11.7 percent since Trump’s election, fueled by his plans for tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. “The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “I don’t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue,” Meckler said. “I think they’re really focused on the tax plan. If they couldn’t pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,951.47, the S&P 500 gained 1.39 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,389.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.79 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,075.34. The energy sector dropped 1.9 percent, easily the worst performing group. Exxon Mobil’s 1.3-percent decline and Chevron’s 1.8-percent drop weighed on the S&P. Oil prices tumbled about 5 percent on signs that OPEC and other producing countries would not take more drastic steps to reduce the world’s stubbornly persistent glut of crude. Investors also were digesting the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday. The central bank left rates unchanged but downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth while emphasizing the strong labor market, in a sign it was still on track for two more rate rises this year. Focus was turning to Friday’s U.S. employment report as the next gauge of the economy and labor market. Data on Thursday showed new applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell sharply last week and the number of Americans on unemployment rolls hit a 17-year low. “It’s going to be particularly important to see if we get the expected rebound in job gains,” given that the Fed discounted the first quarter growth weakness because of a projected recovery, said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. “Now the market is going to be watching very carefully to see whether or not they get that confirming data that would mean we will get a June rate increase,” Gayle said. In corporate news, Tesla fell 5 percent after the electric automaker’s quarterly net loss widened. In the healthcare sector, Regeneron rose 6.7 percent and Zoetis rose 5.9 percent after their respective results. Earnings season has come in generally above expectations, encouraging investors. First-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have increased 14.8 percent, the strongest since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 77 new lows. About 7.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. ","

Greenwashing is an advertising and public relations spin designed to make a corporation look more environmentally friendly than it actually is. The practice has become so popular that the term even made it into the tenth edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. Corporate greenwashing is an issue that everyone should be mindful of. No one wants to be lied to, and lies that affect the environment – and possibly human health and survival – are particularly heinous. In a world where going green means big money to corporations, it's not surprising that some cut corners. In this article we'll explore why corporations greenwash their activities, provide some prime examples of greenwashing and show you what you can do to ensure that you are not the latest greenwashing casualty. Asking a corporation to go green solely on the basis of ethics is a bit like asking a shark to stop eating because the other fish are getting upset. It is simply unequipped to make a moral choice. Sharks eat fish; corporations make money – it's what they do. Increasing sales of their goods and services, cutting costs and increasing efficiency all play a role in making a company – and its shareholders – more cash. The interests of the shareholders always come first – always. Corporations, and by extension corporate executives, are legally bound to make as much money for their shareholders as possible. This isn't a bad thing. It's a system of rules that guarantees that when you invest your money into a company, you can be confident that the people running it will do their best to ensure you see a return on your investment. This is where another concept of the corporate world comes into play: cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis tells corporate executives that sometimes it's cheaper (and therefore better) to say you are going green, than to actually go green. Overall, people like green companies. Being perceived as a friend of the environment can mean big money in a world where perception is reality. If lying has the same result as telling the truth, and costs less money, corporate executives are duty bound to do a little greenwashing. (To read about how going green benefits companies, read For Companies, Green Is The New Black.) If you go to any corporation's website you are bound to find a ""corporate responsibility statement"" or ""sustainability policy."" These statements reassure us that the company really does care about the environment and social issues. Often the worst offenders have the best spin, admitting past discretions and, like a reformed criminal, promising to do better this time – be honest. Let's have a look at some greenwashing all-stars: What it says: In July 2000, BP launched a massive $200 million public relations and advertising campaign with the new slogan ""Beyond Petroleum."" It changed its logo to a green and yellow sun, and started spouting green-tinged comments. What it does: In March 2006, BP spilled 200,000 gallons of crude oil in Alaska. The spill happened because BP failed to perform routine maintenance on its pipeline. In October 2007, BP was ordered to pay more than $60 million by the U.S. Department of Justice for breaking environmental laws in Texas and Alaska. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, this was the largest fine ever handed out for breaking Clean Air regulations. In addition, BP has lobbied continuously to open up the Alaska National Wilderness Reserve for oil drilling and to block legislation to introduce a mandatory curb on greenhouse gases in the U.S. What it says: ""We are guided by our core values: Safety and Health; Environmental Stewardship; Respect for People; Ethical Behavior. DuPont has a 204-year legacy of core values, rooted strongly in safety, health and environmental stewardship. For almost 20 years, we have been reducing the environmental footprint of our own operations,"" (DuPont website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: DuPont is the largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The company continued producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) throughout the 1980s even though research in the ‘70s showed these chemicals contributed to ozone layer depletion. In January 2005, DuPont reported a study on the chemical PFOA (a chemical used in Teflon and other nonstick products), saying there were no known human health effects associated with exposure to PFOA. However, it was reported in the Charleston Gazette (""DuPont Distorted C8 Study, Scientists,"" October 2007) that DuPont distorted the findings and the study actually said there were several harmful health effects associated with this chemical, including low birth weight rates and elevated cholesterol. What it says: GE launched a $90 million ""Ecomagination"" marketing campaign in 2005. As part of the campaign, GE produced ads with a diesel train engine slipping through pristine mountains surrounded by flowers, birds and trees. What it does: In a piece of impressive hypocrisy, while it ran the ""enviro-choo choo"" ads, the company was simultaneously lobbying the EPA to weaken proposed nitrogen oxide restrictions for diesel engines. A reduction in smog from trains and ships could provide more than $70 billion in health and environmental benefits within 20 years, according to the EPA, meanwhile, the cost of compliance would be only $2-$3 billion. What it says: ""Recognizing the potential risks associated with climate change, we are taking actions to improve efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are also working with the scientific and business communities to undertake research to identify and develop economically competitive and affordable technologies to reduce long-term global greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the world's growing demand for energy"" (Exxon Mobil website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: The oil company funded 43 climate change denial groups in 2004 alone, according to a study by the U.S. Union of Concerned Scientists. Their report states that, between 1990 and 2005, the company funneled more than $16 million to advocacy groups that promote the denial of global warming through publications and websites that are not peer reviewed by the scientific community. (To read more about energy disputes, see The Biofuels Debate and Peak Oil: What To Do When The Wells Run Dry.) What it says: ""We apply innovation and technology to help farmers around the world be successful, produce healthier foods, better animal feeds and more fiber, while also reducing agriculture's impact on our environment"" (Monsanto website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: In June 2007, Monsanto acquired Delta & Pine Land Company, a company that creates ""terminator"" seeds. These seeds grow into plants that produce sterile seed. This means farmers can't replant seeds from a previous crop, making them dependent on the company year after year. In the 1930s Monsanto bought the company that invented PCBs, a now-banned industrial coolant, and became the source of nearly all PCBs in the U.S. In a January 2002 Washington Post article (""Monsato Hid Decades Of Pollution""), it was revealed that Monsanto hid 40 years worth of PCB pollution in Anniston, Alabama. It's alleged the company dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into open-pit landfills and routinely discharged toxic waste into a nearby creek. If you suspect that the latest green convert isn't as pious as it claims to be, your first stop should be the internet. The backlash against greenwashing is growing, and information is getting easier to find. The following nonprofit websites are dedicated to telling the other side of the story: These sites allow readers to cut through much of the spin a company produces. The information on these sites is referenced and sourced. Note: Much of the environmental record research for this article began at these sites. Not every company that touts its green achievements is lying, but it's important to remember that advertising and marketing campaigns are designed to highlight the good and ignore the bad. Sometimes it's cheaper to say you're a friend of the forest than to stop chopping down trees. A healthy dose of skepticism is the key. Green marketing should only be swallowed with a grain of salt. Remember, if the tree-hugger beard looks too good to be true, it probably is. ",The Green Marketing Machine,0.994

For almost 20 years, we have been reducing the environmental footprint of our own operations,"" (DuPont website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: DuPont is the largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The company continued producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) throughout the 1980s even though research in the ‘70s showed these chemicals contributed to ozone layer depletion. In January 2005, DuPont reported a study on the chemical PFOA (a chemical used in Teflon and other nonstick products), saying there were no known human health effects associated with exposure to PFOA. However, it was reported in the Charleston Gazette (""DuPont Distorted C8 Study, Scientists,"" October 2007) that DuPont distorted the findings and the study actually said there were several harmful health effects associated with this chemical, including low birth weight rates and elevated cholesterol. What it says: GE launched a $90 million ""Ecomagination"" marketing campaign in 2005. As part of the campaign, GE produced ads with a diesel train engine slipping through pristine mountains surrounded by flowers, birds and trees. What it does: In a piece of impressive hypocrisy, while it ran the ""enviro-choo choo"" ads, the company was simultaneously lobbying the EPA to weaken proposed nitrogen oxide restrictions for diesel engines. A reduction in smog from trains and ships could provide more than $70 billion in health and environmental benefits within 20 years, according to the EPA, meanwhile, the cost of compliance would be only $2-$3 billion. What it says: ""Recognizing the potential risks associated with climate change, we are taking actions to improve efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are also working with the scientific and business communities to undertake research to identify and develop economically competitive and affordable technologies to reduce long-term global greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the world's growing demand for energy"" (Exxon Mobil website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: The oil company funded 43 climate change denial groups in 2004 alone, according to a study by the U.S. Union of Concerned Scientists. Their report states that, between 1990 and 2005, the company funneled more than $16 million to advocacy groups that promote the denial of global warming through publications and websites that are not peer reviewed by the scientific community. (To read more about energy disputes, see The Biofuels Debate and Peak Oil: What To Do When The Wells Run Dry.) What it says: ""We apply innovation and technology to help farmers around the world be successful, produce healthier foods, better animal feeds and more fiber, while also reducing agriculture's impact on our environment"" (Monsanto website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: In June 2007, Monsanto acquired Delta & Pine Land Company, a company that creates ""terminator"" seeds. These seeds grow into plants that produce sterile seed. This means farmers can't replant seeds from a previous crop, making them dependent on the company year after year. In the 1930s Monsanto bought the company that invented PCBs, a now-banned industrial coolant, and became the source of nearly all PCBs in the U.S. In a January 2002 Washington Post article (""Monsato Hid Decades Of Pollution""), it was revealed that Monsanto hid 40 years worth of PCB pollution in Anniston, Alabama. It's alleged the company dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into open-pit landfills and routinely discharged toxic waste into a nearby creek. If you suspect that the latest green convert isn't as pious as it claims to be, your first stop should be the internet. The backlash against greenwashing is growing, and information is getting easier to find. The following nonprofit websites are dedicated to telling the other side of the story: These sites allow readers to cut through much of the spin a company produces. The information on these sites is referenced and sourced. Note: Much of the environmental record research for this article began at these sites. Not every company that touts its green achievements is lying, but it's important to remember that advertising and marketing campaigns are designed to highlight the good and ignore the bad. Sometimes it's cheaper to say you're a friend of the forest than to stop chopping down trees. A healthy dose of skepticism is the key. Green marketing should only be swallowed with a grain of salt.

311,Tom DiChristopher,5042017,CNBC,4272017,"Exxon Mobil beat Wall Street's expectations as first quarter earnings more than doubled profits in the year ago period on rising oil prices and cost cutting. Shares were up 1.6 percent following the release. The world's most valuable publicly traded energy company posted profits of $4 billion, or 95 cents per share, for the quarter, compared with analysts' EPS estimates for 85 cents. The Irving, Texas-based oil giant earned $1.8 billion, or 43 cents a share in the year ago period. ""Our results reflect an increase in commodity prices and highlight our continued focus on controlling costs and operating efficiently,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. The integrated energy company brought in $63.3 billion in revenues, missing expectations for $64.7 billion. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry —were $8.2 billion, significantly better than $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, costs fell as Exxon reduced its capital and exploration spending by $4.2 billion, down 19 percent over the past year. Earnings in Exxon's upstream exploration and production segment improved to $2.3 billion as the company fetched a higher price for its products. Downstream fuel refining and marketing operations earned $1.1 billion, a slight jump from the year-ago period. Higher profit margins among other factors underscored the improvement. Profits in Exxon's chemicals business fell by $184 million from last year to $1.2 billion, hurt by weaker profit margins and foreign exchange factors. Exxon announced significant investments in its U.S. drilling and refining operations in the first quarter. In January, it doubled its oil and gas holdings in the southern Permian Basin with a $5.6 billion purchase. Last month, it said it would invest $20 billion in its Gulf Coast chemical and oil refining facilities over the next five years. The quarter also saw Exxon reduce its overall oil reserves by 3.3 billion barrels, as persistently low oil prices forced the company to take off its books 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen reserves at its Alberta, Canada oil sands project. This came after Exxon took a $2 billion impairment in the previous quarter related to a downward revision of its U.S. reserves. On Wednesday, Exxon announced a 77 cents quarterly dividend, a two cents increase from last quarter. ",Exxon Mobil beats earnings expectations as profits double,0.9845
312,Bob Pisani,5042017,CNBC,4272017,"My colleague Juan Aruego, who has been tracking earnings at CNBC for many years, this morning called my attention to a little-noticed item on Apple's earnings call: the company's share count fell 66.3 million shares during the quarter. At Tuesday's closing price, Juan told me, that is a $9.8 billion drop in market cap. It's a very important point. Apple is part of an elite group I call ""buyback monsters,"" companies that have been aggressively buying back stock for years. Apple's shares outstanding topped out in 2013 at roughly 6.6 billion shares. Since then it has been down every year and now stands at 5.2 billion. That is a reduction of 21 percent in shares outstanding since 2013. What's that mean? It means all other things being equal, the company's earnings per share are 21 percent higher than they would have been had it not done the buybacks. But that's only since 2013 ... there are companies that have been doing this much longer. IBM's shares outstanding topped out at 2.3 billion way back in 1995, it's been going down almost every year since then, and now stands at 939 million shares. Think about that. That's a 60 percent reduction in shares outstanding in a little more than 20 years. Same with Exxon Mobil. After the Mobil acquisition in 1999, shares outstanding topped out at just shy of 7 billion in 2000 and have been going almost steadily downhill since. There's now 4.2 billion shares outstanding, a reduction of 40 percent since 2000. Other big names have gotten more aggressive only recently. General Electric, for example, dramatically cut its shares outstanding from 10.0 billion shares to 8.7 billion in 2016, a 13 percent reduction. McDonald's has reduced its share count by 39 percent since 2000. Pfizer has lowered its share count by 25 percent since 2010. I could go on, but you get the point. Is there anything wrong with this? No, but it does lead to charges that companies are spending more money on ""financial engineering"" than on capital spending. It certainly does indicate that companies are at a loss on how to improve their top line, which is what will ultimately improve the bottom line. It leads to frequent complaints by analysts about the ""quality"" of earnings. One final point: while all this ""financial engineering"" helps boost earnings and stock prices, it also serves to reduce the weight in the various indexes, particularly the S&P 500. In an era where indexing rules, it means Exxon Mobil and IBM are not nearly as influential as they used to be. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Tariff concerns remain a key talking point on Wall Street when dissecting the market volatility fit over the past month, but the issue seems to be carrying less heft among corporate executives.

313,Catherine Clifford,5042017,CNBC,4272017,"As the school year comes to a close, internship season is kicking off for many students. But not all interns make coffee runs for no pay. In particular, in finance and tech, college interns are paid very well with lots of perks. Facebook summer interns, for example, earn almost twice what the average American worker makes — $8,000 per month working at Mark Zuckerberg's social media behemoth, according to a new report from jobs website  Glassdoor. Annualized, that's $96,000. The average U.S. worker makes $51,350,  according to March 2017 data, also from Glassdoor. Here's a look at the 25 highest-paid internships in America and what it's like being a summer intern at these companies. Observations are pulled from anonymously submitted feedback on Glassdoor. 1. FacebookMedian monthly pay: $8,000The good: ""Amazing perks (free food, snacks, transportation, housing -- own bedroom and bathroom!), as well as completely paid-for intern events on the weekends.""The bad: ""Difficult to switch teams and try other options as an intern. ...

314,"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com",5042017,CNBC,4272017,"With Apple set to report second-quarter profits Tuesday, it's only a little bit of an exaggeration to say all of Wall Street's about to get a little bit of a raise. That's because the spring is when Apple typically announces its annual dividend hike. After a 24 percent jump in Apple shares this year, their yield is just about 1.6 percent, well below its peak and even below the yield of the Standard & Poor's 500 and its corresponding ETFs like IVV and SPY which yield roughly 1.9 percent. And that matters, even to people who don't directly own Apple shares, because the world's most-valuable company —that is sitting on a stockpile of cash that has topped $250 billion — is a core holding of both index mutual funds and the inexpensive exchange-traded funds held by more than 5 million U.S. households, according to the Investment Company Institute. ""This is normally the quarter when they talk about (dividends and stock buybacks) and we expect it to be the focus,'' said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. ""No one will really care about the iPhone results ahead of a massive launch of the iPhone 8 [in September]."" Everybody has a stake in Apple this year in particular, since the stock's recent run to as high as $145 from about $92 last June has been driving indexes and index funds. One measure of Apple's recent importance: It accounts for almost 30 percent of the gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since it hit 20,000.The next-most important stock in the 6 percent-plus rise for Dow ETFs this year — DIA and IYY — has been airplane giant Boeing. In the world of ETFs, Apple shares loom large. Apple is roughly 15 percent of the S&P 500 Technology Index ETF (XLK) and 17 percent of the $3.3 billion iShares U.S. Technology Fund (IYW). Apple is 3.66 percent of the S&P 500 ETF, according to Morningstar. The dividend announcement is likely to accompany an expansion of Apple's stock buybacks, perhaps by as much as $45 billion to $50 billion, according to an estimate done by Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski. Its not a shareholder reward program Apple tends to divulge details on until later in the year, but CFRA analyst Zino suggested that may change if details President Trump's plans to allow low-tax repatriation of offshore corporate cash holdings become clear — it was not presented with any detail in the tax reform overview provided by the White House last week. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company has allocated several billion dollars of its offshore holdings for buybacks as soon as the company can move the money into the U.S. without paying U.S. corporate taxes on it. Most market watchers, noting that as much as three-fourths of cash repatriated during a tax holiday on foreign profits while George W. Bush was president — even though it was technically prohibited by Congress — expect Apple to pay out much more. ""They could reduce the share count another 20 percent if they get the repatriation effect,"" Zino said. More from ETF Strategist:The death of active management in one article
Tesla's ETF problem
Playing Elon Musk's energy agenda through ETFs The company has been returning capital to holders of shares since 2012, when it instituted a buyback and dividend in response to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn. Apple's initial dividend was the largest ""dividend increase"" in the S&P 500 ever, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. About 94 percent of its $246 million in cash and securities is held overseas, as the company uses most domestic profits for reinvestment and return to shareholders, supplemented by money the company has borrowed for buybacks. Apple raised its quarterly dividend, currently 57 cents, by a nickel each of the past two years, while buybacks have reduced Apple's shares outstanding by almost 20 percent, worth about $150 billion at today's share price. The amount Apple spends on dividends, about $12 billion last fiscal year, has been nearly unchanged because the higher payout is offset by the shrinking number of shares, Zino said. The company's yield since 2012 has fluctuated between about its current level and about 2.4 percent, fluctuating with Apple's stock price. In February, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani suggested the company could afford to boost its payout to 4 percent, though Zino considers such a sharp move unlikely, and Apple has played it safe with dividend raises in recent history rather than meet more aggressive wishes from Wall Street and investors. Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com, said investors interested in Apple as a dividend play still have to come back to an obvious fact: ""The way to play Apple (or any other company) isn't with an ETF, it's with the stock,"" Nadig said. ""Of course, if you are trying to participate in the broad market you want some exposure to Apple. That's the beauty of a cap-weighted index. If you own a total market ETF your exposure to Apple is exactly as important as the entire stock market has decided it is."" Another modest boost wouldn't goose shares of Apple, or the funds that hold its stock, much higher in the near term. But a higher payout would buttress the foundation for longer-term returns for Apple's owners. Dividend stocks have always been safe havens in a volatile market, but they're tanking in 2018.

315,Reuben Gregg Brewer,5042017,Fool,4272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Despite a lingering oil sector downturn, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remained an industry leader. For example, unlike many peers, it's been profitable throughout this difficult period and it's continued to increase its dividend annually  for 34 years and counting. While investors can take solace in the oil and gas giant's business performance, that doesn't mean the very real issues clouding the company's outlook can be ignored. Here are three challenges facing ExxonMobil Corporation today. Low oil prices have an impact throughout Exxon's business. On the one hand, cheap oil actually helps the company's refining and chemicals operations because it means a key feedstock is, well, cheap. That, in turn, helps these businesses widen margins and make more money. This highlights a key advantage of Exxon's integrated business model. But if prices go up, margins will get squeezed. Image source: ExxonMobil Corporation And then there's oil drilling, which is the largest part of the business. In the second quarter of 2014, before oil prices started a precipitous plunge from over $100 a barrel to a low around $30, Exxon's upstream segment had earnings of nearly $7.9 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2016, after prices had recovered from their lows to the $50 range, upstream earned roughly $1.4 billion. That figure is after taking out the impact of an asset impairment charge that pushed it nearly $650 million into the red. The benefit of low oil prices can offset only a portion of the pain when it's on that scale. In other words, oil will continue to drive results up and down, and there's little Exxon can do about that. That said, the company has used the downturn to invest in new assets that should help enhance its flexibility in a low-oil-price world (more on the pros and cons of that below). . Oil prices have a direct impact on the second big issue facing Exxon: maintaining reserves. From a big-picture point of view, oil companies have a set amount of oil and natural gas in the ground. Every barrel they pull up is one less barrel available for the future. Which is why oil companies are always on the lookout for new sources of oil. In 2016 Exxon replaced only about two-thirds of the oil it produced. That was the first time in more than two decades that it didn't replenish its reserves with at least the amount it drilled. Replacement numbers go up and down, so one year isn't enough to indicate a problem...yet. The issue is that low oil prices make it harder to find profitable oil to replace what's pulled up, let alone enough to actually grow reserves. When oil is over $100 a barrel, companies can drill almost anywhere profitably (that's hyperbole, but you get the idea). When oil is at $30 a barrel, it's awfully hard to justify spending much money on anything. That said, Exxon recently announced a large oil discovery in offshore Guyana. It's also expanded its footprint in the U.S. onshore space via an acquisition that roughly doubled its Permian basin holdings. Both should help support its reserves over time. And Exxon has plans to up its capital spending over the next few years, too. Still, keep an eye on reserves: If the situation doesn't improve Exxon will have a major long-term problem. The Permian acquisition is notable because it indicates a shift in the company's thinking. Historically, Exxon has focused on large and expensive projects that took years to complete. That's pretty much the specialty of big integrated oil companies. Although Exxon is hardly abandoning such projects, low oil prices make it harder to justify those investments. Exxon is shifting away from giant oil projects over the near term. Image source: ExxonMobil What the Permian purchase suggests is that the oil giant is looking to increase its flexibility by increasing its exposure to onshore U.S. drilling, which is easier to ramp up and down as oil prices change. That surely adds flexibility, but it's a different approach than Exxon has taken in the past and it could limit the company's ability to provide investors with industry leading investment returns. The U.S. onshore space simply doesn't offer the same returns as large projects. The increased focus on so-called ""short cycle"" projects (U.S. onshore) is coupled with continued investment in Exxon's downstream chemicals and refining businesses. The downstream business tends to have thinner margins than the upstream segment. In the end, more than half of Exxon's capital spending between now and 2020 is projected to support investments that don't provide the same return as big projects. That's potential headwind to Exxon living up to its past successes. On the plus side, all of this should help to diversify Exxon's business. And that should make returns more stable over time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are looking for a stable dividend paying business. Although Exxon just went through a leadership change, the company is pretty insular and changes relatively slowly. That's not a bad thing in this case, since Exxon has long been an industry leader. I believe strongly that it will survive this downturn and prosper again -- otherwise I wouldn't own it. However, my confidence doesn't alter the fact that the company has to deal with low oil prices and their impact on earnings. Or the impact that cheap oil has on finding profitable new oil resources. And then there's the company's increasing focus on businesses that don't offer the same bang for the buck as the giant oil projects for which Exxon is known. There are clearly risks here. That said, all of this bad news could be a good opportunity for long-term investors since the yield is toward the high end of its historical range. But you have to believe Exxon can survive the notable challenges it's facing today, and thrive in the future if you are going to pull the trigger here. ","
      
    3 Biggest Challenges Facing Dividend Giant ExxonMobil Corporation -- The Motley Fool

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is one of the America's oldest stock indexes, and it's easily the country's most iconic. It's comprised of 30 huge multinational corporations, all of which have demonstrated a penchant for creating shareholder value over the long run. Image source: Getty Images. For example, conglomerate General Electric is the sixth-largest company represented in the Dow, with a market cap of roughly $260 billion. But its share price is less than $30. Based on the current Dow divisor, which translates the share prices of Dow components into the point value that we follow as investors, GE's share price contributes just 202 of the Dow's 20,548 points, the closing value as of Friday, April 21. That's not even a full 1%. Yet, a company we'll be discussing in a moment that has just 30% of the market cap of GE also has seven times its influence in the Dow, all because of share price. In fact, through Friday, the Dow would be 308 points higher if the following three companies were merely flat for the year instead of down between 9% and 11%. Though it doesn't happen often, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed Wall Street's expectations by a wide margin in the first quarter, and that's the primary reason it's shaved nearly 155 points off the Dow year to date. It's also the aforementioned company that has seven times as much influence on the Dow as GE based solely on its share price. Image source: Getty Images. For the first quarter, Goldman wound up reporting $5.15 per share in EPS on $8.03 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Wall Street was looking for $420 million more in revenue and $0.16 more in earnings per share. Goldman attributed its subpar results to weakness in certain market segments. For instance, even though investment banking revenue scorched higher by 16% year over year, revenue from fixed income was flat, while equity revenue dipped 6% on account of weaker volumes in the United States. The low interest rate environment continues to hold back Goldman Sachs, which is listed as a bank in name, but is really an investment institution by practice. The good news is that at least the Federal Reserve is in the midst of tightening monetary policy, albeit slowly. As rates rise, investor demand for fixed-income assets will likely improve as well. This should reduce market volatility and give the king of bonds, Goldman Sachs, some healthy profits. But it's going to take time before the bond market is a boon once again for Goldman Sachs. In the interim, it's been quite the drag on the Dow in 2017. Integrated oil and gas companies have regularly taken it on the chin over the past three years. Surprisingly, though, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has held up better than many of its peers. Its geographic diversity and ability to cut costs probably played a key role in its ability to withstand sinking crude oil prices. Image source: Getty Images. However, in 2017 Chevron has been notably weaker. On a pure percentage basis, Chevron is the worst-performing stock in the Dow year to date, and it's removed almost 88 Dow points. The failure of crude prices to move higher is one reason Chevron is struggling. Despite cuts from OPEC that were expected to reduce supply and help buoy crude prices, U.S. crude and gasoline inventories hit an all-time record high in mid-February. This picture paints the need for more production cuts in the future, and more importantly, shows there is no quick fix for crude oil prices. The other issue for Chevron is that its fourth-quarter earnings results, released earlier this year, weren't very encouraging. Despite the company's $415 million in net income during Q4 2016, there were a handful of disappointments. For instance, Chevron's operating cash flow is still not high enough to cover the costs of paying out its dividend. Chevron has admittedly worked hard to become a Dividend Aristocrat (i.e., a company that's increased its payout for 25 or more consecutive years) and likely doesn't want to give up that title, but it's being forced to issue debt to cover a portion of its payouts at the moment. Additionally, the company's U.S. downstream operations produced no earnings as a result of a 21% decline in per-day output, which Chevron blamed on planned turnaround activity at its refinery in Richmond, California. The good news for investors is that Chevron still has plenty of cost-cutting channels left, as well as numerous projects that are poised to boost production over the long term. However, an ongoing crude supply glut is a problem that isn't likely to be resolved anytime soon. Finally, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is in much the same boat as Chevron. Its stock has held up far better than many of its peers, but rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories clearly have investors concerned. This year hasn't been so kind to big oil stocks, with ExxonMobil removing more than 65 points from the Dow in 2017. Image source: Pixabay. Though ExxonMobil's fourth-quarter report was a bit more upbeat than Chevron's -- after all, it was able to cover its dividend payouts with cash flow generated from operations and asset sales -- it still came with some clear downsides. For instance, ExxonMobil wound up taking an impairment charge of about $2 billion in its U.S. upstream segment that was tied to undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains. The company also saw its full-year 2016 earnings hit by weaker refining margins, although this was a sectorwide issue last year. And, for those shareholders who've become accustomed to ExxonMobil being exceptionally generous with share buybacks, there's been a notable decline in the number of shares it's repurchasing. Like Chevron, ExxonMobil has the ability to reduce its expenditures to account for weakened demand or modestly lower commodity prices. Its Q4 2016 capital expenditures were down 35% from the prior-year quarter, to $4.8 billion. These are the types of steep cuts that may be needed if ExxonMobil wants to keep its healthy dividend firmly in place. ExxonMobil has ample projects underway to boost production in the years to come, but without oil industry dynamics favoring the company, it could be tough sledding in 2017. ","

Nigerian labor unions have criticized oil companies for sacking workers in the last few months and held a number of strikes. Abel Agarin, who chairs the Lagos zone of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), said members of his union were on strike in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December. He said 82 were PENGASSAN members. “We want them to be brought back and if that is not possible we want a proper severance package for them,” said Agarin, who led around 50 protesters in the commercial capital. PENGASSAN said strikes were being held in Lagos, Bonny, Akwa Ibom and Port Harcourt. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said by email that there were “no impacts” on oil production. Two oil traders said it was too early to say whether the strikes would have an impact on production. Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of 2016 did impact output, leading to weeks-long loading delays. ","

It sure is, but with these data points it makes sense for stocks to be pricey: This is a rare confluence of events — lower risk right across the board. It's not surprising that world markets are at new highs: Global stock marketsU.S.: historic highGermany: historic highFrance: multiyear highJapan: 16-month highEmerging markets (EEM): 23-month high Is the U.S. market expensive? Sure, by historic standards. Stocks have a very good correlation with forward earnings estimates. According to FactSet, the forward P/E estimate for the S&P 500 — which includes the last eight months of this year and the first four months of 2018 — is 17.5 (2,396/$137.04 = 17.5). The 20-year average is 16.0, so the current estimate is above average, but not dramatically so. It's also not surprising that with these kinds of data points we are getting markets at new highs, but traders are whining about the low volume and low volatility. Again, this is not shocking: prices are too high to make buyers enthusiastic, but sellers are not enthusiastic either because everyone believes that a modest drop in the market will only be met with more buying. Finally, for everyone who keeps asking me why I am spending so much time on European earnings and the economic state of Europe, it's pretty simple: many people own Europe through ETFs now, and U.S.-based companies get a significant portion of their revenues from Europe. By ""significant,"" I mean roughly 15 percent or above: The lesson here: Europe matters for U.S. investors! The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Tariff concerns remain a key talking point on Wall Street when dissecting the market volatility fit over the past month, but the issue seems to be carrying less heft among corporate executives.

Despite a lingering oil sector downturn, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remained an industry leader. For example, unlike many peers, it's been profitable throughout this difficult period and it's continued to increase its dividend annually  for 34 years and counting. While investors can take solace in the oil and gas giant's business performance, that doesn't mean the very real issues clouding the company's outlook can be ignored. Here are three challenges facing ExxonMobil Corporation today. Low oil prices have an impact throughout Exxon's business. On the one hand, cheap oil actually helps the company's refining and chemicals operations because it means a key feedstock is, well, cheap. That, in turn, helps these businesses widen margins and make more money. This highlights a key advantage of Exxon's integrated business model. But if prices go up, margins will get squeezed. Image source: ExxonMobil Corporation And then there's oil drilling, which is the largest part of the business. In the second quarter of 2014, before oil prices started a precipitous plunge from over $100 a barrel to a low around $30, Exxon's upstream segment had earnings of nearly $7.9 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2016, after prices had recovered from their lows to the $50 range, upstream earned roughly $1.4 billion. That figure is after taking out the impact of an asset impairment charge that pushed it nearly $650 million into the red. The benefit of low oil prices can offset only a portion of the pain when it's on that scale. In other words, oil will continue to drive results up and down, and there's little Exxon can do about that. That said, the company has used the downturn to invest in new assets that should help enhance its flexibility in a low-oil-price world (more on the pros and cons of that below). . Oil prices have a direct impact on the second big issue facing Exxon: maintaining reserves. From a big-picture point of view, oil companies have a set amount of oil and natural gas in the ground. Every barrel they pull up is one less barrel available for the future. Which is why oil companies are always on the lookout for new sources of oil. In 2016 Exxon replaced only about two-thirds of the oil it produced. That was the first time in more than two decades that it didn't replenish its reserves with at least the amount it drilled. Replacement numbers go up and down, so one year isn't enough to indicate a problem...yet. The issue is that low oil prices make it harder to find profitable oil to replace what's pulled up, let alone enough to actually grow reserves. When oil is over $100 a barrel, companies can drill almost anywhere profitably (that's hyperbole, but you get the idea). When oil is at $30 a barrel, it's awfully hard to justify spending much money on anything. That said, Exxon recently announced a large oil discovery in offshore Guyana. It's also expanded its footprint in the U.S. onshore space via an acquisition that roughly doubled its Permian basin holdings. Both should help support its reserves over time. And Exxon has plans to up its capital spending over the next few years, too. Still, keep an eye on reserves: If the situation doesn't improve Exxon will have a major long-term problem. The Permian acquisition is notable because it indicates a shift in the company's thinking. Historically, Exxon has focused on large and expensive projects that took years to complete. That's pretty much the specialty of big integrated oil companies. Although Exxon is hardly abandoning such projects, low oil prices make it harder to justify those investments.

322,,5182017,Reuters,5112017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp announced it will bring its Mobil-brand gas stations to Mexico, pumping $300 million in the coming decade as it seeks to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. Exxon expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will offer motorists its Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels, the U.S.-based oil company said in a statement on Wednesday. The company did not specify how many service stations it would open in Mexico or where it would source the fuel for them. But local newspaper Reforma reported on Wednesday that Exxon company official Martin Proske said in an interview that supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from state-owned Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. BP told Reuters on Wednesday that its foray into Mexico is proving more promising than expected, and that it would likely increase its investment in everything from exploration to retail fuel sales. Separately, Mexican media reported Royal Dutch Shell said it would also open its first gas station in the country this year, citing the firm’s downstream chief for Mexico, Andres Cavallari. Shell did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Latin America’s No. 2 economy is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed - by law - to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. “Recent energy reforms present a unique opportunity to help meet the growing demand for reliable fuel supplies and quality service in Mexico,” Exxon’s Proske said in a company statement. Fears had grown in Mexico that foreign investment might fall after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected last year, as he railed against companies that moved operations to Mexico. U.S.-Mexico relations have also been strained by Trump’s threat to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement and his promise to build a wall between the two countries. But Exxon’s announcement was the latest good news for Mexico’s economy after General Electric Co last week praised the country as vital to its growth and Siemens later said that it was going to swap out U.S. imports for local supplies at its Mexican plants. However, growing fuel theft has worried some in the energy sector. Mexican authorities have been struggling to contain criminal gangs siphoning off fuel that Pemex has said is costing it some 27,000 barrels per day in gasoline and diesel. ","

323,Javier C. Hernández,5182017,CNBC,5112017,"The real estate company owned by the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, said on Friday that its employees would no longer take part in a cross-country roadshow in China this month. Executives from Kushner Companies, including Nicole Meyer, Mr. Kushner's sister, were expected to appear in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou and the central city of Wuhan this month, according to ads for the events. But after an uproar, the company and its Chinese partner said on Friday that Kushner Companies would no longer be present at those events, although it will continue to actively court investors. More from New York Times: Fiat Chrysler Recalls a Million Ram Pickups Over a Fatal Flaw Judge Denies Uber's Motion for Private ArbitrationBombardier Scion Resigns as Executive Chairman Under Pressure From Investors The company is seeking $150 million in financing for a New Jersey housing development through a program that gives foreigners who invest at least $500,000 a shot at green cards, which allow permanent residence in the United States. The overall sum represents about 15 percent of the total cost of the property project. But the effort to raise money in China  drew widespread criticism, with ethics experts saying it presented a conflict of interest. Mr. Kushner  continues to benefit from a stake in his family's real estate business and other investments worth as much as $600 million. On Friday, Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said its employees would no longer participate in the roadshow after taking part in meetings in Beijing and Shanghai last weekend. ""No one from Kushner Companies will be in China this weekend,"" she said in a statement, which was  earlier reported by The Washington Post. The Chinese partner of Kushner Companies, an immigration agency named Qiaowai, said on Friday that the meetings this month would go forward, but that no one from Kushner Companies would attend. Qiaowai had marketed the Kushner family's visit as a five-city tour over two weeks, ending in Wuhan. The Chinese firm will still give presentations on the New Jersey project, field questions on the investor visa program and solicit investments. Ms. Meyer added a star turn to efforts by Kushner Companies to raise money in China. Mr. Kushner is married to Mr. Trump's elder daughter, Ivanka. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, fascination with his family has grown in China, especially as Mr. Kushner has become a power broker in relations between Washington and Beijing. Speaking at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing on Saturday, Ms. Meyer said the New Jersey project, called One Journal Square, ""means a lot to me and my entire family."" She said Mr. Kushner, who resigned as chief executive of the company in January, was now serving in the White House. Ms. Meyer's remarks drew intense backlash in the United States, with critics seizing on the roadshow as a stark example of  the conflicts of interest in Mr. Trump's White House. The company later apologized, saying Ms. Meyer did not intend to use her brother's name to lure investors. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Kushner was in compliance with ethics rules and had ""nothing to do"" with the company's work in China. Adding to the fallout, the mayor of Jersey City, N.J., where One Journal Square is set to be built, said on Sunday that  he opposed the Kushner family's request for hefty tax breaks for the project. The roadshow also raised questions about the investor visa program known as EB-5, which has been plagued by fraud and abuse scandals and is likely to be overhauled this year. Even in China, where business and politics often mix, there was a hint of indignation. State-run news media published reports asking whether the company was benefiting from unfair competition. ""Caution urged on Kushner project,"" read a headline in the Global Times newspaper. But Hao Junbo, a lawyer in Beijing, said Ms. Meyer's emphasis on family connections would probably prove to be a winning message in China. ""Chinese people have a tradition of worshiping powerful officials,"" he said. ""It's an innate attraction to Chinese investors. They will automatically label the program as one with official backing after they hear the name of Trump's son-in-law.""

325,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

327,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

328, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

329,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

330,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

331,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

333,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

334, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

335,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

336,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

337,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

339,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

340, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company.

It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

342,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations.

345,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

346, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

347,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

348,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

349,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

351,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

352, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

353,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

354,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

355,,5252017,Reuters,5182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

357,Mark Kolakowski,5252017,Investopedia,5182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

358, ,5252017,CNBC,5182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

359,Brian Richards,5252017,Fool,5182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

360,Elena Cherney,5252017,MarketWatch,5182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

365,Rich Smith,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

367,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks’ ties to the sector. In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown. The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks’ involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices. The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules. Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain. The Fed’s proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator’s highest charge for the riskiest investments. The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns. In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities. In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt “competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy.” A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp, have also cited liquidity and price concerns. Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. Industry sources say the fight against the Fed’s proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.    Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground. ","

369,Mark Fahey,2232017,CNBC,2162017,"President Donald Trump's tax plan may cut the federal business income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but dozens of companies are already enjoying rates below the new maximum. The plan would be a windfall for retailers like Best Buy and CVS and for financial services companies like Visa and JPMorgan Chase, which tend to pay close to the 35 percent. On the other hand, companies that have access to substantial tax deductions and are already below 15 percent could suffer if the cut comes at the expense of closing tax loopholes. The average effective federal tax rate for profitable Fortune 500 companies was a little under 20 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a 2014 study by the progressive tax reform organization Citizens for Tax Justice. About 35 percent of those companies were already under Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. CTJ is in the process of updating those calculations, and most companies' tax rates have been fairly consistent over the long term. It's hard to know exactly how Trump's tax plan would affect individual companies, partly because the administration hasn't released the details of its proposal yet. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would make a ""phenomenal"" tax announcement in two or three weeks. On Wednesday he said tax reform was ""very well finalized"" but that it wouldn't come until after health-care reforms. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he wants to see the reforms passed before Congress goes on its August recess. According to Trump's published tax plan, ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes."" Mnuchin said the administration is looking at a combined plan with Republicans in Congress, who have been pushing a 20 percent business tax and a controversial border adjustment tax. The final mix of reforms could very well benefit companies that are currently paying more than 15 or 20 percent, while driving up taxes for companies that already have low rates thanks to loopholes. Trump's strategy for keeping the tax cuts revenue-neutral depends in part on eliminating some ""special interest loopholes."" ""You can make the basic observation that companies like Exxon Mobil that are routinely able to reduce their tax bill will likely benefit much less than companies in the retail sector, which traditionally pay a lot closer to 35 percent,"" said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at CTJ. ""Congress has enacted special tax breaks for a number of different industries, but retailers are generally unaffected and there aren't a lot of breaks designed for them."" Take a company like Amazon, which has paid 11 percent in taxes on its domestic income over the last eight years. According to the company's annual report, that rate was reached using a number of special deductions, including stock-based compensation deductions, accelerated depreciation deductions, research and development credits, and the domestic production activities deduction. Companies like Boeing (-1 percent from 2008 to 2012) and Honeywell (8 percent) use similar deductions and credits. ""The companies that tend to do the best tend to be companies that make a lot of capital investments, like utilities or manufacturers because the accelerated depreciation rules have been so generous over the last couple of decades,"" said Gardner. ""They give big rewards to anyone investing in factories or machinery."" Generally, the biggest deductions are more useful for companies in utilities, telecommunications, oil and gas, manufacturing and some pharmaceutical companies, while retailers, financial services, food companies and health-care companies tend to pay closer to the statutory rate. Take a look at all the profitable Fortune 500 companies below: The final impact of Trump's tax plan depends a lot on the revenue trade-offs that are included to pay for the cuts. A border tax, for example, would be a hit on retailers, but dropping the business tax rate would also disproportionately help retailers. Big companies may lose some deductions, but the plan also calls for a one-time repatriation of the $2.5 trillion in corporate cash sitting offshore at a 10 percent rate, which would save companies like Apple, Microsoft and Citigroup billions of dollars. As the plan stands now, it would increase the federal debt by $7.2 trillion over the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. An analysis by the Tax Foundation estimated revenues would be decreased by at least $4.4 trillion over the next decade, depending on the specific policy changes. Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it."" ",These companies could lose the most from Trump’s tax plan,0.9985
370,Bob Pisani,2232017,CNBC,2162017,"Home Depot is at another historic high on Tuesday following its excellent earnings report, but a major factor behind its stock price rise has been dividend hikes (it raised its dividend 29 percent on Tuesday), and an aggressive buyback program, including the new $15 billion share buyback program that it also announced. To give you an idea of just how big a $15 billion buyback is, the company's market cap is roughly $175 billion, so we are talking about buying back nearly 9 percent of the company. Even by the standards of the last decade, that is a big buyback. Home Depot is part of a select group of companies I call ""buyback monsters,"" companies that have bought back more than 25 percent of their shares since 2000. Why 2000? Because most companies hit their highest levels of shares outstanding between 2000 and 2006; since then, most companies have been reducing share count, in some cases aggressively. Consider Home Depot. In 2003, they had 2.36 billion shares outstanding, according to Factset. Today, they have 1.21 billion shares outstanding. That is half the shares they had outstanding 14 years ago. All other things being equal, that means earnings are twice as high as they would have been in 2003, when there were twice as many shares outstanding. Home Depot isn't alone. IBM had 1.9 billion shares outstanding in 1997, today it has about 950 million, again less than half what it had 20 years ago. ExxonMobil had 7 billion shares outstanding in 2000, today it has 4.1 billion, a reduction of about 42 percent. This is not a trend that is limited by any one sector. There are companies that have been aggressively reducing their share counts in Industrials, Technology, and Consumer: Industrials: share count reductionsNorthrup Grumman: 50 percent since 2003CSX: 29 percent since 20003M: 25 percent since 2000United Technologies: 25 percent since 2005 Technology: share count reductionsMicrosoft: 30 percent since 2004Intel: 30 percent since 2001Cisco: 32 percent since 2001 Why are there buybacks at all? They were originally used to support the issuance of stock options. The options increased the share count outstanding, so to keep the count down the company bought back shares. But as the opportunity for significant top-line growth waned, buybacks to reduce share counts became a separate strategy to prop up earnings growth. And that's my beef: Buybacks are a form of financial engineering. Here's another problem: It's not at all clear that buying companies just because they are buying back shares will be a successful investment strategy. Take IBM — despite being one of the most aggressive buyback monsters on the Street, you can't say IBM's stock price has soared in the last decade. In 2014, the company eased off a bit on its buybacks, and the stock headed south. It headed south because IBM was beset by fundamental growth issues: Its revenues from its old line businesses were shrinking and there was notrevenue from nascent businesses (like Watson and artificial intelligence) replacing it. The lesson: No amount of financial engineering like buying back shares can replace management's inability to grow the business. Not surprisingly, there are ETFs for all this, but their performance has been spotty. ThePowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF (PKW) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares in the previous 12 months. Top holdings include McDonald's, Boeing, and QUALCOMM. It has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in the last year, but it has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points over a two-year period. So just reducing shares doesn't necessarily mean that companies will outperform. A better approach might be that taken by the AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS), which uses a ""smart beta"" approach that screens not just for reduction of shares but also free cash flow, and no increase to leverage. The TTFS has outperformed the PKW by about 9 percentage points in the past two years. Do not expect buybacks to go away. Buybacks could become an even bigger business, if the whole business of tax reductions become a reality. Billions could be repatriated from overseas, and most strategists believe that a large amount of that money could find its way into buybacks. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Tariff concerns remain a key talking point on Wall Street when dissecting the market volatility fit over the past month, but the issue seems to be carrying less heft among corporate executives. Aurora Cannabis reported on Monday that revenue jumped 260 percent over the last 12 months, with kilograms produced climbing to 4,996 from 1,010 over the past year. SAP is buying Qualtrics, nabbing the company just before its planned IPO. ","Buyback binge is going strong, but here is why they are not the solution",0.9994
371,"George Budwell, Rich Smith, and Neha Chamaria",2232017,Fool,2162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, can be a powerful and smart way to pursue above-average income opportunities in the market. The short story is that ETFs provide instant diversification, thus lowering the risk of holding a single high-yield stock that may turn out to be a ticking time bomb later on down the road. Given the expansive universe of high-yield ETFs in existence at the moment, however, it's not exactly easy to choose the cream of the crop. Our Foolish team of dividend experts, though, think that the iShares Core High Dividend (NYSEMKT:HDV), the Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ), and the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:DWX) could all boost your portfolio's earnings power to the next level. Here's why. Image Source: Getty Images. George Budwell (iShares Core High Dividend): While the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund's yield of 3.31% won't exactly knock your socks off, this well-diversified ETF does come with a rock bottom expense ratio of 0.12% and a solid track record of producing outstanding returns on capital. Long story short, the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund has marched steadily northward since its inception approximately 6 years ago, outperforming most of its peers in the process: HDV data by YCharts. What's underneath the hood? This ETF tracks a dividend-weighted index of 75 U.S. equities that pay a better than average yield. And as an added measure, the fund also screens equities for high earnings potential and dividend sustainability in order to up the overall quality of its holdings. The net result is that the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund is made up of mostly dividend stalwarts like ExxonMobile, Chevron Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, among many others. That's an impressive roster of blue-chip companies by any measure and underscores why this ETF has performed so well during the market's lengthy bull run over the past several years. As a prime example, J&J has been able to maintain one of the strongest balance sheet ratings among U.S. equities for decades, despite its heavy investment in its dividend program and R&D activities. Pfizer is also a well-known cash cow with outstanding free cash flows and a superb balance sheet in its own right. In all, this dividend ETF offers a nice mix of high-quality equities, a respectable yield, and a bargain-basement expense ratio. Neha Chamaria (Vanguard REIT ETF): With a dividend yield of 6%, Vanguard REIT ETF is my top pic for income investors. As its name suggests, this ETF invests only in REITs, which also explains its high yields, though it isn't exactly a dividend-themed fund. As you might know, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their income to shareholders to avoid paying taxes. This ETF, which tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, holds 156 real estate investment trust stocks that invest in properties across diverse sectors, including healthcare, industrials, offices, residential, and hotels. You can get a fair idea about the diversity within the REITs this ETF offers when you realize that its top holdings include names like Simon Property Group, Public Storage, Prologis, and Equinix. At about 23%, retail REITs have the largest exposure in this ETF, and residential and specialized REITs come in next with about 16% share in assets each. You might be wondering why I'm optimistic about a REIT ETF in a rising interest rate scenario -- higher interest rates, after all, have traditionally hurt REIT valuations. Vanguard, however, has held up pretty strong in the past three months, and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to do so. One reason is that most of the ETF's top holdings have strong track records of growth in funds from operations and dividends. Just to give you an example, Simon Property's dividend has grown at an annual compounded rate of 13.2% in the past five years. Moreover, as Vanguard is a diversified ETF, there will ideally almost always be pockets of strength in its portfolio even during adverse times. Potential higher infrastructure spending under Donald Trump's presidency could, for instance, boost manufacturing activity and prospects for office and industrial REITs, allowing them to command higher rents. Likewise, higher consumer confidence bodes well for retail REITs, and so on. Finally, this ETF's expense ratio of 0.12% is not only substantially lower than those of industry peers, but also among the lowest in the REIT space. That means greater savings and higher returns for shareholders while they enjoy the hefty dividends along the way. Right now, the U.S. dollar is still not far off its five-year high, making companies' income earned (and dividends paid) in foreign currency worth relatively less when converted back into U.S. dollars. To my mind, that makes now a good time to look for foreign dividend payers as a promising investment -- because they'll be worth more once exchange rates turn around. My pick for this play on exchange rates is therefore the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF, which tracks the 100 highest-yielding dividend-paying companies outside the U.S. This $1 billion fund carries a hefty, but not unreasonable, expense ratio of 0.45%, but a market-beating dividend yield of 5.1%. Even after deducting expenses, the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF yields twice the average dividend yield on the S&P 500. Valuation-wise, this ETF's stocks carry an average P/E ratio of 17.1 -- which is also well below the S&P's average P/E of 25.7. The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF achieves diversification in its portfolio by capping exposure to any given region of the world at 25% (it's maxed out on financials right now, for example, and getting close to 25% on energy companies), and capping exposure to individual market sectors at 25% as well. Although DWX has underperformed over the past five years, it may finally be coming into its own here near the dollar's peak, and delivered a near 25% return to investors over the past year. My bet: The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF will continue to outperform as the dollar's value peaks, plateaus, and begins to drop off. ","

It finds its application as an intermediate product used as a feedstock in a wide range of industries such as packaging and films industries, automotive, construction and textile industry. Naptha and Ethane cracking are the most widely used ethylene production technologies across the globe. Ethylene is used for formulation of various derivatives such as Polyethylene(PE), Ethylene Oxide, Ethylene Dichloride(EDC) and others (Including ethyl benzene and styrene). Ethylene and its derivatives are used in the production of various chemical products such as High-density polyethylene (HDPE), Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), that are widely used in plastics and packaging industries. Moreover, on account of industrialization and booming automotive and packaging sector, increase in demand for ethylene is anticipated across the globe during 2016-2025.

373,,3022017,Reuters,2232017,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) will work to enhance the privacy, security and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, making it better suited to business applications, according to the founding companies, which said they plan to announce the initiative on Tuesday. The EEA joins a growing list of joint initiatives by large companies aiming to take advantage of blockchain, a shared digital record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. Companies in a wide range of industries are hoping that it can help them streamline some of their processes, such as the clearing and settling of financial securities. The EEA underscores the enthusiasm around the nascent technology, but also highlights some of the hurdles that companies must still overcome before they can deploy blockchain on a large scale. This includes ensuring that the technology can support the vast number of transactions processed by large corporations, while being secure enough to meet their stringent security standards. Unlike some other collaborative efforts, members do not need to pay a fee to participate in the EEA, for now. Ethereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications, was invented by 23-year-old programer Vitalik Buterin. Several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. Alex Batlin, global blockchain lead at BNY Mellon, one of the companies on the EEA board, said over the past few years banks and other enterprises have increased collaboration with the Ethereum development community, facilitating the creation of the EEA. “There is a lot more synergy in thinking than was ever possible before,” Batlin said. The EEA will collaborate with the non-profit foundation that promotes the development of Ethereum, the companies said. ","

374,Charles Bovaird,3022017,Investopedia,2232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs President Donald Trump's proposal to cut the top federal tax rate on business income to 15% would provide windfalls for certain companies such as financial services institution Visa Inc. (V) and retailer Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY), which generally pay close to the top rate of 35%, according to CNBC. Many investors will likely focus on Trump's joint address to Congress on February 28, during which he is expected to discuss his plans for tax reform, The Washington Post reported. However, many firms will likely derive little benefit from such tax reform, as they already have an effective tax rate below 15%. (For more, see also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.) While there are many companies that have paid a low effective rate in recent years, a perfect example is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The online retailer has enjoyed an effective tax rate of 11% on its domestic income over the last eight years, according to CNBC. Amazon harnessed several special deductions, including ones involving accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, and research and development credits, according to the company's annual report. Amazon is not alone in benefiting from this special treatment, as companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) are ""routinely able to reduce their tax bill,"" Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at tax policy think tank Citizens for Tax Justice (CTH) told CNBC. Amid this situation, Exxon Mobil and AT&T Inc. (T) paid effective tax rates of 14% and 7% between 2008 and 2012, CTJ data reveals. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and General Electric Company (GE) both had negative rates during that time, paying 2% and 11%,respectively. However, the special deductions that these companies have been leveraging are likely to disappear under Trump's plan, Stephan Unger, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Investopedia during an interview. The ""current special deduction possibilities are likely to get abandoned to make the system more transparent and efficient,"" he said. However, whether or not ""special tax treatments for specific companies"" will end up disappearing completely remains unclear, stated Unger. Tax expert Nate Smith offered a different point of view, stating during a separate interview with Investopedia that while ""certain industries (like oil and gas) benefit from specific deductions ... the deduction provisions that could be disappearing are not the thrust of what Trump's reform would target."" The more important matter is changing tax law so that companies will repatriate profits, said Smith. Currently, multinational corporations can keep these earnings overseas indefinitely, shielding them from the higher tax rates, he told Investopedia. Frequently, managing their international footprint is the means of minimizing tax expenses, said Smith. Originally, Trump's campaign tax proposal sought to rectify this situation, he noted. (For more, see also: Can Trump Tax Plan Bring Back Overseas Cash?) Because of policies like these, many global companies are paying very little in the way of taxes, Tenpao Lee, interim dean and professor of economics at Niagara University, stated during an Investopedia interview. Should lawmakers cut the top corporate income tax rate to 15%, it would give major companies greater motivation to move their profits back to the United States. However, the impact may not take effect immediately, said Lee, as companies would need time to adjust. For companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), the effect would be significant, whereas companies like Exxon Mobil and Amazon would see less of an impact, he told Investopedia.

375,Mark Fahey,3022017,CNBC,2232017,"President Donald Trump's tax plan may cut the federal business income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but dozens of companies are already enjoying rates below the new maximum. The plan would be a windfall for retailers like Best Buy and CVS and for financial services companies like Visa and JPMorgan Chase, which tend to pay close to the 35 percent. On the other hand, companies that have access to substantial tax deductions and are already below 15 percent could suffer if the cut comes at the expense of closing tax loopholes. The average effective federal tax rate for profitable Fortune 500 companies was a little under 20 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a 2014 study by the progressive tax reform organization Citizens for Tax Justice. About 35 percent of those companies were already under Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. CTJ is in the process of updating those calculations, and most companies' tax rates have been fairly consistent over the long term. It's hard to know exactly how Trump's tax plan would affect individual companies, partly because the administration hasn't released the details of its proposal yet. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would make a ""phenomenal"" tax announcement in two or three weeks. On Wednesday he said tax reform was ""very well finalized"" but that it wouldn't come until after health-care reforms. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he wants to see the reforms passed before Congress goes on its August recess. According to Trump's published tax plan, ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes."" Mnuchin said the administration is looking at a combined plan with Republicans in Congress, who have been pushing a 20 percent business tax and a controversial border adjustment tax. The final mix of reforms could very well benefit companies that are currently paying more than 15 or 20 percent, while driving up taxes for companies that already have low rates thanks to loopholes. Trump's strategy for keeping the tax cuts revenue-neutral depends in part on eliminating some ""special interest loopholes."" ""You can make the basic observation that companies like Exxon Mobil that are routinely able to reduce their tax bill will likely benefit much less than companies in the retail sector, which traditionally pay a lot closer to 35 percent,"" said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at CTJ. ""Congress has enacted special tax breaks for a number of different industries, but retailers are generally unaffected and there aren't a lot of breaks designed for them."" Take a company like Amazon, which has paid 11 percent in taxes on its domestic income over the last eight years. According to the company's annual report, that rate was reached using a number of special deductions, including stock-based compensation deductions, accelerated depreciation deductions, research and development credits, and the domestic production activities deduction. Companies like Boeing (-1 percent from 2008 to 2012) and Honeywell (8 percent) use similar deductions and credits. ""The companies that tend to do the best tend to be companies that make a lot of capital investments, like utilities or manufacturers because the accelerated depreciation rules have been so generous over the last couple of decades,"" said Gardner. ""They give big rewards to anyone investing in factories or machinery."" Generally, the biggest deductions are more useful for companies in utilities, telecommunications, oil and gas, manufacturing and some pharmaceutical companies, while retailers, financial services, food companies and health-care companies tend to pay closer to the statutory rate. Take a look at all the profitable Fortune 500 companies below: The final impact of Trump's tax plan depends a lot on the revenue trade-offs that are included to pay for the cuts. A border tax, for example, would be a hit on retailers, but dropping the business tax rate would also disproportionately help retailers. Big companies may lose some deductions, but the plan also calls for a one-time repatriation of the $2.5 trillion in corporate cash sitting offshore at a 10 percent rate, which would save companies like Apple, Microsoft and Citigroup billions of dollars. As the plan stands now, it would increase the federal debt by $7.2 trillion over the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. An analysis by the Tax Foundation estimated revenues would be decreased by at least $4.4 trillion over the next decade, depending on the specific policy changes. Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it."" ",These companies could lose the most from Trump’s tax plan,0.9985
376,Reuben Gregg Brewer,3022017,Fool,2232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

377,,3022017,MarketWatch,2232017,"The Dow Jones industrial average stormed past 21,000 for the first time Wednesday as investors absorbed President Trump’s address to Congress, in which he pledged business-friendly proposals like tax cuts, deregulation and an increase in infrastructure and defense spending. Wednesday’s sprint past 21,000 matched the previous record for 1,000-point gains, set in 1999 when the Dow ran from 10,000 to 11,000 in 24 trading sessions. “President Trump came out and gave a presidential speech, which reassured a lot of people who questioned whether his administration would reach normality,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “The political uncertainty has been one of the factors holding the market back in the face of an improving economy. The fact that political uncertainty may be starting to subside may be counted as really good news.” Stocks motored across the board Wednesday. The Dow closed at 21,115, a 1.4 percent gain on the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index increased 1.3 percent, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index was up 1.9 percent. Apple, Boeing and Goldman Sachs Group have propelled most of the gain in the Dow industrials during its 1,000-point dash. Wednesday was the biggest one-day point lift for the blue-chip index since Election Day 2016. The 30 stocks have continued to surge from below 19,000 without looking back. “In terms of percentage moves, the move in 1999 was much larger,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. “Nonetheless, this only reinforces how strong the rally has been since the election.” Detrick said the strong earnings season is pushing the market forward more than Trump. “This helps justify the gains, as it isn’t all based on hopes for tax reform or infrastructure spending,” he said. “There is real economic improvement now that has sparked much of the rally.” William Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday night that tightening monetary policy had become “more compelling,” making a rate increase more likely for March 15. Higher interest rates are good for banks’ loan business. The market responded, with JPMorgan Chase shares up 3.3 percent Wednesday and Citigroup shares up 2.9 percent. Wednesday’s gains overshadowed the reported pricing of Snap Inc. at $17 per share, which would value the parent of the popular disappearing-message app Snapchat at almost $24 billion and above the projected share range of $14 to $16. The stock is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the “SNAP” ticker. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes was 2.45 percent. The 30-year yield climbed above 3 percent. Crude oil declined, and gold fell to $1,249.80 per ounce as investors swarmed stocks. Analysts said they did not see anything tying down equities. “Sentiment keeps improving,” McMillan said. “With consumer confidence at 15-year highs, with manufacturing sentiment continuing to move up, the economy and business are actually quite sound.” Read more: The big-deal lesson from the (not so important) Dow 20,000 What the Yahoo sale tells us about stock market bubbles This could change everything we thought we knew about investing  ","Dow busts through 21,000 threshold on feel-good Trump message - The Washington Post",0.9953

The surge for stocks, on the heels of Trump’s speech, also comes as the expectation for a rate increase by the Federal Reserve as early as mid-March have increased significantly. The probability for a March rate increase stands at 66%, up from a probability of 35% on Tuesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “What’s really changed on the economic front is tough to say,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, in an interview. “But the Trump speech moved expectations higher. Now it’ll be a surprise if [the Fed doesn’t] raise rates.” Read:  This stock-market rally isn’t all about Trump’s newfound ‘tone’ Adding to that, on Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for a U.S. interest rate increase has become “a lot more compelling.” “The economy is doing well, as we can see from today’s inflation and manufacturing numbers and any additional stimulus will put it into even a higher gear, and stock markets like that,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “I think the Fed’s clear optimism about the economy, even when not factoring in a Trump boost, is feeding the positive sentiment in the markets at the moment,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in emailed comments. “Investors don’t fear rate increases like they have in the past, instead it’s the pace of tightening that they’re focused on, and three hikes this year is clearly palatable,” he added. However some investors still see prices for stocks getting lofty after a string of records for U.S. equity benchmarks in 2017. Substantial gains in the markets have sent valuations to highest levels in more than a decade, with some analysts warning of potential pullbacks. “When markets are extended and overbought, they are vulnerable to any shocks that could trigger pullbacks or corrections,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. The Dow industrials ran from clearing 20,000 for the first time to clearing 21,000 in 24 sessions, tying a record set in 1999 for the shortest 1,000-point gain. While the current jump is smaller on a percentage basis, it’s still psychologically compelling, especially when it took nearly two years for the Dow to reach 19,000 after it first passed 18,000, as markets were dealing with an earnings recession, Detrick said. “Now, earnings are picking up and we’re breaking out in quick fashion,” said Detrick. “The concern now is if we got to 22,000 quickly and hit a blowoff top. Some pullback is normal and we want to see a correction. No more than 5% to 7% would be perfectly normal considering the rally since the election.” Themis’s Kepner also said that at some point markets will need specifics on the fiscal stimulus to justify current price-to-earnings ratios. “But for now, it seems that investors are content with the reasonable tone of the president, while impending rate hikes are seen in the context of an improving economy,” Krosby said. On the data front, a report on personal income and outlays showed that the cost of goods and services outpaced household income, with the year-over-year inflation rising to the highest level since 2012. Higher pace of inflation is another reason the Fed might be eager to go ahead with rate normalization sooner rather than later. The manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.7% in February, its best level in more than two years. Meanwhile, construction spending declined 1% in January.

In what many saw as a rather reserved speech, the U.S. president said he would push for around $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, and promised “massive tax relief” for the middle class and tax cuts for corporations. Otherwise, the speech was lacking in firm details about his economic plans. Read: Trump asks leaders for unity over overhauling taxes and health care.

The blue-chip average rose for an 11th straight day for the first time since 1992, as well as its 11th straight record closing high—the longest such streak since 1987. The Dow had traded in negative territory for essentially the entire session, only breaking into the green with seconds to spare. “There was concern that the market was getting tired and that we were losing momentum, but there are still significant inflows, because now even the pessimists want a piece of the action. It’s momentum driven, not fundamentally driven,” said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors.

But there is weakness in the Trump-leadership stocks,” Glazer said. “Financials are notably weak, Goldman is notably weak. That’s due to both profit-taking and high valuations.” For the holiday-shortened week, major indexes posted gains. The Dow rose 1% on the week while the S&P added 0.7% and the Nasdaq rose 0.1%. That marked the fifth straight weekly advance for the S&P and the Nasdaq, and the third straight for the Dow. The Dow is up nearly 9.1% over the past three months, with investors attributing gains largely to Trump’s November election victory. Investors are betting that Trump’s policies on taxes and regulation will accelerate economic growth and boost corporate earnings, but concerns are growing over the administration’s ability to deliver on the tax plans. Markets saw little impact from a speech Trump gave at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he said that the U.S. tax code would be made more fair. Investors are also looking ahead to an address that Trump is scheduled to make to Congress on Feb. 28, where he is expected to provide details on his highly anticipated tax reform proposals.

381,,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world’s largest gathering of energy executives. Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said. Woods ran Exxon’s refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon’s growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding. “Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Woods said. “These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics.” The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs. “The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots,” Woods said. Exxon last month pledged to boost this year’s spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company’s spending plans as an example of “a true American success story.” Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year. “This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,” Trump said. When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief. The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports. Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production. Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said. “I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken,” he said. “It underestimates the power of technology.” Woods highlighted Exxon’s research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas. “The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating,” he said. Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors. ","

382,,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

383,Patti Domm,3092017,CNBC,3022017,"The power of the North American energy industry is that it transcends borders, and while it was interconnected way before NAFTA, it is becoming even more so. The ties are deep rooted. In the early 1900s, primitive power lines sent electricity crackling across the border between Texas and Mexico. Canada has long provided the U.S. hydroelectric power, and all three countries now send oil, refined fuels and natural gas back and forth across the northern and southern U.S. borders on a daily basis. With trade the hot topic in Washington and now for all three members of NAFTA, the fallout from the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement and the U.S. proposals about taxing goods at the border can't help but be an important topic when the global energy industry meets in Houston this week. In fact, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will deliver a keynote address on Thursday, which he tweeted would be about innovation and renewable energy. CERAWeek by IHS Markit runs Monday through Friday and participants include energy ministers from Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as CEOs from major oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Total. ""I expect to hear a great deal at CERAWeek from Prime Minister Trudeau and industry leaders about the importance and mutual benefit from the large cross-border energy [integration]. Whatever the eventual outcome of the NAFTA debate, they're not going to want to lose benefits,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS. The Trump administration promises to be a strong supporter of energy, removing regulatory hurdles for the industry and encouraging more U.S. drilling. Just last week former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was approved to be Energy Secretary. Perry has spoken positively about North American integration in the past, and until recently he was on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, which is building pipelines to take natural gas to Mexico. But the administration has also been critical of Mexico for what it claims are unfair trade practices and weak immigration controls. So even though the industry is intertwined, the future course for North American energy is murky. Guaranteed to be discussed at CERAWeek is the proposal from House Republicans to tax imports into the United States at a rate of 20 percent. The so-called border-adjustment tax is a major revenue generator for the House corporate tax reform plan. It is bound to generate as much debate in the energy industry gathering as it has in other affected industries, such as retail. Critics already say it would drive up both oil and gasoline prices. But proponents, among them big industrial companies, say the dollar would adjust by rising sharply and neutralizing some of the impact of higher prices. Conceivably, under the proposal, a barrel of oil from Canada could be taxed as it enters the United States, but the gasoline it is made into would not be taxed when it is sent to Mexico. Likewise, a barrel of U.S. crude would not be taxed as it enters Canada, but the gasoline that comes back down to New England could be taxed. The North American energy interconnections are complex and more established between the United States and Canada, which is the largest crude supplier to the United States and also a net exporter of electricity from connections that run along the border in numerous locations. Canada exports natural gas to the United States, and U.S. natural gas is sold in Canada. But the connections to Mexico are also growing, especially since the country embarked on a reform program to overhaul its energy industry and bring in new investment. It has also been aggressively planning new power generation. Mexico was importing about 4.2 billion cubic feet of U.S. natural gas per day in August, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and analysts say it could get to 5 billion in the near future. U.S. sales of gas to Mexico are also helping depressed U.S. natural gas prices from sinking even lower, analysts say. Gas pipeline exports to Mexico from the United States doubled since 2009. According to Citigroup, new cross-border pipeline capacity of 7 billion cubic feet is expected to come online by 2020, on top of the current 6 billion to 7 billion cubic feet. ""The growing energy integration of North America is very beneficial to all three countries,"" said Yergin. ""U.S. natural gas producers get additional markets, while Mexican consumers get lower-priced electricity generated with that gas. Canadians get markets for their oil, reducing U.S. reliance on Venezuelan oil, while American workers in manufacturing benefit from big equipment markets to the north."" Mexico also recently put out bids for offshore exploration, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the companies receiving awards. ""It will give them an opportunity to bring international technology and capital in to develop Mexico's deep water. Pemex never could have developed that,"" said Carlos Pascual, senior vice president of IHS Markit. Pascual has served as the U.S. State Department's special envoy for energy and coordinator for international energy affairs. He was also a former ambassador to Mexico. José Antonio González Anaya, director general of Pemex, will be a speaker at CERAWeek. Jaime Francisco Hernández Martínez, CEO of Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is also participating. ""The prospects are for additional gas supply only to continue to increase, and right now we see over the next five years, at least, relatively flat prices for natural gas globally, so the question then becomes, Where does American natural gas fit in?"" Pascual said. One solution is exporting it to Mexico, the largest buyer of U.S. natural gas. He said Mexico will also open up its unconventional drilling opportunities, holding its first round of bidding for unconventional oil and gas later this year. ""In the United States, there's been a huge benefit in the sale of natural gas to Mexico and also in the renewable-energy sector. Many of these companies buy GE equipment, for example. GE is a massive player here, particularly in wind turbines, so there's been a very significant boost to American commercial interests as a result of the development of natural gas and the power sector,"" Pascual said. The U.S. oil relationship with Canada, too, can only deepen when the Keystone XL pipeline is built. President Donald Trump waved on that controversial project shortly after his inauguration, and last week the White House said the TransCanada pipeline would be exempted from the new requirement that pipelines be built with U.S. steel. The Keystone would bring 800,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, before it heads to the Gulf Coast. ""This integration is not only beneficial from an economic point of view but also from a development point of view, which was one of the reasons it was encouraged in the first place,"" said Yergin.

384,Reuben Gregg Brewer,3092017,Fool,3022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

385,Jeff Reeves,3092017,MarketWatch,3022017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data. So it is no wonder that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have proven a poor investment, with a return of less than 20% since the March 2009 lows based on the performance of the popular iShares TIPS Bond ETF

Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

But since then, the index has struggled to hold on to further gains, recently dipping under 20,000 just before Christmas. Of course, roughly 90% returns since the bear market lows still annualizes out to over 10% a year, so some folks may not see China as a that bad of a bet. However, it is important to remember that American investors with exposure to Chinese equities often have imperfect exposure to this market.

This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general.

387,,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

388,,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, used an alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The attorney general’s office said in a letter on Monday that it found Tillerson had used an alias email address under the pseudonym “Wayne Tracker” from at least 2008 through 2015. Wayne is Tillerson’s middle name. The letter was sent to a New York state judge overseeing Schneiderman’s investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change. In a statement on Monday, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, “The email address, Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, is part of the company’s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics.” Jeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman’s office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. The letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account. It asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the “Wayne Tracker” email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved. The letter said that Exxon had produced some 60 documents bearing the “Wayne Tracker” email but never said it was used by Tillerson for relevant communications at Exxon. It asked the court to order Exxon to identify whether any other email accounts were used by Tillerson. “Exxon’s top executives, and in particular, Mr. Tillerson, have made multiple representations that are at the center of OAG’s (attorney general’s office) investigation of potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public,” the letter said. The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016. ","

390,Matthew Johnston,3162017,Investopedia,3092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On paper, the United States has the highest corporate income tax, at 35%, amongst all of the OECD industrialized nations. President Donald Trump has promised to cut that rate to 15% even as he has boasted that his corporate empire has managed to pay little to no income tax in some years. Yet, he is not alone, as hardly any company pays the full 35%, as indicated in a recent New York Times article. Some companies have even managed to pay absolutely zero in income taxes, and no, it is not because they weren’t profitable. (For more, see: How Trump's Proposals Can Impact Your Taxes.) The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), in a recent study, found that over the eight-year period from 2008 to 2015, 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 21.2%. Over that same period, exactly 18 companies, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E Corp., avoided paying a single penny of federal income tax. The complete list of the 18 corporations is listed below in a graphic from ITEP’s report: A total of 100 companies avoided paying income taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015, and their combined pretax income during that period totaled $336 billion. Yet, instead of paying $118 billion according to the 35% statutory income tax rate, the number of tax breaks applicable to these companies allowed them to earn a negative effective tax rate. That means they actually earned more in their after-tax income than in their pretax income, often due to tax rebates from the U.S. Treasury. There are several major ways that corporations avoid paying taxes, or manage to earn tax subsidies. One way is through finding ways to shift U.S. profits to foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates, a practice known as offshore tax sheltering. Another way is through the use of accelerated depreciation. The relative degree of freedom in tax laws has allowed companies to expense the cost of their capital at a faster pace than it actually wears out. This allows a company to declare less income and thus defer paying taxes until later years, and as long as the company continues to invest, the deferral of taxes can continue for an indefinite amount of time. The giving of stock options to employees, as a part of their compensation, is another avenue that has helped companies reduce their total tax bill. When the options are exercised, the difference between what employees pay for the stock and its market value can be claimed for a tax deduction. Finally, some industries such as research, oil and gas drilling, ethanol production, alternative energy, video game and film production, are privileged by the federal tax code to receive certain tax breaks. (For more, see: How Big Corporations Avoid Big Tax Bills.) Over the eight years, more than half of the total tax subsidies, which totaled $286 billion, went to just 25 companies. AT&T raked in the largest amount with a total of $38 billion in subsidies over the period. Other major recipients included Wells Fargo at $31.4 billion, J.P. Morgan Chase at $22.2 billion, Verizon at $21.1 billion, IBM at $17.8 billion and Exxon Mobil at $12.9 billion.   ",How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax | Investopedia,0.9678
391, ,3162017,CNBC,3092017,"BlackRock Inc, which wields outsized clout as the world's largest asset manager, planned on Monday to put new pressure on companies to explain themselves on issues including how climate change could affect their business as well as boardroom diversity. The move by BlackRock, a powerful force in Corporate America with $5.1 trillion under management, could bolster efforts like climate-risk disclosure practices developed by the Financial Stability Board, the international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. BlackRock, which holds stakes in most major U.S. corporations, identified its top ""engagement priorities"" for meetings this year with corporate leaders in documents to be posted on its website on Monday, with climate risk and boardroom diversity on the list. Reuters received advance copies of the materials. Michelle Edkins, set to oversee the outreach effort as head of a 30-person team, said BlackRock might want to hear from companies about how they are assessing the risk that climate change may pose to their operations. Edkins cited the example of how rising ocean levels could swamp a real estate company's valuable beachfront property. Some companies have shown leadership on the areas BlackRock considers priorities, Edkins said, while others need improvement. ""There are firms where we think they're probably not moving fast enough given the risks to the business,"" Edkins said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The action marked a step-up in BlackRock's advocacy with boards and executives, and comes after the fund giant was criticized by environmental and labor activists for not backing proxy resolutions dealing with climate change and other topics more often at shareholder meetings. BlackRock stopped short of pledging to vote more often against companies' management. It said it still prefers private meetings with executives and casts critical proxy votes only as a last straw. ""We can't micromanage,"" Edkins said. Activists said BlackRock deserves credit for making climate change a central focus. ""They have made a turn in the road. They are looking at their proxies differently,"" said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management in Boston. Outlining its priorities, BlackRock urged some companies to be ready to discuss concerns such as how they could use climate-risk disclosure practices developed by a Financial Stability Board task force. BlackRock also said it will expect that at companies in sectors associated with climate risk such as oil producers, miners or real estate companies, all directors should ""have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business"" and how a given company will address it. As a result of BlackRock's new initiative, Smith said Walden and others including a Seattle city employees' retirement system have withdrawn a proposal calling for the fund giant to review its proxy-voting process and record on climate change. Smith said BlackRock's new approach could make a difference such as on resolutions urging energy giants to report on the impact that public policies aimed at curbing climate change could have on their business. One such resolution at Exxon Mobil last year received support from around 38 percent of votes cast. BlackRock opposed the resolution and owned about 6 percent of the company at the time, securities filings show. Edkins said BlackRock's votes on such measures in the future would depend on circumstances like how they are worded. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment ahead of the company's proxy statement due next month. BlackRock also said it will look to understand how companies are working to increase boardroom diversity, such as adding more women. ""Diverse boards, including but not limited to diversity of expertise, experience, age, race and gender, make better decisions,"" BlackRock said in the documents. Some companies wrongly believe they already possess a diverse board of directors, Edkins said. ""A guy from Yale and a guy from Harvard does not count as diversity,"" Edkins said. BlackRock's guidance marks the latest investor call for corporate executives to pay more attention to matters to which they might have given little thought in the past. New deposits into funds that invest according to environmental, social or responsible governance criteria have been a rare bright spot for active fund managers lately. Big fund firms have taken notice. State Street Corp, a BlackRock rival, used International Women's Day last week to urge companies to improve their board diversity. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has advocated governance reforms in annual letters to other CEOs, such as urging them to avoid too much focus on short-term results. BlackRock said it also plans to press boards about worker issues in light of matters such as uneven wage growth. Edkins pointed to Wal-Mart Stores Inc as an example of a company that embraced the idea that higher wages can lead to a more-engaged workforce. ""Pay that doesn't seem to achieve some sense of equity within a company is likely to make an unattractive place to work,"" Edkins said.

Every dollar pledged to a successfully funded project resulted in $2.46 in additional revenue for the creator, leading to an estimated $5.3 billion in additional economic activity, says Penn. In total, the University estimates that Kickstarter has added $5.3 billion to the national GDP over the past eight years. It's also done its part as a responsible taxpayer. In 2016, the company says it paid a ""combined effective tax rate of 25%."" Image source: Kickstarter. Of course, unlike Exxon, Kickstarter is not a publicly traded stock. Privately held, it would ordinarily be under no obligation to disclose any of the facts and figures we've discussed here. That said, in 2015, Kickstarter reincorporated itself as a special kind of corporation -- a ""public benefit corporation."" PBCs also undertake to publish an annual benefit report updating the general public on the overall social impact their activities have had in the preceding year. It was this report that led to the revelations last week -- and we look forward to reading many more such reports as Kickstarter continues to lead the crowd-funding movement in years to come.

For long-term dividend investors, the best type of stock is one that can be bought and largely forgotten about, with the occasional checkup to make sure those dividend checks aren't in danger. A few of the Fool's contributors have identified four high-yield dividend stocks that fit this description. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), ONEOK (NYSE:OKE), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) are great buy-and-hold dividend stocks. Tim Green (Microsoft): Being a technology company, Microsoft is more susceptible to disruption than other dividend-paying stalwarts. But it's not a company that investors need to worry too much about. Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has shed its image as a tech dinosaur and aggressively embraced cloud computing. Microsoft's stranglehold on the productivity software market remains intact, its cloud-computing platform is a strong No. 2 player, and innovations like the HoloLens augmented reality headset could put Microsoft right at the center of the next computing revolution. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's dividend, currently yielding about 2.4%, isn't all that high. But it's superior to that of the average yield of stocks in the S&P 500, which yields less than 2%. Microsoft produces an incredible amount of free cash flow -- nearly $25 billion in fiscal 2016. This fueled not only $11 billion in dividend payments, putting the payout ratio at about 44%, but also $16 billion of share buybacks. There's still plenty of room to grow the dividend going forward, even without much earnings growth. Microsoft's cash-rich balance sheet is another reason the stock is attractive to dividend investors aiming to buy and hold for many years. Microsoft had net cash of $37.8 billion at the end of the latest quarter, providing a massive cushion that can sustain the dividend even in the roughest economic conditions. While there are higher-yielding stocks available, Microsoft is a good option for long-term investors. Brian Feroldi (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): It is natural for income-focused investors to want to own stocks that offer up higher yields than the market in general. However, picking the right high-yield stocks can be tricky, since a massive payout can sometimes actually be a warning sign. One alternative that is available to all investors is to instead invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on dividend stocks with above-average yields. If that sounds like a smart way to go, then I'd suggest that you give the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF a closer look. This passively managed ETF owns more than 400 stocks that have higher yields than the market in general. Its biggest holdings are all names that investors are familiar with -- think Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson -- which also provides investors with an extra layer of stability. The VYM currently offers a dividend yield of 3%, which is more than 50% higher than that of the S&P 500 average yield. Better yet, this fund's 10-year total return -- which accounts for the reinvestment of dividends -- is neck and neck with the S&P 500. VYM Total Return Price data by YCharts. Despite all of its benefits, Vanguard only charges a minuscule 0.08% expense ratio to access this ETF. Thus, if you are after a high yield but don't want to pick individual stocks, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF could be an excellent choice for you. Dan Caplinger (ONEOK): The plunge in energy prices in 2015 hurt companies throughout the industry, and even midstream infrastructure plays like ONEOK took big hits in their share prices. Yet after losing 70% of its share price, ONEOK has surged in the past year, nearly tripling as investors have figured out that not all companies have the same exposure to crude oil prices as others. ONEOK has an impressive slate of infrastructure assets, helping in the gathering process of natural gas from the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-Continent regions of the U.S. and then processing, storing, and transporting it to key market centers in the energy industry. That business relies more on production volume than on price, and although the producers that ONEOK works with transport more natural gas when prices are favorable, the energy transportation giant has still been able to produce solid results as oil and natural gas prices have rebounded. ONEOK currently has a yield of 4.5%, but that figure should go up when the company completes its planned acquisition of its ONEOK Partners (NYSE:OKS) master limited partnership. Once the MLP deal is complete, ONEOK expects to boost dividends by a fifth, which should help the yield even further. As long as energy prices remain strong enough to induce its clients to send natural gas through its infrastructure network, ONEOK will be in position to keep delivering income to its investors. Matt DiLallo (Enterprise Products Partners): Pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has an excellent track record of paying investors an above-average dividend. In fact, since going public in 1998, the company has raised its payout 59 times, including in each of the past 50 quarters. These haven't been token increases, either, with its last payout representing a 5.1% raise over the prior year. All these increases have added up over the years, with the company currently yielding a very generous 5.8%. That payout is about as safe as they come. First of all, more than 85% of Enterprise's cash flow comes from fee-based service contracts, which provides it with very stable cash flow. Furthermore, the company pays out less than 80% of its cash flow, which is well below the near-100% payout ratios of the average MLP. Finally, the company has a top-notch balance sheet, evidenced by the fact it has one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs. Add it up, and Enterprise has the financial strength to maintain its distribution rather easily. That said, the company is more likely to maintain its distribution growth streak than simply keep things status quo. Fueling that growth potential is the fact that it has $6.7 billion of growth projects under construction and several additional projects under development. These new assets should enable the company to continue growing its cash flow, giving it more money to return to investors. Needless to say, this is one dividend stock that will not cause investors any worry. ","

394,Jeff Reeves,3162017,MarketWatch,3092017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                   249% run from its bear-market close on March 9, 2009 — and the 219% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data. So it is no wonder that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have proven a poor investment, with a return of less than 20% since the March 2009 lows based on the performance of the popular iShares TIPS Bond ETF

However, there’s also a good chance that the Federal Reserve will quickly act to keep inflation in check now that it has been striking a more hawkish tone.

But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

Gold is volatile, yes, but seems a decent bet going forward for tactical traders. But remember the history of gold’s performance since 2009, and don’t treat this volatile asset as a sure thing to buy and hold long-term.

But since then, the index has struggled to hold on to further gains, recently dipping under 20,000 just before Christmas. Of course, roughly 90% returns since the bear market lows still annualizes out to over 10% a year, so some folks may not see China as a that bad of a bet. However, it is important to remember that American investors with exposure to Chinese equities often have imperfect exposure to this market.

This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

Of course, the ETF had a heck of a 2016 as energy stocks bounced back with a vengeance; the sector-specific fund tacked on about 25% last year to more than double the S&P 500’s returns. So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general. Profits remain seriously under pressure at both Big Oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp.

395, ,3232017,Reuters,3162017,"Imperial Oil Limited, incorporated on May 1, 1978, is an integrated oil company. The Company is engaged in all the phases of the petroleum industry in Canada, including exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas. The Company's operations are conducted in three segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. The Upstream operations include the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas, synthetic oil and bitumen. Downstream operations consist of the transportation and refining of crude oil, blending of refined products and the distribution and marketing of those products. The Chemical operations consist of the manufacturing and marketing of various petrochemicals. Upstream The Company is involved in the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas in Canada. The Company holds an interest in the Kearl oil sands project, a joint venture with ExxonMobil Canada Properties. The Kearl project recovers shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's Kearl's net bitumen production was approximately 118,000 barrels per day and gross production was approximately 120,000 barrels per day. The Company holds an interest in Syncrude, a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and upgrade it to produce a synthetic crude oil. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped to certain of the Company's refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's Syncrude's net production of synthetic crude oil was approximately 67,000 barrels per day and gross production was approximately 68,000 barrels per day. The Company's Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to certain of the Company's refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. As of December 31, 2016, net production at Cold Lake was approximately 138,000 barrels per day and gross production was approximately 161,000 barrels per day. The Company's production of liquids, bitumen and natural gas is derived from wells located in Canada. The Company's bitumen leases include approximately 194,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of approximately 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The Company also has approximately 80,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the Company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totaling approximately 193,000 net acres, which include approximately 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area, approximately 34,000 net acres of oil sands in the Aspen area and approximately 30,000 net acres of oil sands in the Corner area. The Company's Syncrude joint venture leases cover approximately 63,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic oil acreage. The Company holds interests in an additional 1,185,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in the western provinces related to crude oil and natural gas. The Company's land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration license (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of approximately 252,000 net acres and significant discovery license (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea areas of approximately 183,000 net acres.

If you invest for income, collecting your dividends is the most important thing. You don't care what's going on in an industry or what the outlook is for the stock market. You want to get paid on time and, preferably, with regular dividend hikes thrown in the mix, too. If that sounds like you, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are two dividends stocks you'll love. Enterprise Products Partners is one of the largest midstream oil and gas players in the country. It uses its network of pipes, storage, and processing facilities to get those fuels from where they are drilled to where they are used. Here's the interesting thing: The vast majority of its business is fee-based. That means volatile energy prices aren't that important to Enterprise -- only demand for its pipes and facilities. Image source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. This helps explain why the partnership has been able to increase its distribution for 50 consecutive quarters (the annual streak, just so you know, is up to 20 years). That includes right through the deep oil downturn that started in mid-2014. Enterprise has also managed to keep an average coverage ratio of around 1.2 times of late, providing a layer of safety for its distribution. Enterprise continues to invest for the future. It has roughly $6.7 billion worth of projects under construction today. Those projects will come online between now and 2019 and will support further distribution growth. This industry giant and its generous 6% (or so) distribution yield is a great option for dividend investors who hate risk. ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest integrated oil and natural gas companies, is another energy player that should be on the income short list. It has a roughly 3.7% dividend yield and, more importantly, it has increased its dividend every year for the past 34 years. You might highlight Chevron Corp.'s (NYSE:CVX) 29 years and 4% yield as a better deal, but there's more to a dividend increase than there appears. Exxon increased its dividend in the second quarters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Chevron increased its dividend in the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 -- it held the dividend steady for 10 quarters, two and a half years, in between. But because of timing, Chevron's annual dividend streak remained intact. Exxon's regular yearly increases are the better option if you don't like risk. EPD Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Exxon is one of the most conservative and best-run oil majors. For example, its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of around 15% is at the low end of the industry. Sure, it has added debt to maintain its capital spending and dividend through the oil downturn, like most of its peers, but it is still conservatively financed. On the operational front, it has long been among the industry's best performers on return on invested capital. This metric measures how well a company invests its shareholders' money. Regular dividend hikes backed by a solid balance sheet and a well-run company. That's the kind of stock risk-averse investors could love, particularly since the yield is currently toward the high end of the company's historical range. Stock prices go up and down -- all investors know that. Dividend investors, though, know that those price swings often open up opportunities in dividend stocks that keep on paying in good times and bad. If you can step back from the stock price and focus, instead, on the dividend, your risk equation changes, and price volatility suddenly becomes an opportunity to own great dividend payers like ExxonMobil and Enterprise Products Partners. If you hate risk, you can easily take solace in the regular distributions this pair has continued to pay and grow despite one of the worst energy downturns in recent history. ","

397,Lee Samaha,3232017,Fool,3162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The shocks to oil prices created by the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the revolution in Iran in 1979 had far reaching consequences that still affect investor thinking today. Analyzing the aftermath of the ensuing energy crisis and stagflation (high inflation with stagnant growth) leads to one key conclusion oil stock pickers need to be aware of: the demand for oil is not price inelastic. Price elasticity of demand simply means that as the price of a good goes up or down its demand will adjust accordingly -- usually as price goes down, demand goes up. Therefore, when oil perma-bulls make the commonly heard argument that oil demand is price inelastic, they are saying that as oil prices rise, demand will stay constant. Image source: Getty Images This is important because it implies that oil demand won't taper off and consumers won't start using alternatives -- a bullish argument for oil.However, the evidence from the aftermath of the energy crises is that demand, at least past the short-term, is actually price elastic. In other words, demand can go down as prices go up. As you can see below, oil prices dictate the direction of oil stocks. The chart shows oil prices alongside a leading energy ETF, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEMKT:XLE), which has ExxonMobile Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) as its largest holdings, along with a leading oil equipment and services ETF, the iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equip. (NYSEMKT:IEZ), which has Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) as its top two stocks. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Incidentally, there is a perfectly logical reason why oil services companies, like Schlumberger and Halliburton, should be more affected by spot oil price movements than oil exploration and production (E & P) companies (ExxonMobile and Chevron). Specifically, earnings at services companies are more dictated by near-term oil prices, which affect demand for oil field services, while E & P companies are better valued with their long-term oil reserves in the ground in mind, along with their exploration potential. The oil price shocks referenced above were dramatic by any measure. After adjusting for inflation, the Arab oil embargo crisis of 1973 saw oil prices jump from $20 to around $50 in no time -- an increase of 150% -- while the Iranian revolution led to an increase from around $55 to near $120 -- a near 120% increase. There are two arguments to suggest that the impact of these events had significant effects on demand. First, let's look at US motor vehicle fuel efficiency, a very important determinant of global oil demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates world oil demand in 2016 was 96.6 million barrels per day (mbpd), with the U.S. responsible for around 21%, and U.S. motor gasoline demand (9.3 mbpd) responsible for 9.6% of total world demand. The chart below shows how the crises spurred increases in fuel efficiency, with an inflexion in 1973 and a huge jump in 1979 -- evidence that higher oil prices will change thinking about fuel economy and reduce oil demand. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Logarithmic scale. The second chart shows energy inputs into electricity plants in the U.S. As you can see below, in 1971 oil products were the third largest contributor, but following the oil crises of the 1970s actions were taken to wean electricity production away from oil and toward coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Again, it's a demonstration of the fact that oil demand can readjust to higher prices -- oil products are pretty much irrelevant to U.S. electricity production now. Data source: International Energy Agency Headline Data. ktoe is kilotonne of oil equivalent The evidence from the actions taken following the energy crises suggests that oil demand isn't as price inelastic as many oil bulls may assume it to be -- a key concern if you are pricing in significant oil price increases in future. Moreover, given the importance of U.S. gasoline demand, and the fact that 70% of petroleum in the U.S. has been used for transportation in recent years, what happens to global oil demand if the U.S. embarks on a wide-scale shift to energy-efficient electric vehicles? Even if you are bullish on oil in the long-term -- and there is a case for emerging markets to propel demand -- it might make sense to balance risk by investing in stocks that benefit from trends like electrification of vehicles and the use of natural gas.

399,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"The sale of stakes in the Jotun, Balder and Ringhorne fields, along with some related production assets and properties, had long been rumored in local media. “It’s a natural part of business to assess whether such assets could be worth more to others than they are to us. We’ll remain a significant investor in Norway however,” Exxon spokesman Tore Revaa said. The fields sold had daily output of 54,000 barrels of oil equivalents in 2016, while Exxon’s remaining Norwegian stakes yielded about 170,000 barrels per day. Norwegian financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv, citing unnamed sources, said the deal was valued at close to 8 billion Norwegian crowns ($935 million). The companies declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Point Resources, which is majority owned by HitecVision, will have output of about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent following the deal, which could grow to about 80,000 barrels in 2022, it said in a separate statement. “Given the number of development plans and other opportunities, no redundancies are expected within the combined company as a result of the transaction,” it added. Following the deal, Point’s reserves and contingent resources will amount to about 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. The switch of ownership, which the companies hope to complete in the fourth quarter of 2017, must be approved by the Norwegian government. Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement the deal could bring more diversity and competition to the oil industry. “The transaction ... is exciting because it makes Point a significant player while Exxon Mobil remains a large producer,” he added.

400,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas on Wednesday kicked an Exxon Mobil Corp lawsuit seeking to thwart two states from pursuing a fraud case over climate change to a Manhattan court, saying his court wasn’t the best place to resolve the dispute. A group of state attorneys general, led by New York’s Eric Schneiderman, brought a securities fraud suit against the world’s largest publicly traded oil company in 2015 claiming it  misled investors by soft-pedaling the dangers of climate change. Exxon criticized their case as intended to get the company and others in the oil and gas industry to change their positions on climate change. It responded with its own suit in U.S. District Court in Dallas. That suit argued the states conspired with climate activists to target Exxon and the states’ demands for documents dating back 40 years violated its rights to protection against unreasonable searches and were abusive. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade, who earlier sought to question Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey over Exxon’s claims the original fraud lawsuit was biased, ruled in favor of Healey and her New York counterpart. He wrote his court was not the proper venue because events at issue in the case took place in New York. But the judge’s decision questioned whether the two AGs “are trying to hide something,” citing an agreement with climate activists not to publicly discuss their contacts. He also said the agreement should be open to discovery by Exxon attorneys. Exxon had argued that the requests for documents were, as the judge summarized it, tools to cultivate the political goals of Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Despite having the case transferred to Manhattan, an Exxon spokesman said the company was gratified the judge agreed its “claims involve important issues,” adding: “We look forward to continuing the case in that court.” Healey also lauded the decision to move the case, saying “we will continue to argue that this frivolous lawsuit should be dismissed.” Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the judge’s remarks in the ruling were “riddled with factual errors and oil industry spin,” and said Exxon was free to make the same claims in New York but “so far, inexplicably have not done so.” The case is 4:16-cv-00469 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division.

401,Todd Shriber,3302017,Investopedia,3232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The legend of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), the stock, continues to grow. Shares of the e-commerce juggernaut jumped 2.1 percent to another record high Wednesday. As of March 28, Amazon – now home to a $418 billion market value – was the fifth largest holding in the S&P 500. On that date, Amazon trailed Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) by a single basis point in the benchmark U.S. equity index. Predictably, Amazon's ascent is benefiting some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Excluding one brand new ETF, 14 ETFs hit record highs Wednesday. It is not a coincidence that two of these ETFs – the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF (FDIS) – feature large allocations to Amazon. Those are cap-weighted ETFs, and with Amazon being the largest consumer discretionary name by market value, XLY, FDIS and rival discretionary ETFs usually feature large weights to the stock. (See also: Amazon Hits All-Time High as Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Market Cap.) XLY's weight to Amazon is now about 13.7 percent, meaning that of the roughly 100 ETFs that feature exposure to the stock, perhaps as few as one have larger Amazon weights than XLY. Home to $11.9 billion in assets under management, XLY is the largest consumer discretionary ETF in the U.S. Meanwhile, with an annual fee of just 0.084 percent, FDIS has the honor of being the least expensive U.S. discretionary ETF. The Fidelity ETF is a credible Amazon play as well, with a weight of just over 11 percent to the stock. (See also: Invest in Consumer Discretionary With This ETF.) Shares of Seattle-based Amazon are up 16.6 percent year to date, and data suggest that some investors are turning to ETFs as avenues for exposure to the stock. XLY has added $330 million in new assets, while FDIS has seen inflows of $10.2 million. In the case of FDIS, that may not sound like much, but that is a decent percentage of the ETF's $263.4 million in assets (as of Feb. 28). Given Amazon's now massive market value and its 46 percent gain over the past year, it might be argued that upside from here will be hard to come by. However, Barclays initiated coverage of the stock Wednesday with an overweight rating and a price target of $1,120, speculating that Amazon's market value will one day top $1 trillion. The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN), the largest dedicated internet ETF, has added $40.3 million in new assets this year. Amazon is the second largest of FDN's 42 holdings at a weight of 8.42 percent. (See also: The One ETF to Own the Top Internet Company Stocks.)

402,David Mack,3302017,CNBC,3232017,"Ford announced on Tuesday the company would invest $1.2 billion in three facilities in Michigan where it will build trucks and SUVs, and store electronic data. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to link the news to his efforts to increase manufacturing by automakers within the US.

announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS! Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway also heralded the news on Twitter, suggesting Trump deserved credit: ""Two weeks after @POTUS met with auto execs...Ford plans 'significant' investments in 3 plants,"" she tweeted. @KellyAnnePolls: Two weeks after @POTUS met with auto execs...Ford plans 'significant' investments in 3 plants http://detne.ws/2nG5546 via @detroitnews #jobs The problem? The investment announced on Tuesday actually stemmed from a 2015 deal negotiated between Ford and the United Auto Workers union. Under that 2015 collective bargaining agreement, Ford committed itself to investing $9 billion in US plants with the expectation of creating or retaining 8,500 jobs across a number of states, including Michigan. ""The majority of what was announced today is part of the 2015 UAW contract,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker told BuzzFeed News via email. ""The $850 billion at Michigan Assembly Plant was part of the contract, as was the Romeo Engine Plant. The $200 million data center was not part of the UAW contract, but it wouldn't be because there are no hourly jobs at the data center."" When asked if the White House did anything during a meeting with automakers that may have led to the Michigan announcement, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, ""I think there's been some regulatory effort and some commitments on the regulatory efforts going forward in the future that I think may have played a role."" Felker also said that Ford reached out to the White House about its plans shortly before 8 a.m. ET — about 90 mins after Trump sent his tweet. Before he was even inaugurated as president, Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving to Mexico — but the  automaker had no plans of shuttering the factory. ""Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,"" Trump tweeted on Nov. 17. ""I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!"" While Ford had been planning to move the production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico, the company  said its Louisville plant was not set to close, or even lose any jobs, because of the expanded production of another vehicle, the Ford Escape.

The investment announced on Tuesday actually stemmed from a 2015 deal negotiated between Ford and the United Auto Workers union. Under that 2015 collective bargaining agreement, Ford committed itself to investing $9 billion in US plants with the expectation of creating or retaining 8,500 jobs across a number of states, including Michigan. ""The majority of what was announced today is part of the 2015 UAW contract,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker told BuzzFeed News via email. ""The $850 billion at Michigan Assembly Plant was part of the contract, as was the Romeo Engine Plant. The $200 million data center was not part of the UAW contract, but it wouldn't be because there are no hourly jobs at the data center."" When asked if the White House did anything during a meeting with automakers that may have led to the Michigan announcement, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, ""I think there's been some regulatory effort and some commitments on the regulatory efforts going forward in the future that I think may have played a role."" Felker also said that Ford reached out to the White House about its plans shortly before 8 a.m. ET — about 90 mins after Trump sent his tweet. Before he was even inaugurated as president, Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving to Mexico — but the  automaker had no plans of shuttering the factory. ""Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,"" Trump tweeted on Nov. 17. ""I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!""

There are many things to love about dividend-paying stocks. Carefully selected ones make for wonderful sources of current income, while reinvesting dividends allows you to accumulate more shares of stock, which can turbocharge your total returns over the long term. Moreover, dividend stocks in general have been shown to outperform non-dividend payers over the long haul. Companies that have great long-term records of paying dividends make for an ideal pool from which to fish for high-quality dividend stocks. Image source: Getty Images. A relatively small number of companies across various industries have track records of paying uninterrupted dividends for more than 100 years. These include such well-known companies as industrial titan General Electric, personal care products giant Colgate-Palmolive, beverage king Coca-Cola, and oil behemoth ExxonMobil, which have paid dividends for 118, 122, 124, and 135 consecutive years, respectively. That's right -- since 1816. America was a young country then, with a mere 18 states in the union in April 1816, when our dividend superstar was founded by a group of business people concerned about fire. The company? The York Water Company (NASDAQ:YORW), the oldest publicly traded water utility in the United States. York Water is a small-cap stock that pays a dividend that currently yields 1.9%. Image source: Getty Images. It's not surprising that a water utility is believed to have the longest streak among American companies of paying consecutive dividends. Water utilities have several traits that make them models of revenue and earnings consistency and predictability. For one, they can count on steady demand for their product regardless of economic conditions. Moreover, water utilities are regulated and natural monopolies, so they have high barriers to entry. In addition to having to comply with federal water standards, their core businesses are regulated by the public utility commissions in the state or states in which they operate. Among other things, these agencies regulate rates utilities can charge. The fact that water companies' core businesses are regulated doesn't mean that they don't have the potential to earn higher rates of return on their invested capital than their state regulators allow. Some water utilities operate market-based businesses. York Water doesn't operate such businesses, or at least none of any significance. However, most of the larger water companies do. For instance, American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK), the largest investor-owned water and wastewater utility in the United States, builds, operates, and maintains water systems for military bases under long-term contracts with the U.S. government. While these contracts are obtained on a bid basis, companies can set their own rates. American Water also has a business that sells water and related services to natural gas exploration and production companies operating in the Appalachian Basin. The York Water Company provides water and wastewater services to a total of about 194,000 people through approximately 66,000 service connections. Its territory includes 48 municipalities located in York and Adams Counties in the south-central region of Pennsylvania. In addition to York Water's dividend streak of 201 consecutive years being second to none in corporate America, the company has a solid record of increasing its dividend. York Water has hiked its dividend for the past 20 consecutive years. Data by YCharts. While dividends are very important to many investors, they're not everything. Most investors care about total capital appreciation, which is stock price appreciation plus dividends. York Water makes a splash on this front, too. It's crushed the S&P 500 over the last approximately 22 years: Maximum chart period shown. Data by YCharts. York Water stock's more recent return picture is also attractive, both relative to the broader market and other water utility stocks. York Water's three-year total return ranks third behind Middlesex Water and American Water Works among the eight water utilities that operate in the U.S. that have market caps over $300 million. Data by YCharts. I personally favor American Water Works among water utilities because its industry-leading size and geographic diversity provide it with greater potential than its smaller peers to grow by acquisitions. However, York Water is the safest water utility, in my opinion, which makes it a solid choice for conservative investors. Notably, York Water had the best free cash flow (FCF) among water utilities operating in the U.S. over the last 12 months, and was only one of two companies that had a positive FCF, with Aqua America being the other. FCF is a better metric than earning on which to gauge a company's performance, as ""earnings"" are simply an accounting metric -- and, of course, dividends are paid out of cash. Moreover, York Water's cash dividend payout ratio (dividends paid divided by FCF) is only 41.1%, indicating that the company has room to continue to increase its dividend. ","

408,Todd Shriber,4062017,Investopedia,3302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The legend of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), the stock, continues to grow. Shares of the e-commerce juggernaut jumped 2.1 percent to another record high Wednesday. As of March 28, Amazon – now home to a $418 billion market value – was the fifth largest holding in the S&P 500. On that date, Amazon trailed Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) by a single basis point in the benchmark U.S. equity index. Predictably, Amazon's ascent is benefiting some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Excluding one brand new ETF, 14 ETFs hit record highs Wednesday. It is not a coincidence that two of these ETFs – the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF (FDIS) – feature large allocations to Amazon. Those are cap-weighted ETFs, and with Amazon being the largest consumer discretionary name by market value, XLY, FDIS and rival discretionary ETFs usually feature large weights to the stock. (See also: Amazon Hits All-Time High as Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Market Cap.) XLY's weight to Amazon is now about 13.7 percent, meaning that of the roughly 100 ETFs that feature exposure to the stock, perhaps as few as one have larger Amazon weights than XLY. Home to $11.9 billion in assets under management, XLY is the largest consumer discretionary ETF in the U.S. Meanwhile, with an annual fee of just 0.084 percent, FDIS has the honor of being the least expensive U.S. discretionary ETF. The Fidelity ETF is a credible Amazon play as well, with a weight of just over 11 percent to the stock. (See also: Invest in Consumer Discretionary With This ETF.) Shares of Seattle-based Amazon are up 16.6 percent year to date, and data suggest that some investors are turning to ETFs as avenues for exposure to the stock. XLY has added $330 million in new assets, while FDIS has seen inflows of $10.2 million. In the case of FDIS, that may not sound like much, but that is a decent percentage of the ETF's $263.4 million in assets (as of Feb. 28). Given Amazon's now massive market value and its 46 percent gain over the past year, it might be argued that upside from here will be hard to come by. However, Barclays initiated coverage of the stock Wednesday with an overweight rating and a price target of $1,120, speculating that Amazon's market value will one day top $1 trillion. The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN), the largest dedicated internet ETF, has added $40.3 million in new assets this year.

409,Elizabeth Gurdus,4062017,CNBC,3302017,"With oil prices on the rise, Jim Cramer took to technician Carolyn Boroden's charts to determine whether the uptick is just a one-off or if it's time to get bullish. On Tuesday, oil prices closed just shy of a one-month high on news of a decline in U.S. crude and product inventories, with U.S. light crude settling at $51.03 a barrel. Boroden, Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com and the technician behind FibonacciQueen.com, began by examining the chart of crude oil for any notable patterns. She noticed that oil prices have been seeing both higher highs and higher lows, a healthy trend that could mean near-term upside if the pattern repeats itself.""As long as oil can stay above its floor of support at the $45 to $47 area, Boroden believes it can go higher, and if it clears just a few more hurdles of resistance, then she wouldn't be surprised to see if crude ends up rallying from $50 and change all the way up to $57,"" Cramer said.If oil prices are set to move up, there would be some technical clues in the stocks of big oil producers, so Boroden turned to their charts to determine any tangible effects.Boroden typically tracks the size and length of past swings, and being the ""Fibonacci Queen,"" runs them through a series of Fibonacci ratios to find key dates or price levels.The charts of ExxonMobil and Chevron Corporation showed key support levels for both names. Exxon, which currently trades around $82, has one floor of support at $79 and a second from $76 to $77.""She says that as long as the stock holds above at least one of these zones, then Exxon's more than likely to rally here.

Boroden noted that Chevron's recent $106 low suggested the stock could be ready for a rally.""Longer term, she wouldn't be surprised if Chevron can sail to $122,"" Cramer said.But if either Exxon or Chevron break under their lowest floors of support, Cramer said Boroden's points are negated, and all bets are off.Boroden's favorite two charts were from Pioneer Natural Resources and EOG Resources, two massive independent oil and gas producers.The technician noticed that each of Pioneer Natural Resources' recent moves down were more or less symmetrical, and were each followed by a nudge upward.""The key here is that these symmetry projections identify an important floor of support for Pioneer, running from $171 to $176,"" Cramer said. ""Given the stock's recent run up to $187, that floor might not seem all that comforting, but as long as this support holds, then Boroden believes that Pioneer can keep climbing.""EOG, which currently trades around $97, showed a recent double-bottom pattern, giving Boroden insight into another floor of support between $91 and $93.Cramer's bottom line?

""Given the stock's recent run up to $187, that floor might not seem all that comforting, but as long as this support holds, then Boroden believes that Pioneer can keep climbing."" EOG, which currently trades around $97, showed a recent double-bottom pattern, giving Boroden insight into another floor of support between $91 and $93. Cramer's bottom line? ""The charts ... suggest that many of these oil stocks could be ready to take off given the recent rebound in the price of crude,"" he said. ""If you believe oil can hold here or even keep rallying, then you've got to do some buying, and Boroden will turn out to be absolutely right."" Watch the full segment here: Questions for Cramer?

410,Bryan Dean Wright,4062017,CNBC,3302017,"On Monday, President Trump  signed into law a rollback of internet privacy rules in a decision widely condemned by Democrats and privacy advocates. Opposition to the bill centered on one flawed – though admirable – argument, namely that Corporate America should not be allowed to snoop on people's digital lives. But make no mistake, this law has nothing to do with privacy. Instead, it has everything to do with answering a question that will shape America's economy in the 21st century. Who should profit from the tech revolution? (Spoiler alert: unless we do something about it, the answer will not be you.) You're a Russian and you fix elections. In exchange for what we do, we expect something in return. In modern times, that's usually a wage, a retainer, or salary. In years gone by, it was housing, food, or a chance to shop at the company store. To explain, take a moment to reflect on the act of reading this article. As you scroll down the page, the website's owners are watching – and collecting data. How much time are you spending on the article? Once you finish, what essay or website will you visit next? Finally, your internet service provider (ISP) wants to make sure that it too can gobble up personal information as you download movies or stream music. Contrary to its name, however, it is unbelievably important. In fact, it's making Corporate America very rich. For companies – especially advertisers – this personal information is a gold mine, unlike anything they've ever seen. Before the tech revolution, they had to guess about consumers in America, mostly by looking at credit card purchases. Think ""soccer moms"" and ""yoga dads."" With your digital exhaust, however, they have a very real person. A very specific person. They have you. But here's the kicker: You're also paying for the pleasure of giving it away. You purchase your cellphone or laptop, your internet connection, and (sometimes) a subscription to the very websites collecting your data. If this strikes you as unfair – not being paid at a time of stagnate  wages, student  debt, and an inability to buy your first home – it should. Unfortunately, though, it's about to get a lot worse. Consider the recently announced Samsung Family Hub  refrigerator. Open its doors and inside you'll find cameras that monitor food consumption and expiration dates. Out of mayo? Not to worry. This fridge is connected to Amazon, which will send you fresh supplies as needed. Admittedly, this convenience sounds pretty cool. But pause for a moment and remember: You will spend over $5,000 to purchase this fridge, pay Amazon for the groceries, and cut a check each month for internet service. You get none of it. Companies know that these types of gadgets – all together called the  Internet of Things (IoT) – are the future of our global economy. That's why they're connecting every consumer good you can imagine –  clothing, toothbrushes,  toilets – to the internet. The massive amounts of data exhaust you create will result in billions or more in profit. The winners in this lopsided exchange are obvious. Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos will use IoT devices to increase his  fortune far beyond its current $70 billion. Meanwhile, the losers – you and I – will continue to believe that their economic value is limited to ""doing"" something for eight hours a day. That is, unless we find a way to fight back. There are different solutions being considered but I've focused on one in particular:  data mining royalties. In the world of resource extraction (oil, natural gas, and minerals), landowners are long accustomed to getting paid a royalty when their property is mined. Companies like Shell and ExxonMobil pay farmers, ranchers, and governments each time they remove a barrel of oil or ounce of gold. The reason for the exchange is clear: when someone takes, they have to pay. That's how healthy capitalism works. Data mining companies, however, are playing by a different set of rules. They are extracting a resource – your data – and selling it for billions without paying you a dime. Meanwhile, some are even charging you for the mining equipment with every new device you buy, paid website you visit, or ISP you use. If, however, we were to levy a royalty each time data companies extracted or sold your information, we could ensure that you are adequately compensated for the value you create. The particulars of this approach are still in the design phase – research partners are needed – but the concept is sound. If you get mined, you get paid. And that is how we ought to answer the question raging in Congress. Who in America should profit from the tech revolution? You. Not Big Data.

413,Nick Wells,4132017,CNBC,4062017,"Officials at the Federal Reserve want to start winding down the massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet the central bank has built up. The news came Wednesday when minutes from the Federal Open Markets Committee's March meeting were released. During that meeting, the members of the committee voted to raise the federal funds rate a quarter of a point, the third such hike since the financial crisis. The Fed built up the behemoth balance sheet over the past decade through several rounds of quantitative easing, buying up bonds and mortgage-backed securities and has been discussing how to wind it down. When you're talking about numbers that high, things get out of perspective. We thought we'd help out and show you what $4.5 trillion could buy. For one thing, the Fed could buy up most of the companies in the S&P 500. A full 315 individual companies, when counting from the bottom of the list by market capitalization. That includes well-known names like Viacom, Clorox and Expedia. On the other end, the Fed's spending spree could purchase the top 10 companies: everything from Apple to Wells Fargo. That includes a lot of big outfits like Amazon, Alphabet and Exxon Mobil. But the Fed maybe should have wound down its balance sheet years ago: A previous CNBC analysis showed that in December 2015, it could have afforded the 14 biggest companies in the index.

In terms of sales, the Fed's assets are worth about nine times the annual sales of Wal-Mart, which led the S&P 500 last year.

415,"Travis Hoium, Brian Feroldi, Chuck Saletta, Dan Caplinger, and John Rosevear",4132017,Fool,4062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In a market with low interest rates, it can be hard to find steady long-term cash flows. For those looking for the cash flow of high dividend yield stocks, there are some good options if you know where to look. Five of our contributors picked their favorite high yield dividends and explain why you may want to put Cedar Fair, L.P. (NYSE:FUN), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MPW), Pattern Energy Group Inc (NASDAQ:PEGI), and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) on your list. Image source: Getty Images. Travis Hoium (Pattern Energy): The yieldco market has taken a beating over the last year, but it's still built for the long haul. For instance, Pattern Energy has 2,644 MW of renewable energy projects, most of which have contracts to sell energy to a utility or large corporate customer for over a decade. This gives long-term cash flows to pay dividends. And Pattern Energy's dividend currently stands at a 8.2% yield. What Pattern Energy plans to do long-term is issue more equity and project debt to fund more acquisitions. And if returns are right it can do that, although it would be tough to accretively buy projects with an 8.2% dividend yield. If the stock doesn't rise, the alternative is that management just pays out excess cash flow as a dividend and investors make a return off the payout. This creates a situation where the best case scenario is that you buy a stock that pays a strong dividend, the stock rises, and higher stock price leads to more dividend growth -- rinse and repeat. The worst case scenario is that you just collect the current dividend for 15-20 years. The rate of return on just collecting the current dividend for 20 years with no growth in stock value at the end of that time is 5.3%, better than owning treasuries. That's not bad for what should be the company's worst case scenario. Image source: Getty Images. Brian Feroldi (Cedar Fair): Building an amusement park from scratch requires hundreds of millions of dollars and years of development time, not to mention a boatload of government permits. These realities make getting into this business incredibly difficult, which is wonderful news for established players. In fact, the limited competition provides existing parks with monopoly-like status in the regions where they operate, which leads to pricing power. Cedar Fair is a publically traded amusement park operator that has greatly benefited from these industry dynamics. The company owns 11 popular amusement parks are spread across the U.S. and have proven to be quite popular. In fact, last year the company welcomed more than 25 million visitors, which was a new record. Looking ahead, Cedar Fair has a number of initiatives in place that should allow the company's financial statements to flourish. Beyond introducing new rides, the company is rolling out limited-time events in the off season that are designed to increase visits and encourage season pass ticket sales. When combined with modest price increases, Cedar Fair looks well positioned for steady top-line growth in the years ahead. Cedar Fair is structured as a master limited partnership, or MLP, so it is required to pass on the majority of its profits to investors in the form of dividend payments. The stock currently yields 5%, which is an attractive rate for such a company with such strong assets. Before you jump in, you should know that buying an MLP like Cedar Fair means that you will have to fill out some extra paperwork at tax time. If you're OK with that small clerical hassle, then I think Cedar Fair is a terrific high-yield stock to consider. Chuck Saletta (Medical Properties Trust): Health care is an industry that's hard to offshore and that people will use no matter what the economy is doing to their incomes. That makes Medical Properties Trust an intriguing high yield investment: it's a Real Estate Investment Trust that owns and leases out properties that serve the healthcare industry. Medical Property Trust currently sports a yield above 7.4%, and it has been slowly restoring its dividend since cutting it during last decade's financial crisis. As a REIT, Medical Properties Trust must pay out at least 90% of its income as a shareholder distribution, but like many REITs, its distribution actually exceeds its accounting income. Despite that high payout on an earnings basis, Medical Properties Trust's dividend is covered by its operating cash flows and funds from operations. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the real estate business, the company reports around $96 million in non-cash depreciation expenses, explaining why net income is so far below those other measures. Further supporting the company's ability to pay those distributions, Medical Property Trust has only moderate levels of leverage on its balance sheet. Its debt to equity ratio is around 0.9, and it has a current ratio above 5, showcasing its solid financial foundation. So not only is its distribution covered by its operations, it looks to be in a solid enough financial position so that its distribution doesn't look like it's at near term risk due to financing concerns. While the Medical Properties Trust's dividend looks supportable, there's no guarantee that its share price will remain stable. As interest rates rise, bonds will become more attractive for income seekers, putting pressure on the prices of high yielding stocks like this one. Still, if you're looking for current income from your investments and are OK with that potential volatility, Medical Properties Trust certainly looks like it's worth considering. John Rosevear (General Motors): We all know that self-driving cars and new tech-enabled forms of personal mobility are going to disrupt and transform the auto business as we've known it for many years. So why am I suggesting you buy General Motors -- of all companies! -- right now? Two big reasons: Lots of automakers are talking about their visions of ""mobility"" right now -- concepts like ride-hailing and car-sharing that will be enabled by the advent of highly interconnected self-driving electric vehicles. For most automakers, that's still mostly talk. But under CEO Mary Barra, GM has been taking action: That electric car, the Chevy Bolt, is the key to GM's future vision in ways that investors haven't yet realized. The Bolt is the foundation -- the ""platform"", as GM insiders say -- for the electric self-driving summoned-by-smartphone-app car service that all those other automakers and tech experts are talking about as some future thing that might arrive next decade. But GM's shipping it today. Soon, according to reports that GM pointedly isn't denying, GM and Lyft will roll out thousands of Bolts equipped with a prototype Level 4 self-driving system. Those Bolts will go into service with Lyft and gather the data needed to turn that prototype system into a production-ready one -- and do it sooner than most expect. That's the future everyone is talking about, and GM is making it happen right in front of us. The market hasn't quite caught on yet, and that means there's an opportunity. Dan Caplinger (ExxonMobil): The energy industry has been a hotbed of dividend income lately, but you have to choose high-quality stocks in order to feel confident about their ability to sustain and grow those quarterly payouts over time. ExxonMobil is a logical choice for those investors seeking stocks with unquestionable blue-chip status, given its position atop the industry and the breadth of its integrated oil and gas operations. With operations across the globe and plenty of growth prospects, ExxonMobil has been able to make it through tough industry conditions without the disruptions that smaller players have seen. ExxonMobil currently yields 3.7%, and it also has an impressive track record of annual dividend increases that stretches back for 34 years. Traditionally, Exxon tends to boost its quarterly payouts toward the end of April or the beginning of May, and it's reasonable to expect that trend to continue this year. Given last year's modest increase of just 3%, ExxonMobil probably won't reward investors with a huge hike in 2017. But over the long run, dividend growth has been extensive, and the fact that Exxon hasn't seen a big move higher over the past year suggests that a rebound could still be in the cards for the oil and gas giant.

                                   to scrappier exploration and production outfits, companies have raced to the Permian Basin, an area roughly 250 miles wide by 300 miles long located mostly in West Texas. Mergers and acquisitions involving the Permian are worth $17 billion so far this year, including corporate acquisitions and asset buys, according to IHS Markit. That compares with nearly $26 billion in the area’s transactions for all of 2016 and $11 billion in 2012. Permian deals are worth 76% of the total value of oil and gas exploration deals in the U.S. in 2017; that share was 41% in 2016 and 13% in 2012 “The interest you see in the Permian is legitimate,” said Ganesh Jois, a fund manager with Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s energy and infrastructure team. “There’s no doubt that there’s tremendous resources there.” The bigger question, however, is whether oil futures prices will cooperate, he said. Read more: Chevron’s road back to profitability goes through Texas’ Permian Basin Most companies in the Permian forecast 15% to 20% production growth for this year, a pace that assumes oil futures prices around $50 to $55 a barrel. Prices below $45 a barrel, however, could crimp production. As more companies move to the Permian, land prices have risen. According to IHS Markit, the average acre in the Permian sold for about $6,000 in 2012, while one acre sold for more than $29,000 last year and these days is worth some $22,000, although it is hard to speak of averages as prices vary according to underlying, potential value that the land is perceived to hold. Early last year, one acre might have sold for $30,000 or $35,000; by the fall of 2016, one acre was going for about $45,000, GSAM’s Jois said. “In the past 15 months or so, we’ve seen a bit of a land grab.” Even as prices drifted lower, interest in the Permian was sustained, which helped it gain its notoriety. That’s because the Permian benefits from being a long-established oil-producing region. “It’s a mature region with a lot of infrastructure,” said Deborah Byers, a managing partner and U.S. oil and gas leader at consultancy EY, formerly Ernst & Young. “There’s 90 years of history there.” That precious infrastructure supports exploration and connects production to major markets, a web of support that newer oil plays may lack and one that keeps costs relatively low, keeping the Permian attractive amid lower futures prices. See also:  Texas’ Permian Basin is only U.S. oil-producing region where production will rise Oil majors mostly left the Permian and other inland U.S. areas two decades ago to pursue deepwater exploration off the Gulf of Mexico, leaving smaller independent companies to continue to coax oil and gas from the area. New uses of technology, a better understanding of geology, and geopolitical forces have made the Permian a renewed success, and the majors are coming back.

                                    $2.8 billion deal with Double Eagle Energy Inc. assets. When oil prices are weaker, the Permian is one of the few places where it remains economical to drill, said Sven del Pozzo, an equity analyst with IHS Markit. The path to understanding the Permian’s lasting allure amid oil prices’ wild ride in the past two and a half years starts at understanding its stacked “pay zones.” A pay zone is a pocket that contains oil and gas that are economically and technically feasible to produce. In the Permian, there is no single pay zone, instead there are several, stacked like giant rock pancakes. Related: Lower profits for energy companies dampen hopes for sector recovery Embedded in those multilayered stacks, there’s “tight oil,” and extracting the oil and gas trapped in that geological quirk has become more economically feasible in the last few decades, with evolving strategies that combine horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Horizontal drilling is particularly efficient in the Permian and other “tight oil” formations. That’s drilling a well sideways rather than straight down, and in the process exposing more oil-rich rock to the well bore than what would be exposed by drilling a conventional vertical well. For an investor, Jois said he and his colleagues are more optimistic about infrastructure companies than producers. If the 15% to 20% growth that exploration and production companies are expecting comes to pass, it would bode well for the so-called “midstream” companies, such as pipeline operators and natural-gas liquids processors, he said. In going for such companies, investors are not taking on direct oil-price risk, he said. For the Permian in particular, there’s a “fair amount” of natural gas that needs to be processed, stored, and transported, Jois said. Gas processing may be the area that will experience the most growth in the Permian, as more oil-pipeline capacity is coming on line, he said. Among large natural-gas midstream companies with a presence in the Permian are Energy Transfer Partners LP

It manages its operations through four segments: asphalt terminaling services, crude oil terminaling and storage services, crude oil pipeline services, and crude oil trucking and producer field services. Asphalt terminaling services Asphalt terminaling services segment operations generally consist of fee based activities associated with providing storage, terminaling and throughput services for asphalt product and residual fuel oil. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's 54 asphalt terminals were located in 26 states and are positioned to provide asphalt terminaling services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. As of December 31, 2016, with approximately 9.6 million barrels of total asphalt product and residual fuel oil storage capacity, the Company was focused on providing its customers the ability to manage their asphalt product storage and processing and marketing activities. The Company has storage contracts or leases with customers for all of its asphalt facilities. Crude oil terminaling and storage Crude oil terminaling and storage segment operations generally consist of fee based activities associated with providing storage, terminaling, and throughput services for crude oil. The Company provides crude oil terminaling and storage services at its terminaling and storage facilities located in Oklahoma and Texas. It owned and operated an aggregate of approximately 7.4 million barrels of storage capacity, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, of this storage capacity, approximately 6.6 million barrels were located at its terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Its Cushing terminal is located within the Cushing Interchange, a crude oil marketing hub in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in all New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil futures contracts. Its terminals had a combined capacity to receive or deliver approximately 10 million barrels of crude oil per month, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, it also owned approximately 50 acres of additional land within the Cushing Interchange, where it can develop additional storage capacity.

418, ,4202017,Investopedia,4132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The biggest difference between a 401(k) plan and a traditional pension plan is the distinction between a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan. Defined benefit plans, such as pensions, guarantee a given amount of monthly income in retirement and place the investment risk on the plan provider. Defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, allow individual employees to choose their own retirement investments with no guaranteed minimum or maximum benefits. Employees assume investment risks in defined contribution plans. There are other differences as well, including the availability of each plan. Your employer is much more likely to offer a 401(k) plan than a pension plan in its benefits package. Pensions have become less popular with the rise of defined contribution plans. This is because pensions are both more expensive and more risky to employers than a 401(k) plan. 401(k) plans also allow smaller employers, which otherwise might not have had the money to set up a pension plan, to provide retirement benefits to prospective workers. It is much easier to move and keep contributing to 401(k) funds if you switch jobs or if your company goes through a merger. Pensions, on the other hand, are better designed for employees who stay with the same company for many years. A 401(k) is primarily funded through employee contributions via pre-tax paycheck deductions. Contributed money can be placed into various investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), depending on what options are made available through the plan. Any investment growth in a 401(k) occurs tax free, and there is no cap on the growth of an individual 401(k) account. The major drawback of 401(k)s is that there is no floor, either. 401(k)s can lose value if the underlying portfolio performs poorly. There is a greater risk/return tradeoff with 401(k) plans. Many employers offer match programs with their 401(k) plans, meaning they contribute additional money to an employee account (up to a certain level) whenever the employee makes his own contributions. For example, assume that your employer offers a 50% match of your individual contributions to your 401(k) up to 6% of your salary. You earn $100,000 and contribute $6,000 (6%) to your 401(k), so your employer contributes an additional $3,000 to your 401(k). Employees do not have control of investment decisions with a pension plan. Rather, contributions are made, either by the employer or by the employee, to an investment portfolio that is completely controlled by the company. The company, in turn, promises to provide a certain monthly income to retired employees based on the amount contributed and, often, the number of years spent working for the company. The guaranteed income comes with a caveat: If the company's portfolio performs poorly, the company declares bankruptcy or faces other problems, it is possible that benefits are reduced. Nevertheless, pension plans present individual employees with significantly less market risk than 401(k) plans. In exchange, 401(k) plans offer more flexibility and control. The pension plans are typically financed by the employers and guarantee an individual pension when the employee retires. The guaranteed pension will depend on the years of service, seniority, and earned income among other factors. Employees may or may not be required to contribute to the pension plan. The crucial element here is the guaranteed amount. The employers bear the risk of meeting their future obligations. As we have seen many times already, many employers have a shortfall in their pension plans and have to take money out of their operation to pay off pensions to their former workers. The 401k and 403b are defined contributions plans, where both the employee and the employer make contributions. These contributions are tax deferred. They reduce taxes in the year they are made. Taxes are due upon withdrawal of funds. The main burden in these plans falls onto the worker. They are responsible for making contributions to their retirement plans. The employees are also responsible for making investment choices and choosing the asset allocation for the account. The employers do no guarantee a fixed pension. The retirement distributions are solely dependent on the contribution amounts and the performance of the funds chosen in the plan. Hello, In the simplest term, a 401(k) is the money you have to fund for your retirement, whereas a pension is solely funded by your employer. Picture this; after 35-years working for a company, if you have a 401(k) account, you would have a lump-sum money at your retirement, say $600K. Now you have to decide how you can make that $600K last for you and your spouse’s lifetime. It’s not an easy task. Invest too aggressive, you may have unpredictable cash flow, sometimes may be high, other times may be low. Invest too conservative, you may lose money to inflation. On the other hand, with the lump-sum amount of money at the retirement, you have the flexibility to prioritize the spending, such as paying off the residue mortgage, taking a luxury vacation, etc. Instead of taxing your brain for how best to utilize and preserve your money from the 401(k), your employer takes that burden off you and hires an actuary to think ahead for you. They calculate a monthly payment and pay you and/or your spouse for a lifetime. In a way, it’s like you take a permanent vacation from your employer, never returning to work, but still enjoying a lifetime paycheck. However, the price to pay that peace of mind is you lose the control of the money. You may still have to budget and save up for a vacation or expenditures. Hopefully, this simple illustration explains the main difference of the two retirement payment methods. Best! By classical definition, a 401(k) plan is a ""Contribution Plan"" where the contribution is defined. The employee withholds off of his paycheck and the employer may or may not match. Additionally, a Profit Sharing Plan is a type of 401(k) plan where the company puts in monies based upon ""profits"" in any given year. But in any kind of 401(k), the contribution is defined, not the benefit. A pension plan is a ""Defined Benefit Plan"" where the benefit on the backend at retirement is defined. The company makes contributions, not the employee, and is based on salary, years of service, etc. The benefit is normally a percentage of salary. You then can receive a monthly income stream for life. Many defined benefit or pension plans allow you to roll out your lump sum into an IRA rollover so you can control, but then you are responsible.

All the same, the benefits can be huge for the select people who these plans really fit for.  Ideally high earning small business owners, with few employees.  Essentially a Defined Benefit Plan is a way to put more away for business owners retirement with a tax deduction on contribution, and tax deferred growth.  On the other hand if you are an employee with a pension plan through your employer, and not really have much say in how it is managed, or invested. You do have a say on how you take distributions from the plan, but that’s it.  401(k) Plans or Profit Sharing Plans 401(K) are the most common for private sector employees.  Much like a Traditional IRA your contributions are tax deductible, and your investments will accumulate on a tax deferred basics.  Again you should leave you money in the account until you are 59 1/2.  Withdrawals will be subject to ordinary income taxes.  Plus that pesky 10% penalty for early withdrawals (pre 59 ½).  There will also be required minimum distributions from 401(K) plans starting at 70 ½.

In 2017 you can contribute up to $18,000 per year to a 401(K) plan.  If you are 50 years wise or more you can also make a “catch-up” contribution of up to $6,000.  Meaning a potential $24,000 contribution per year each.  To make this even better your employer may match some of your contributions, and/or offer a profit sharing contribution. You can potentially have combined contributions (employee, employer, and any profit sharing) of $54,000 per year.  That jumps to $60,000 per year if you have reached 50 years old (2017 numbers).  There will often be a vesting schedule for the employer contribution, meaning if you leave your job within a certain period of time you will forfeit some of the matching or profit sharing contributions.  With that in mind be aware of when you give notice, you don’t want to quit one day before another vesting deadline. (This may sound obvious but I guarantee you most people forget about this when they overwhelmed with the excitement of their next job.) Depending on how you look at it a big benefit or big drawback of a 401(K) plan is the limited investment options.  You may get stuck with some crappy investment options, or the plan may not have a great array of choices.   For some the limited choices may make getting started easier, other may grumble about being limited to a select group of investments, or not being able to utilize their favorite investment selections. In the grand scheme of things I’m pretty ambivalent on this point, I’d rather get a generous company match and good investment options, than amazing options with no match, or the lower contribution limits of a traditional IRA. Some 401(K) plans do offer loan provision – but don’t mortgage your future.  Ignore this option, and don’t touch your retirement savings. Your older self will thank you.   Also if you take a loan, and then leave your job, you will most likely end up with a large tax hit, as the rest of the loan become taxable income, with that pesky 10% IRS penalty (if you are under 59 ½) that we mentioned above.

419, ,4202017,Investopedia,4132017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The biggest difference between a 401(k) plan and a traditional pension plan is the distinction between a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan. Defined benefit plans, such as pensions, guarantee a given amount of monthly income in retirement and place the investment risk on the plan provider. Defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s, allow individual employees to choose their own retirement investments with no guaranteed minimum or maximum benefits. Employees assume investment risks in defined contribution plans. There are other differences as well, including the availability of each plan. Your employer is much more likely to offer a 401(k) plan than a pension plan in its benefits package. Pensions have become less popular with the rise of defined contribution plans. This is because pensions are both more expensive and more risky to employers than a 401(k) plan. 401(k) plans also allow smaller employers, which otherwise might not have had the money to set up a pension plan, to provide retirement benefits to prospective workers. It is much easier to move and keep contributing to 401(k) funds if you switch jobs or if your company goes through a merger. Pensions, on the other hand, are better designed for employees who stay with the same company for many years. A 401(k) is primarily funded through employee contributions via pre-tax paycheck deductions. Contributed money can be placed into various investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), depending on what options are made available through the plan. Any investment growth in a 401(k) occurs tax free, and there is no cap on the growth of an individual 401(k) account. The major drawback of 401(k)s is that there is no floor, either. 401(k)s can lose value if the underlying portfolio performs poorly. There is a greater risk/return tradeoff with 401(k) plans. Many employers offer match programs with their 401(k) plans, meaning they contribute additional money to an employee account (up to a certain level) whenever the employee makes his own contributions. For example, assume that your employer offers a 50% match of your individual contributions to your 401(k) up to 6% of your salary. You earn $100,000 and contribute $6,000 (6%) to your 401(k), so your employer contributes an additional $3,000 to your 401(k). Employees do not have control of investment decisions with a pension plan. Rather, contributions are made, either by the employer or by the employee, to an investment portfolio that is completely controlled by the company. The company, in turn, promises to provide a certain monthly income to retired employees based on the amount contributed and, often, the number of years spent working for the company. The guaranteed income comes with a caveat: If the company's portfolio performs poorly, the company declares bankruptcy or faces other problems, it is possible that benefits are reduced. Nevertheless, pension plans present individual employees with significantly less market risk than 401(k) plans. In exchange, 401(k) plans offer more flexibility and control. The pension plans are typically financed by the employers and guarantee an individual pension when the employee retires. The guaranteed pension will depend on the years of service, seniority, and earned income among other factors. Employees may or may not be required to contribute to the pension plan. The crucial element here is the guaranteed amount. The employers bear the risk of meeting their future obligations. As we have seen many times already, many employers have a shortfall in their pension plans and have to take money out of their operation to pay off pensions to their former workers. The 401k and 403b are defined contributions plans, where both the employee and the employer make contributions. These contributions are tax deferred. They reduce taxes in the year they are made. Taxes are due upon withdrawal of funds. The main burden in these plans falls onto the worker. They are responsible for making contributions to their retirement plans. The employees are also responsible for making investment choices and choosing the asset allocation for the account. The employers do no guarantee a fixed pension. The retirement distributions are solely dependent on the contribution amounts and the performance of the funds chosen in the plan. Hello, In the simplest term, a 401(k) is the money you have to fund for your retirement, whereas a pension is solely funded by your employer. Picture this; after 35-years working for a company, if you have a 401(k) account, you would have a lump-sum money at your retirement, say $600K. Now you have to decide how you can make that $600K last for you and your spouse’s lifetime. It’s not an easy task. Invest too aggressive, you may have unpredictable cash flow, sometimes may be high, other times may be low. Invest too conservative, you may lose money to inflation. On the other hand, with the lump-sum amount of money at the retirement, you have the flexibility to prioritize the spending, such as paying off the residue mortgage, taking a luxury vacation, etc. Instead of taxing your brain for how best to utilize and preserve your money from the 401(k), your employer takes that burden off you and hires an actuary to think ahead for you. They calculate a monthly payment and pay you and/or your spouse for a lifetime. In a way, it’s like you take a permanent vacation from your employer, never returning to work, but still enjoying a lifetime paycheck. However, the price to pay that peace of mind is you lose the control of the money. You may still have to budget and save up for a vacation or expenditures. Hopefully, this simple illustration explains the main difference of the two retirement payment methods. Best! By classical definition, a 401(k) plan is a ""Contribution Plan"" where the contribution is defined. The employee withholds off of his paycheck and the employer may or may not match. Additionally, a Profit Sharing Plan is a type of 401(k) plan where the company puts in monies based upon ""profits"" in any given year. But in any kind of 401(k), the contribution is defined, not the benefit. A pension plan is a ""Defined Benefit Plan"" where the benefit on the backend at retirement is defined. The company makes contributions, not the employee, and is based on salary, years of service, etc. The benefit is normally a percentage of salary. You then can receive a monthly income stream for life. Many defined benefit or pension plans allow you to roll out your lump sum into an IRA rollover so you can control, but then you are responsible. This is an oversimplification, but I didn't want to get into the minutiae.

421,"Constance Gustke, special to CNBC.com",4202017,CNBC,4132017,"The first 100 days of President Donald J. Trump's term are on track to work out pretty well for stocks. That's better than modern White House history would suggest. Stocks have not done that well at the outset of new presidential terms. When the market has done well, it's been more often for the Democrats. So while the Trump presidency has produced some big missteps — and disappointments for Trump supporters — barring a major meltdown in the next two weeks, the first 100 days are on track for sizable gains for the market. Even after posting negative returns in the past month, the primary S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is up 2.9 percent since Jan. 20, and the primary Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) is up by 3.6 percent, according to Morningstar. The primary Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ), meanwhile, has been the best, with a return of 6 percent. The 45th U.S. president still has his work cut out for him if he wants to match a nemesis: The S&P 500 posted positive performance during the first 100 days of both of President Barack Obama's terms in office. Going back as far as the Eisenhower years, Democratic administrations have had much stronger stock markets at the beginning of new terms, according to CFRA data. The data on presidents and markets is clearly not statistically significant — it's about as small as a sample gets. And the torrid pace set by stocks directly after Trump's win on Nov. 8 complicated market pricing efforts. So the first 100 days' data is probably best considered as something between a sound bite and data point in the final analysis. But it's worth reviewing what has been expected and what has been surprising about the direction in the stock market during Trump's first 100 days, especially at the sector level. Energy had outshone nearly every sector during the early days of the past five presidential administrations. And when presidents are more energy-centric than others, it has helped. Not in Trump's case. While energy stocks rose 11.4 percent in the first 14 weeks of President Bush's new administration in 2001, and 11.3 percent in 2005, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) is down more than 6 percent since Jan. 20. Trump's administration still looks to be positive for energy — especially traditional sources, including oil and gas. But oil prices — after a big recovery in 2016 — have been the culprit in a falloff for the sector. For investors who think the sector is attractive, CFRA recommends XLE as the broadest way to catch any energy gains. It invests more than 46 percent of assets in what Morningstar classifies as ""giant"" stocks, including global oil players like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The fund is low-cost and highly liquid. ""If you are a believer in patterns based on past performance, then diversified sector ETFs are a good way to get exposure,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Vanguard Energy (VDE) is another broad energy ETF featuring the same top three oil stocks, but assets are also diversified among exploration companies.

Investing like Buffet without even knowing it
The Trump trade is now second fiddle in the world Given that Trump wants to drill for more oil, the iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF (IEO) could still be a beneficiary of the new administration. It includes more U.S.-focused drillers, like ConocoPhillips and EOG Resources, as well as refining plays like Phillips 66. Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, said the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) is similar to IEO, with a mix between exploration stocks and refining stocks that is about 75 percent to 80 percent/15 percent to 20 percent, but it has lots of smaller-cap stocks, so it's more volatile. XOP has near-30 percent of its holdings in small-cap names, while for IOE the percentage of exposure to small-cap stocks is under 10 percent. The price-to-earnings ratio of IEO is 17.43; for XOP the P/E ratio is 25. Five of XOP's top 10 holdings have a market cap of roughly $5 billion or below, including Chesapeake Energy, currently its largest holding. None of IEO's top 10 holding have a market cap less than roughly $19 billion. The materials sector — which includes chemicals, paper and mining — has been another of the more consistent sector winners in recent history of new administrations. Materials stocks were strong performers in 2016, too. Rosenbluth pointed to the broad materials ETF that represents the S&P 500 materials subsector, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB). Its main holdings include high-profile merger targets Dow Chemical, DuPont and Monsanto. ""Company consolidation is taking place and driving prices higher,"" he said. And it has done OK, though the sector has trailed the broader market, up close to 1.3 percent since Jan. 20, according to Morningstar. The smaller, SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME) mainly owns steel companies, like U.S. Steel, ripped after Trump's election, but since he actually assumed office, it has declined by near-9 percent. U.S. Steel is down 13 percent since Jan. 20 — though its near-50 percent gain in the past year still looks good. ""It could be a beneficiary of increased steel demand from U.S. companies,"" Rosenbluth said. Mishra also likes the smaller, Van Eck Vectors Steel (SLX), which has international holdings like Rio Tinto. ""Trump is talking about building infrastructure,"" she said, ""so materials companies will do well."" It is also down more than 9 percent since Jan. 20. Technology has historically lagged other sectors at the beginning of new term — with Obama's first term as an exception. Many pundits expected tech to trail under Trump as a global manufacturing and trade war rattled supply chains. That hasn't happened — Trump has even toned down talk about NAFTA revisions and did not follow through on campaign rhetoric calling China a currency manipulator. Trump did make overtures to tech CEOs under the guidance of his Silicon Valley backer, venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Technology stocks would also benefit if corporate profits held offshore, were allowed to be brought back to the U.S. on a preferential tax basis. Many big technology companies are big dividend payers. That would help explain tech stocks being up so much since Jan. 20, though there are indications tax reform will take longer than initially expected. The Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) has generated a return of more than 6 percent since Trump took office, according to Morningstar. Its biggest holdings include stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which are among the tech companies that have had rising dividend payouts. Market analysts were more positive on health care after Trump's win because Hillary Clinton had been more vocal about drug pricing. While Trump made plenty of comments about drug costs and at his first press conference in six months, on Jan. 11, the then-president-elect even said drug companies have been getting away with murder, investors haven't been fazed. As for Obamacare and the health sector, also lots of talk and a major Trump failure, but little negative effect on stocks. The Health Care SPDR (XLV) is also up near 6 percent since Jan. 20. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist for SunTrust, said health care will continue to be faced with headline risk that can result in price swings for the sector, but he pointed out that health care was the worst performing sector in 2016. He thinks any additional headline risks will create opportunities to buy on the dip. He is also favoring large-cap biotech, which came into Trump's term trading at its largest discount to the broad-based market — on a price-to-earnings basis — in the past 20 years.

422,Andrew Tonner,4202017,Fool,4132017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The showdown between Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is a veritable clash of retail titans. A perennial leader among the Fortune 500, Wal-Mart consistently generates the most revenue on planet Earth -- among publicly traded companies, at least. In fact, Wal-Mart's $482 billion in sales last year more than doubles the second-largest corporate giant on the list, ExxonMobil. However, Amazon has combined Wal-Mart's appetite for low prices with its uniquely innovative ability to become the retail giant for the digital age. So, which is the better stock to own today: Amazon or Wal-Mart? In this article, both Amazon and Wal-Mart will go through a three-part analysis to get a better sense of which appears to be the better buy today. Each with large finance departments, investors can safely assume that Amazon's and Wal-Mart's current capital structures are in place for a reason. To frame this discussions, here's a cursory snapshot into several of the most important liquidity and solvency metrics for each company. Data sources: Amazon.com and Wal-Mart investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Figures from Amazon's and Wal-Mart's FY 2016 10-K. Cash from Ops reflects the last 12 months reported. Amazon's $18.2 billion positive net-cash balance clearly jumps out as markedly better than Wal-Mart's negative $36.9 billion in net debt. However, this isn't nearly as glaring an impediment as it might first appear thanks to Wal-Mart's gargantuan operating cash flow, which is roughly twice that of Amazon's. This narrows the difference between the two companies in my eyes, and the difference between their current ratio is negligible enough to not really factor into the discussion. More importantly, both companies are well managed enough to the point they should be able to meet any and all financial obligations while also tapping credit markets to finance any interesting opportunities. That being said, Amazon's slightly more conservative financial structure earns it a win in this analysis of financial strength. Though of course important differences exist between the two, Wal-Mart and Amazon are more similar to one another than they are different today. Wal-Mart is the world's largest retailer -- total sales topped $481 billion last year -- and its entire business revolves around selling all manner of goods to consumers worldwide. Amazon's business mix is only slightly more eclectic. Its AWS reporting segment accounted for about $12.2 billion (9%) of overall sales. The remaining $123 billion (91%) of Amazon's total sales largely reflect its e-commerce operations, although sales of quasi-retail services like its Prime free shipping and online streaming platform are included in that number. The core difference between the two is the method of distribution. Wal-Mart is largely reliant on its brick-and-mortar network of over 11,695 stores, whereas Amazon's sales occur entirely online. Of the two, Amazon is far better aligned with the long-term trends taking place within the retail sector, and Wal-Mart finds itself moving as quickly as possible to catch up with Amazon in this regard. Image source: Getty Images. Wal-Mart remains far behind Amazon, though, in developing its e-commerce capabilities. Case in point: Amazon captured 38% of U.S. e-commerce sales during the 2016 holiday season, compared to just 2.6% for Wal-Mart, according to researcher Slice Intelligence. Wal-Mart has intensified its efforts to narrow the gap with Amazon, mostly notably through its acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com last year. The steep $3.3 billion price was largely seen as an ""acqu-hire"" of Jet's CEO Marc Lore, one of the few to successfully compete head-to-head against Amazon with diapers.com, which Amazon eventually acquired in 2011 after trying to kill the company in a bare-knuckled price war. All of this is to say that Amazon is currently beating Wal-Mart in the all-important e-commerce space. However, Wal-Mart has finally gotten serious and paid-up for the talent required to bring its own sales model into the 21st century. Given Wal-Mart's unmatched leverage with suppliers, the most likely outcome of the e-commerce arms race is that Amazon and Wal-Mart will end this generational growth story roughly as equals. Turning to their valuations, the multiples perfectly capture the difference in investor sentiment between Amazon and Wal-Mart. Here's a quick snapshot of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for Amazon and Wal-Mart. Data sources: Amazon.com and Wal-Mart investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Clearly, Amazon is likely to grow far faster than Wal-Mart in the coming years. However, with Wal-Mart's recent moves to narrow the talent gap between itself and Amazon -- the precursor to narrowing the actual business gap -- Wal-Mart's shares look far more compelling from a purely dollars-and-cents perspective. This one is pretty straightforward, although I like both companies' shares, for the record. All of this is to say that both Wal-Mart and Amazon are dominant, world-class companies. By way of metaphor, Amazon is the barbarian at the gate, storming the gates of an industry that Wal-Mart has dominated without equal for years. And even though Wal-Mart has finally gotten serious about e-commerce as well, Amazon's incredible ability to develop unique solutions to capture an ever greater share of the e-commerce world gives it a slight edge over Wal-Mart. Different stocks for companies at different stages of their corporate lifecycles, I like Amazon shares a bit more in this showdown of e-commerce titans. ","

We are all David Dao, because anyone who has flown knows exactly what it’s like to be treated like luggage. Still, the out-of-proportion outrage seems a little unfair to United, which, after all, isn’t the only airline with terrible service and bad manners. And it certainly isn’t the worst corporation in the world. In fairness, then, to United, here’s a reminder of five corporations that really deserve our scorn. (Feel free to add examples in the comments of companies that you think I should have included.) ExxonMobil for leading the way on denying global warming. The largest oil company in the world has known since at least the 1970s that the widespread burning of fossil fuels is a major contributor to global warming. Yet, for decades, the company fought all efforts to stop global warming.

As a result, America is the only country in the world where a significant number of people deny the danger. Exxon has changed its tune, a little. The company now says that global warming is real and is caused largely by humans, but the oil giant still sees a large and continuing role for fossil fuels.

Park shook down South Korean corporations for money, and Samsung was eager to comply in exchange for approval for its $8 billion merger of two Samsung affiliates, according to the parliamentary investigation that led to Park’s impeachment. Samsung, which accounts for one-fifth of Korean exports, has been embroiled in bribery scandals numerous times in the past. Lee’s father, Chairman Lee Kun-hee, has been convicted on bribery and tax-evasion charges twice, but was pardoned and has never served a day in jail. Purdue Pharma for dealing deadly drugs. More than 50,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2015, and the deadliest drug epidemic in U.S. history only got worse in 2016, preliminary data show. Most of the overdoses were linked to opioids, such as the prescription painkillers sold as Percocet and OxyContin. Privately owned Purdue Pharma makes OxyContin and other opioid painkillers. More importantly, Purdue was at the forefront of marketing painkillers to government regulators, doctors, pharmacists and patients. In 2007, a division of the company agreed to pay a $600 million fine for deceptively selling the drug for off-label uses. In other words, Purdue lied about the safety of OxyContin, helping to unleash the opioid epidemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans. The company pulled in $2.4 billion in revenue from opioids in 2015. Purdue is the most successful (and deadly) drug pusher in American history. Honorable mentions There are many other companies that could have easily made the list. What about the Big Banks? They helped bring on the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. But no top executives went to jail. Maybe I should single out other energy companies for polluting the Earth or killing its workers? Or the Big Internet companies for invading customer privacy? Or Big Tobacco for killing hundreds of millions of people? Or the health-care companies that rip off Medicare and kill tens of thousands each year due to faulty diagnosis, improper prescriptions and botched treatment? Or the Trump Organization for taking public corruption to new heights? David Dao got beat up and lived. At least he’ll get some semblance of justice, unlike so many others.

426,,2232017,Reuters,2162017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks’ ties to the sector. In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown. The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks’ involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices. The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules. Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain. The Fed’s proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator’s highest charge for the riskiest investments. The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns. In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities. In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt “competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy.” A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp, have also cited liquidity and price concerns. Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. Industry sources say the fight against the Fed’s proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.    Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground. ","

Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. Industry sources say the fight against the Fed’s proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.    Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground. ","

428,Mark Fahey,2232017,CNBC,2162017,"President Donald Trump's tax plan may cut the federal business income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but dozens of companies are already enjoying rates below the new maximum. The plan would be a windfall for retailers like Best Buy and CVS and for financial services companies like Visa and JPMorgan Chase, which tend to pay close to the 35 percent. On the other hand, companies that have access to substantial tax deductions and are already below 15 percent could suffer if the cut comes at the expense of closing tax loopholes. The average effective federal tax rate for profitable Fortune 500 companies was a little under 20 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a 2014 study by the progressive tax reform organization Citizens for Tax Justice. About 35 percent of those companies were already under Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. CTJ is in the process of updating those calculations, and most companies' tax rates have been fairly consistent over the long term. It's hard to know exactly how Trump's tax plan would affect individual companies, partly because the administration hasn't released the details of its proposal yet. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would make a ""phenomenal"" tax announcement in two or three weeks. On Wednesday he said tax reform was ""very well finalized"" but that it wouldn't come until after health-care reforms. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he wants to see the reforms passed before Congress goes on its August recess. According to Trump's published tax plan, ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes."" Mnuchin said the administration is looking at a combined plan with Republicans in Congress, who have been pushing a 20 percent business tax and a controversial border adjustment tax. The final mix of reforms could very well benefit companies that are currently paying more than 15 or 20 percent, while driving up taxes for companies that already have low rates thanks to loopholes. Trump's strategy for keeping the tax cuts revenue-neutral depends in part on eliminating some ""special interest loopholes."" ""You can make the basic observation that companies like Exxon Mobil that are routinely able to reduce their tax bill will likely benefit much less than companies in the retail sector, which traditionally pay a lot closer to 35 percent,"" said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at CTJ. ""Congress has enacted special tax breaks for a number of different industries, but retailers are generally unaffected and there aren't a lot of breaks designed for them."" Take a company like Amazon, which has paid 11 percent in taxes on its domestic income over the last eight years. According to the company's annual report, that rate was reached using a number of special deductions, including stock-based compensation deductions, accelerated depreciation deductions, research and development credits, and the domestic production activities deduction. Companies like Boeing (-1 percent from 2008 to 2012) and Honeywell (8 percent) use similar deductions and credits. ""The companies that tend to do the best tend to be companies that make a lot of capital investments, like utilities or manufacturers because the accelerated depreciation rules have been so generous over the last couple of decades,"" said Gardner. ""They give big rewards to anyone investing in factories or machinery."" Generally, the biggest deductions are more useful for companies in utilities, telecommunications, oil and gas, manufacturing and some pharmaceutical companies, while retailers, financial services, food companies and health-care companies tend to pay closer to the statutory rate. Take a look at all the profitable Fortune 500 companies below: The final impact of Trump's tax plan depends a lot on the revenue trade-offs that are included to pay for the cuts. A border tax, for example, would be a hit on retailers, but dropping the business tax rate would also disproportionately help retailers. Big companies may lose some deductions, but the plan also calls for a one-time repatriation of the $2.5 trillion in corporate cash sitting offshore at a 10 percent rate, which would save companies like Apple, Microsoft and Citigroup billions of dollars. As the plan stands now, it would increase the federal debt by $7.2 trillion over the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. An analysis by the Tax Foundation estimated revenues would be decreased by at least $4.4 trillion over the next decade, depending on the specific policy changes. Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it.""

429,Bob Pisani,2232017,CNBC,2162017,"Home Depot is at another historic high on Tuesday following its excellent earnings report, but a major factor behind its stock price rise has been dividend hikes (it raised its dividend 29 percent on Tuesday), and an aggressive buyback program, including the new $15 billion share buyback program that it also announced. To give you an idea of just how big a $15 billion buyback is, the company's market cap is roughly $175 billion, so we are talking about buying back nearly 9 percent of the company. Even by the standards of the last decade, that is a big buyback. Home Depot is part of a select group of companies I call ""buyback monsters,"" companies that have bought back more than 25 percent of their shares since 2000. Why 2000? Because most companies hit their highest levels of shares outstanding between 2000 and 2006; since then, most companies have been reducing share count, in some cases aggressively. Consider Home Depot. In 2003, they had 2.36 billion shares outstanding, according to Factset. Today, they have 1.21 billion shares outstanding. That is half the shares they had outstanding 14 years ago. All other things being equal, that means earnings are twice as high as they would have been in 2003, when there were twice as many shares outstanding. Home Depot isn't alone. IBM had 1.9 billion shares outstanding in 1997, today it has about 950 million, again less than half what it had 20 years ago. ExxonMobil had 7 billion shares outstanding in 2000, today it has 4.1 billion, a reduction of about 42 percent. This is not a trend that is limited by any one sector. There are companies that have been aggressively reducing their share counts in Industrials, Technology, and Consumer: Industrials: share count reductionsNorthrup Grumman: 50 percent since 2003CSX: 29 percent since 20003M: 25 percent since 2000United Technologies: 25 percent since 2005 Technology: share count reductionsMicrosoft: 30 percent since 2004Intel: 30 percent since 2001Cisco: 32 percent since 2001 Why are there buybacks at all? They were originally used to support the issuance of stock options. The options increased the share count outstanding, so to keep the count down the company bought back shares. But as the opportunity for significant top-line growth waned, buybacks to reduce share counts became a separate strategy to prop up earnings growth. And that's my beef: Buybacks are a form of financial engineering. Here's another problem: It's not at all clear that buying companies just because they are buying back shares will be a successful investment strategy. Take IBM — despite being one of the most aggressive buyback monsters on the Street, you can't say IBM's stock price has soared in the last decade. In 2014, the company eased off a bit on its buybacks, and the stock headed south. It headed south because IBM was beset by fundamental growth issues: Its revenues from its old line businesses were shrinking and there was notrevenue from nascent businesses (like Watson and artificial intelligence) replacing it. The lesson: No amount of financial engineering like buying back shares can replace management's inability to grow the business. Not surprisingly, there are ETFs for all this, but their performance has been spotty. ThePowerShares Buyback Achievers ETF (PKW) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares in the previous 12 months. Top holdings include McDonald's, Boeing, and QUALCOMM. It has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in the last year, but it has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points over a two-year period. So just reducing shares doesn't necessarily mean that companies will outperform. A better approach might be that taken by the AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS), which uses a ""smart beta"" approach that screens not just for reduction of shares but also free cash flow, and no increase to leverage. The TTFS has outperformed the PKW by about 9 percentage points in the past two years. Do not expect buybacks to go away. Buybacks could become an even bigger business, if the whole business of tax reductions become a reality. Billions could be repatriated from overseas, and most strategists believe that a large amount of that money could find its way into buybacks. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Even as stocks were steadier Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, some charts still look dicey, and that could be a warning for the broader market.

430,"George Budwell, Rich Smith, and Neha Chamaria",2232017,Fool,2162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, can be a powerful and smart way to pursue above-average income opportunities in the market. The short story is that ETFs provide instant diversification, thus lowering the risk of holding a single high-yield stock that may turn out to be a ticking time bomb later on down the road. Given the expansive universe of high-yield ETFs in existence at the moment, however, it's not exactly easy to choose the cream of the crop. Our Foolish team of dividend experts, though, think that the iShares Core High Dividend (NYSEMKT:HDV), the Vanguard REIT ETF (NYSEMKT:VNQ), and the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT:DWX) could all boost your portfolio's earnings power to the next level. Here's why. Image Source: Getty Images. George Budwell (iShares Core High Dividend): While the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund's yield of 3.31% won't exactly knock your socks off, this well-diversified ETF does come with a rock bottom expense ratio of 0.12% and a solid track record of producing outstanding returns on capital. Long story short, the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund has marched steadily northward since its inception approximately 6 years ago, outperforming most of its peers in the process: HDV data by YCharts. What's underneath the hood? This ETF tracks a dividend-weighted index of 75 U.S. equities that pay a better than average yield. And as an added measure, the fund also screens equities for high earnings potential and dividend sustainability in order to up the overall quality of its holdings. The net result is that the iShares Core High Dividend Equity Fund is made up of mostly dividend stalwarts like ExxonMobile, Chevron Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, among many others. That's an impressive roster of blue-chip companies by any measure and underscores why this ETF has performed so well during the market's lengthy bull run over the past several years. As a prime example, J&J has been able to maintain one of the strongest balance sheet ratings among U.S. equities for decades, despite its heavy investment in its dividend program and R&D activities. Pfizer is also a well-known cash cow with outstanding free cash flows and a superb balance sheet in its own right. In all, this dividend ETF offers a nice mix of high-quality equities, a respectable yield, and a bargain-basement expense ratio. Neha Chamaria (Vanguard REIT ETF): With a dividend yield of 6%, Vanguard REIT ETF is my top pic for income investors. As its name suggests, this ETF invests only in REITs, which also explains its high yields, though it isn't exactly a dividend-themed fund. As you might know, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their income to shareholders to avoid paying taxes. This ETF, which tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, holds 156 real estate investment trust stocks that invest in properties across diverse sectors, including healthcare, industrials, offices, residential, and hotels. You can get a fair idea about the diversity within the REITs this ETF offers when you realize that its top holdings include names like Simon Property Group, Public Storage, Prologis, and Equinix. At about 23%, retail REITs have the largest exposure in this ETF, and residential and specialized REITs come in next with about 16% share in assets each. You might be wondering why I'm optimistic about a REIT ETF in a rising interest rate scenario -- higher interest rates, after all, have traditionally hurt REIT valuations. Vanguard, however, has held up pretty strong in the past three months, and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to do so. One reason is that most of the ETF's top holdings have strong track records of growth in funds from operations and dividends. Just to give you an example, Simon Property's dividend has grown at an annual compounded rate of 13.2% in the past five years. Moreover, as Vanguard is a diversified ETF, there will ideally almost always be pockets of strength in its portfolio even during adverse times. Potential higher infrastructure spending under Donald Trump's presidency could, for instance, boost manufacturing activity and prospects for office and industrial REITs, allowing them to command higher rents. Likewise, higher consumer confidence bodes well for retail REITs, and so on. Finally, this ETF's expense ratio of 0.12% is not only substantially lower than those of industry peers, but also among the lowest in the REIT space. That means greater savings and higher returns for shareholders while they enjoy the hefty dividends along the way. Right now, the U.S. dollar is still not far off its five-year high, making companies' income earned (and dividends paid) in foreign currency worth relatively less when converted back into U.S. dollars. To my mind, that makes now a good time to look for foreign dividend payers as a promising investment -- because they'll be worth more once exchange rates turn around. My pick for this play on exchange rates is therefore the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF, which tracks the 100 highest-yielding dividend-paying companies outside the U.S. This $1 billion fund carries a hefty, but not unreasonable, expense ratio of 0.45%, but a market-beating dividend yield of 5.1%. Even after deducting expenses, the SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF yields twice the average dividend yield on the S&P 500. Valuation-wise, this ETF's stocks carry an average P/E ratio of 17.1 -- which is also well below the S&P's average P/E of 25.7. The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF achieves diversification in its portfolio by capping exposure to any given region of the world at 25% (it's maxed out on financials right now, for example, and getting close to 25% on energy companies), and capping exposure to individual market sectors at 25% as well. Although DWX has underperformed over the past five years, it may finally be coming into its own here near the dollar's peak, and delivered a near 25% return to investors over the past year. My bet: The SPDR S&P International Dividend ETF will continue to outperform as the dollar's value peaks, plateaus, and begins to drop off. ","

The EEA joins a growing list of joint initiatives by large companies aiming to take advantage of blockchain, a shared digital record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. Companies in a wide range of industries are hoping that it can help them streamline some of their processes, such as the clearing and settling of financial securities. The EEA underscores the enthusiasm around the nascent technology, but also highlights some of the hurdles that companies must still overcome before they can deploy blockchain on a large scale. This includes ensuring that the technology can support the vast number of transactions processed by large corporations, while being secure enough to meet their stringent security standards. Unlike some other collaborative efforts, members do not need to pay a fee to participate in the EEA, for now. Ethereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications, was invented by 23-year-old programer Vitalik Buterin. Several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. Alex Batlin, global blockchain lead at BNY Mellon, one of the companies on the EEA board, said over the past few years banks and other enterprises have increased collaboration with the Ethereum development community, facilitating the creation of the EEA. “There is a lot more synergy in thinking than was ever possible before,” Batlin said. The EEA will collaborate with the non-profit foundation that promotes the development of Ethereum, the companies said. ","

(V) and retailer Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY), which generally pay close to the top rate of 35%, according to CNBC. Many investors will likely focus on Trump's joint address to Congress on February 28, during which he is expected to discuss his plans for tax reform, The Washington Post reported. However, many firms will likely derive little benefit from such tax reform, as they already have an effective tax rate below 15%. (For more, see also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.) While there are many companies that have paid a low effective rate in recent years, a perfect example is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The online retailer has enjoyed an effective tax rate of 11% on its domestic income over the last eight years, according to CNBC. Amazon harnessed several special deductions, including ones involving accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, and research and development credits, according to the company's annual report. Amazon is not alone in benefiting from this special treatment, as companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) are ""routinely able to reduce their tax bill,"" Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at tax policy think tank Citizens for Tax Justice (CTH) told CNBC. Amid this situation, Exxon Mobil and AT&T Inc. (T) paid effective tax rates of 14% and 7% between 2008 and 2012, CTJ data reveals. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and General Electric Company (GE) both had negative rates during that time, paying 2% and 11%,respectively. However, the special deductions that these companies have been leveraging are likely to disappear under Trump's plan, Stephan Unger, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Investopedia during an interview. The ""current special deduction possibilities are likely to get abandoned to make the system more transparent and efficient,"" he said. However, whether or not ""special tax treatments for specific companies"" will end up disappearing completely remains unclear, stated Unger. Tax expert Nate Smith offered a different point of view, stating during a separate interview with Investopedia that while ""certain industries (like oil and gas) benefit from specific deductions ... the deduction provisions that could be disappearing are not the thrust of what Trump's reform would target."" The more important matter is changing tax law so that companies will repatriate profits, said Smith. Currently, multinational corporations can keep these earnings overseas indefinitely, shielding them from the higher tax rates, he told Investopedia. Frequently, managing their international footprint is the means of minimizing tax expenses, said Smith. Originally, Trump's campaign tax proposal sought to rectify this situation, he noted. (For more, see also: Can Trump Tax Plan Bring Back Overseas Cash?) Because of policies like these, many global companies are paying very little in the way of taxes, Tenpao Lee, interim dean and professor of economics at Niagara University, stated during an Investopedia interview. Should lawmakers cut the top corporate income tax rate to 15%, it would give major companies greater motivation to move their profits back to the United States. However, the impact may not take effect immediately, said Lee, as companies would need time to adjust. For companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), the effect would be significant, whereas companies like Exxon Mobil and Amazon would see less of an impact, he told Investopedia.

Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it.""

435,Reuben Gregg Brewer,3022017,Fool,2232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

436,,3022017,MarketWatch,2232017,"The Dow Jones industrial average stormed past 21,000 for the first time Wednesday as investors absorbed President Trump’s address to Congress, in which he pledged business-friendly proposals like tax cuts, deregulation and an increase in infrastructure and defense spending. Wednesday’s sprint past 21,000 matched the previous record for 1,000-point gains, set in 1999 when the Dow ran from 10,000 to 11,000 in 24 trading sessions. “President Trump came out and gave a presidential speech, which reassured a lot of people who questioned whether his administration would reach normality,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “The political uncertainty has been one of the factors holding the market back in the face of an improving economy. The fact that political uncertainty may be starting to subside may be counted as really good news.” Stocks motored across the board Wednesday. The Dow closed at 21,115, a 1.4 percent gain on the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index increased 1.3 percent, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index was up 1.9 percent. Apple, Boeing and Goldman Sachs Group have propelled most of the gain in the Dow industrials during its 1,000-point dash. Wednesday was the biggest one-day point lift for the blue-chip index since Election Day 2016. The 30 stocks have continued to surge from below 19,000 without looking back. “In terms of percentage moves, the move in 1999 was much larger,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. “Nonetheless, this only reinforces how strong the rally has been since the election.” Detrick said the strong earnings season is pushing the market forward more than Trump. “This helps justify the gains, as it isn’t all based on hopes for tax reform or infrastructure spending,” he said. “There is real economic improvement now that has sparked much of the rally.” William Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday night that tightening monetary policy had become “more compelling,” making a rate increase more likely for March 15. Higher interest rates are good for banks’ loan business. The market responded, with JPMorgan Chase shares up 3.3 percent Wednesday and Citigroup shares up 2.9 percent. Wednesday’s gains overshadowed the reported pricing of Snap Inc. at $17 per share, which would value the parent of the popular disappearing-message app Snapchat at almost $24 billion and above the projected share range of $14 to $16. The stock is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the “SNAP” ticker. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes was 2.45 percent. The 30-year yield climbed above 3 percent. Crude oil declined, and gold fell to $1,249.80 per ounce as investors swarmed stocks. Analysts said they did not see anything tying down equities. “Sentiment keeps improving,” McMillan said. “With consumer confidence at 15-year highs, with manufacturing sentiment continuing to move up, the economy and business are actually quite sound.” Read more: The big-deal lesson from the (not so important) Dow 20,000 What the Yahoo sale tells us about stock market bubbles This could change everything we thought we knew about investing  ","Dow busts through 21,000 threshold on feel-good Trump message - The Washington Post",0.9953

Some analysts suggested that the absence of protectionist comments as well as his overall tone that was perceived as “presidential” instilled confidence among investors, sending global equity markets higher. Stocks even rose slightly higher following the release of the Fed’s Beige Book, which pointed out that business optimism has cooled a bit since the election.

The surge for stocks, on the heels of Trump’s speech, also comes as the expectation for a rate increase by the Federal Reserve as early as mid-March have increased significantly. The probability for a March rate increase stands at 66%, up from a probability of 35% on Tuesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “What’s really changed on the economic front is tough to say,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, in an interview. “But the Trump speech moved expectations higher. Now it’ll be a surprise if [the Fed doesn’t] raise rates.” Read:  This stock-market rally isn’t all about Trump’s newfound ‘tone’ Adding to that, on Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for a U.S. interest rate increase has become “a lot more compelling.” “The economy is doing well, as we can see from today’s inflation and manufacturing numbers and any additional stimulus will put it into even a higher gear, and stock markets like that,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “I think the Fed’s clear optimism about the economy, even when not factoring in a Trump boost, is feeding the positive sentiment in the markets at the moment,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in emailed comments. “Investors don’t fear rate increases like they have in the past, instead it’s the pace of tightening that they’re focused on, and three hikes this year is clearly palatable,” he added. However some investors still see prices for stocks getting lofty after a string of records for U.S. equity benchmarks in 2017. Substantial gains in the markets have sent valuations to highest levels in more than a decade, with some analysts warning of potential pullbacks. “When markets are extended and overbought, they are vulnerable to any shocks that could trigger pullbacks or corrections,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. The Dow industrials ran from clearing 20,000 for the first time to clearing 21,000 in 24 sessions, tying a record set in 1999 for the shortest 1,000-point gain. While the current jump is smaller on a percentage basis, it’s still psychologically compelling, especially when it took nearly two years for the Dow to reach 19,000 after it first passed 18,000, as markets were dealing with an earnings recession, Detrick said. “Now, earnings are picking up and we’re breaking out in quick fashion,” said Detrick. “The concern now is if we got to 22,000 quickly and hit a blowoff top. Some pullback is normal and we want to see a correction. No more than 5% to 7% would be perfectly normal considering the rally since the election.” Themis’s Kepner also said that at some point markets will need specifics on the fiscal stimulus to justify current price-to-earnings ratios. “But for now, it seems that investors are content with the reasonable tone of the president, while impending rate hikes are seen in the context of an improving economy,” Krosby said. On the data front, a report on personal income and outlays showed that the cost of goods and services outpaced household income, with the year-over-year inflation rising to the highest level since 2012. Higher pace of inflation is another reason the Fed might be eager to go ahead with rate normalization sooner rather than later. The manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.7% in February, its best level in more than two years. Meanwhile, construction spending declined 1% in January.

438,Ryan Vlastelica,3022017,MarketWatch,2232017,"Published: Feb 27, 2017 8:07 a.m. ET Dow’s 11-day streak of records is longest since 1987 By U.S. stocks staged a last-minute rally on Friday, with major indexes turning positive ahead of the closing bell and the Dow extended its record-setting streak as investors shrugged off concerns the rally was overdone. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose for a fifth straight week, while the Dow brought its string of weekly gains to three.

The blue-chip average rose for an 11th straight day for the first time since 1992, as well as its 11th straight record closing high—the longest such streak since 1987. The Dow had traded in negative territory for essentially the entire session, only breaking into the green with seconds to spare. “There was concern that the market was getting tired and that we were losing momentum, but there are still significant inflows, because now even the pessimists want a piece of the action. It’s momentum driven, not fundamentally driven,” said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors.

But there is weakness in the Trump-leadership stocks,” Glazer said. “Financials are notably weak, Goldman is notably weak. That’s due to both profit-taking and high valuations.” For the holiday-shortened week, major indexes posted gains. The Dow rose 1% on the week while the S&P added 0.7% and the Nasdaq rose 0.1%. That marked the fifth straight weekly advance for the S&P and the Nasdaq, and the third straight for the Dow. The Dow is up nearly 9.1% over the past three months, with investors attributing gains largely to Trump’s November election victory. Investors are betting that Trump’s policies on taxes and regulation will accelerate economic growth and boost corporate earnings, but concerns are growing over the administration’s ability to deliver on the tax plans. Markets saw little impact from a speech Trump gave at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he said that the U.S. tax code would be made more fair. Investors are also looking ahead to an address that Trump is scheduled to make to Congress on Feb. 28, where he is expected to provide details on his highly anticipated tax reform proposals.

440,,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world’s largest gathering of energy executives. Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said. Woods ran Exxon’s refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon’s growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding. “Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Woods said. “These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics.” The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs. “The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots,” Woods said. Exxon last month pledged to boost this year’s spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company’s spending plans as an example of “a true American success story.” Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year. “This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,” Trump said. When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief. The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports. Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production. Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said. “I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken,” he said. “It underestimates the power of technology.” Woods highlighted Exxon’s research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas. “The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating,” he said. Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors. ","

441,,3092017,Reuters,3022017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

442,Patti Domm,3092017,CNBC,3022017,"The power of the North American energy industry is that it transcends borders, and while it was interconnected way before NAFTA, it is becoming even more so. The ties are deep rooted. In the early 1900s, primitive power lines sent electricity crackling across the border between Texas and Mexico. Canada has long provided the U.S. hydroelectric power, and all three countries now send oil, refined fuels and natural gas back and forth across the northern and southern U.S. borders on a daily basis. With trade the hot topic in Washington and now for all three members of NAFTA, the fallout from the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement and the U.S. proposals about taxing goods at the border can't help but be an important topic when the global energy industry meets in Houston this week. In fact, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will deliver a keynote address on Thursday, which he tweeted would be about innovation and renewable energy. CERAWeek by IHS Markit runs Monday through Friday and participants include energy ministers from Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as CEOs from major oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Total. ""I expect to hear a great deal at CERAWeek from Prime Minister Trudeau and industry leaders about the importance and mutual benefit from the large cross-border energy [integration]. Whatever the eventual outcome of the NAFTA debate, they're not going to want to lose benefits,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS. The Trump administration promises to be a strong supporter of energy, removing regulatory hurdles for the industry and encouraging more U.S. drilling. Just last week former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was approved to be Energy Secretary. Perry has spoken positively about North American integration in the past, and until recently he was on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, which is building pipelines to take natural gas to Mexico. But the administration has also been critical of Mexico for what it claims are unfair trade practices and weak immigration controls. So even though the industry is intertwined, the future course for North American energy is murky. Guaranteed to be discussed at CERAWeek is the proposal from House Republicans to tax imports into the United States at a rate of 20 percent. The so-called border-adjustment tax is a major revenue generator for the House corporate tax reform plan. It is bound to generate as much debate in the energy industry gathering as it has in other affected industries, such as retail. Critics already say it would drive up both oil and gasoline prices. But proponents, among them big industrial companies, say the dollar would adjust by rising sharply and neutralizing some of the impact of higher prices. Conceivably, under the proposal, a barrel of oil from Canada could be taxed as it enters the United States, but the gasoline it is made into would not be taxed when it is sent to Mexico. Likewise, a barrel of U.S. crude would not be taxed as it enters Canada, but the gasoline that comes back down to New England could be taxed. The North American energy interconnections are complex and more established between the United States and Canada, which is the largest crude supplier to the United States and also a net exporter of electricity from connections that run along the border in numerous locations. Canada exports natural gas to the United States, and U.S. natural gas is sold in Canada. But the connections to Mexico are also growing, especially since the country embarked on a reform program to overhaul its energy industry and bring in new investment. It has also been aggressively planning new power generation. Mexico was importing about 4.2 billion cubic feet of U.S. natural gas per day in August, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and analysts say it could get to 5 billion in the near future. U.S. sales of gas to Mexico are also helping depressed U.S. natural gas prices from sinking even lower, analysts say. Gas pipeline exports to Mexico from the United States doubled since 2009. According to Citigroup, new cross-border pipeline capacity of 7 billion cubic feet is expected to come online by 2020, on top of the current 6 billion to 7 billion cubic feet. ""The growing energy integration of North America is very beneficial to all three countries,"" said Yergin. ""U.S. natural gas producers get additional markets, while Mexican consumers get lower-priced electricity generated with that gas. Canadians get markets for their oil, reducing U.S. reliance on Venezuelan oil, while American workers in manufacturing benefit from big equipment markets to the north."" Mexico also recently put out bids for offshore exploration, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the companies receiving awards. ""It will give them an opportunity to bring international technology and capital in to develop Mexico's deep water. Pemex never could have developed that,"" said Carlos Pascual, senior vice president of IHS Markit. Pascual has served as the U.S. State Department's special envoy for energy and coordinator for international energy affairs. He was also a former ambassador to Mexico. José Antonio González Anaya, director general of Pemex, will be a speaker at CERAWeek. Jaime Francisco Hernández Martínez, CEO of Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is also participating. ""The prospects are for additional gas supply only to continue to increase, and right now we see over the next five years, at least, relatively flat prices for natural gas globally, so the question then becomes, Where does American natural gas fit in?"" Pascual said. One solution is exporting it to Mexico, the largest buyer of U.S. natural gas. He said Mexico will also open up its unconventional drilling opportunities, holding its first round of bidding for unconventional oil and gas later this year. ""In the United States, there's been a huge benefit in the sale of natural gas to Mexico and also in the renewable-energy sector. Many of these companies buy GE equipment, for example. GE is a massive player here, particularly in wind turbines, so there's been a very significant boost to American commercial interests as a result of the development of natural gas and the power sector,"" Pascual said. The U.S. oil relationship with Canada, too, can only deepen when the Keystone XL pipeline is built. President Donald Trump waved on that controversial project shortly after his inauguration, and last week the White House said the TransCanada pipeline would be exempted from the new requirement that pipelines be built with U.S. steel. The Keystone would bring 800,000 barrels a day from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, before it heads to the Gulf Coast. ""This integration is not only beneficial from an economic point of view but also from a development point of view, which was one of the reasons it was encouraged in the first place,"" said Yergin.

443,Reuben Gregg Brewer,3092017,Fool,3022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

444,Jeff Reeves,3092017,MarketWatch,3022017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data. So it is no wonder that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have proven a poor investment, with a return of less than 20% since the March 2009 lows based on the performance of the popular iShares TIPS Bond ETF

However, there’s also a good chance that the Federal Reserve will quickly act to keep inflation in check now that it has been striking a more hawkish tone.

                                    is in favor. But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

Gold is volatile, yes, but seems a decent bet going forward for tactical traders. But remember the history of gold’s performance since 2009, and don’t treat this volatile asset as a sure thing to buy and hold long-term.

But since then, the index has struggled to hold on to further gains, recently dipping under 20,000 just before Christmas. Of course, roughly 90% returns since the bear market lows still annualizes out to over 10% a year, so some folks may not see China as a that bad of a bet. However, it is important to remember that American investors with exposure to Chinese equities often have imperfect exposure to this market.

                                   the most popular China fund right now with some $3 billion in assets under management. This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

Of course, the ETF had a heck of a 2016 as energy stocks bounced back with a vengeance; the sector-specific fund tacked on about 25% last year to more than double the S&P 500’s returns. So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general. Profits remain seriously under pressure at both Big Oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp.

446,,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

447,,3162017,Reuters,3092017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, used an alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The attorney general’s office said in a letter on Monday that it found Tillerson had used an alias email address under the pseudonym “Wayne Tracker” from at least 2008 through 2015. Wayne is Tillerson’s middle name. The letter was sent to a New York state judge overseeing Schneiderman’s investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change. In a statement on Monday, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, “The email address, Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, is part of the company’s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics.” Jeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman’s office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. The letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account. It asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the “Wayne Tracker” email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved. The letter said that Exxon had produced some 60 documents bearing the “Wayne Tracker” email but never said it was used by Tillerson for relevant communications at Exxon. It asked the court to order Exxon to identify whether any other email accounts were used by Tillerson. “Exxon’s top executives, and in particular, Mr. Tillerson, have made multiple representations that are at the center of OAG’s (attorney general’s office) investigation of potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public,” the letter said. The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016. ","

449,Matthew Johnston,3162017,Investopedia,3092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On paper, the United States has the highest corporate income tax, at 35%, amongst all of the OECD industrialized nations. President Donald Trump has promised to cut that rate to 15% even as he has boasted that his corporate empire has managed to pay little to no income tax in some years. Yet, he is not alone, as hardly any company pays the full 35%, as indicated in a recent New York Times article. Some companies have even managed to pay absolutely zero in income taxes, and no, it is not because they weren’t profitable. (For more, see: How Trump's Proposals Can Impact Your Taxes.) The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), in a recent study, found that over the eight-year period from 2008 to 2015, 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 21.2%. Over that same period, exactly 18 companies, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E Corp., avoided paying a single penny of federal income tax. The complete list of the 18 corporations is listed below in a graphic from ITEP’s report: A total of 100 companies avoided paying income taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015, and their combined pretax income during that period totaled $336 billion. Yet, instead of paying $118 billion according to the 35% statutory income tax rate, the number of tax breaks applicable to these companies allowed them to earn a negative effective tax rate. That means they actually earned more in their after-tax income than in their pretax income, often due to tax rebates from the U.S. Treasury. There are several major ways that corporations avoid paying taxes, or manage to earn tax subsidies. One way is through finding ways to shift U.S. profits to foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates, a practice known as offshore tax sheltering. Another way is through the use of accelerated depreciation. The relative degree of freedom in tax laws has allowed companies to expense the cost of their capital at a faster pace than it actually wears out. This allows a company to declare less income and thus defer paying taxes until later years, and as long as the company continues to invest, the deferral of taxes can continue for an indefinite amount of time. The giving of stock options to employees, as a part of their compensation, is another avenue that has helped companies reduce their total tax bill. When the options are exercised, the difference between what employees pay for the stock and its market value can be claimed for a tax deduction. Finally, some industries such as research, oil and gas drilling, ethanol production, alternative energy, video game and film production, are privileged by the federal tax code to receive certain tax breaks. (For more, see: How Big Corporations Avoid Big Tax Bills.) Over the eight years, more than half of the total tax subsidies, which totaled $286 billion, went to just 25 companies. AT&T raked in the largest amount with a total of $38 billion in subsidies over the period. Other major recipients included Wells Fargo at $31.4 billion, J.P. Morgan Chase at $22.2 billion, Verizon at $21.1 billion, IBM at $17.8 billion and Exxon Mobil at $12.9 billion.   ",How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax | Investopedia,0.9678
450, ,3162017,CNBC,3092017,"BlackRock Inc, which wields outsized clout as the world's largest asset manager, planned on Monday to put new pressure on companies to explain themselves on issues including how climate change could affect their business as well as boardroom diversity. The move by BlackRock, a powerful force in Corporate America with $5.1 trillion under management, could bolster efforts like climate-risk disclosure practices developed by the Financial Stability Board, the international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. BlackRock, which holds stakes in most major U.S. corporations, identified its top ""engagement priorities"" for meetings this year with corporate leaders in documents to be posted on its website on Monday, with climate risk and boardroom diversity on the list. Reuters received advance copies of the materials. Michelle Edkins, set to oversee the outreach effort as head of a 30-person team, said BlackRock might want to hear from companies about how they are assessing the risk that climate change may pose to their operations. Edkins cited the example of how rising ocean levels could swamp a real estate company's valuable beachfront property. Some companies have shown leadership on the areas BlackRock considers priorities, Edkins said, while others need improvement. ""There are firms where we think they're probably not moving fast enough given the risks to the business,"" Edkins said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The action marked a step-up in BlackRock's advocacy with boards and executives, and comes after the fund giant was criticized by environmental and labor activists for not backing proxy resolutions dealing with climate change and other topics more often at shareholder meetings. BlackRock stopped short of pledging to vote more often against companies' management. It said it still prefers private meetings with executives and casts critical proxy votes only as a last straw. ""We can't micromanage,"" Edkins said. Activists said BlackRock deserves credit for making climate change a central focus. ""They have made a turn in the road. They are looking at their proxies differently,"" said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management in Boston. Outlining its priorities, BlackRock urged some companies to be ready to discuss concerns such as how they could use climate-risk disclosure practices developed by a Financial Stability Board task force. BlackRock also said it will expect that at companies in sectors associated with climate risk such as oil producers, miners or real estate companies, all directors should ""have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business"" and how a given company will address it. As a result of BlackRock's new initiative, Smith said Walden and others including a Seattle city employees' retirement system have withdrawn a proposal calling for the fund giant to review its proxy-voting process and record on climate change. Smith said BlackRock's new approach could make a difference such as on resolutions urging energy giants to report on the impact that public policies aimed at curbing climate change could have on their business. One such resolution at Exxon Mobil last year received support from around 38 percent of votes cast. BlackRock opposed the resolution and owned about 6 percent of the company at the time, securities filings show. Edkins said BlackRock's votes on such measures in the future would depend on circumstances like how they are worded. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment ahead of the company's proxy statement due next month. BlackRock also said it will look to understand how companies are working to increase boardroom diversity, such as adding more women. ""Diverse boards, including but not limited to diversity of expertise, experience, age, race and gender, make better decisions,"" BlackRock said in the documents. Some companies wrongly believe they already possess a diverse board of directors, Edkins said. ""A guy from Yale and a guy from Harvard does not count as diversity,"" Edkins said. BlackRock's guidance marks the latest investor call for corporate executives to pay more attention to matters to which they might have given little thought in the past. New deposits into funds that invest according to environmental, social or responsible governance criteria have been a rare bright spot for active fund managers lately. Big fund firms have taken notice. State Street Corp, a BlackRock rival, used International Women's Day last week to urge companies to improve their board diversity. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has advocated governance reforms in annual letters to other CEOs, such as urging them to avoid too much focus on short-term results. BlackRock said it also plans to press boards about worker issues in light of matters such as uneven wage growth. Edkins pointed to Wal-Mart Stores Inc as an example of a company that embraced the idea that higher wages can lead to a more-engaged workforce. ""Pay that doesn't seem to achieve some sense of equity within a company is likely to make an unattractive place to work,"" Edkins said.

Here's a bit of trivia for you: Over its lifetime, the popular crowd-funding website Kickstarter has created enough jobs to fill up an entire monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics job report. Image source: Getty Images. Even if you discount the part-time workers, that makes for more than three full-time jobs created for each successful start-up, confirming that Kickstarter ""companies"" are more than just one lonely nerd working in a garage. At the very least, each of those nerds has two full-time, salary-drawing employees on the payroll -- and a couple dozen collaborators doing piecework on his project. From 2009 through August 2015, when I last looked in on Kickstarter's progress, the company had helped its users attract crowd funding for more than 90,000 projects. That number has since kicked up to well over 120,000, with ""19,235 successfully funded projects"" in 2016 alone. Every dollar pledged to a successfully funded project resulted in $2.46 in additional revenue for the creator, leading to an estimated $5.3 billion in additional economic activity, says Penn. In total, the University estimates that Kickstarter has added $5.3 billion to the national GDP over the past eight years. It's also done its part as a responsible taxpayer. In 2016, the company says it paid a ""combined effective tax rate of 25%."" Image source: Kickstarter. Of course, unlike Exxon, Kickstarter is not a publicly traded stock. Privately held, it would ordinarily be under no obligation to disclose any of the facts and figures we've discussed here. That said, in 2015, Kickstarter reincorporated itself as a special kind of corporation -- a ""public benefit corporation."" PBCs also undertake to publish an annual benefit report updating the general public on the overall social impact their activities have had in the preceding year. It was this report that led to the revelations last week -- and we look forward to reading many more such reports as Kickstarter continues to lead the crowd-funding movement in years to come.

452,"Timothy Green, Matthew DiLallo, Dan Caplinger, and Brian Feroldi",3162017,Fool,3092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For long-term dividend investors, the best type of stock is one that can be bought and largely forgotten about, with the occasional checkup to make sure those dividend checks aren't in danger. A few of the Fool's contributors have identified four high-yield dividend stocks that fit this description. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), ONEOK (NYSE:OKE), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) are great buy-and-hold dividend stocks. Tim Green (Microsoft): Being a technology company, Microsoft is more susceptible to disruption than other dividend-paying stalwarts. But it's not a company that investors need to worry too much about. Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has shed its image as a tech dinosaur and aggressively embraced cloud computing. Microsoft's stranglehold on the productivity software market remains intact, its cloud-computing platform is a strong No. 2 player, and innovations like the HoloLens augmented reality headset could put Microsoft right at the center of the next computing revolution. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's dividend, currently yielding about 2.4%, isn't all that high. But it's superior to that of the average yield of stocks in the S&P 500, which yields less than 2%. Microsoft produces an incredible amount of free cash flow -- nearly $25 billion in fiscal 2016. This fueled not only $11 billion in dividend payments, putting the payout ratio at about 44%, but also $16 billion of share buybacks. There's still plenty of room to grow the dividend going forward, even without much earnings growth. Microsoft's cash-rich balance sheet is another reason the stock is attractive to dividend investors aiming to buy and hold for many years. Microsoft had net cash of $37.8 billion at the end of the latest quarter, providing a massive cushion that can sustain the dividend even in the roughest economic conditions. While there are higher-yielding stocks available, Microsoft is a good option for long-term investors. Brian Feroldi (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): It is natural for income-focused investors to want to own stocks that offer up higher yields than the market in general. However, picking the right high-yield stocks can be tricky, since a massive payout can sometimes actually be a warning sign. One alternative that is available to all investors is to instead invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on dividend stocks with above-average yields. If that sounds like a smart way to go, then I'd suggest that you give the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF a closer look. This passively managed ETF owns more than 400 stocks that have higher yields than the market in general. Its biggest holdings are all names that investors are familiar with -- think Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson -- which also provides investors with an extra layer of stability. The VYM currently offers a dividend yield of 3%, which is more than 50% higher than that of the S&P 500 average yield. Better yet, this fund's 10-year total return -- which accounts for the reinvestment of dividends -- is neck and neck with the S&P 500. VYM Total Return Price data by YCharts. Despite all of its benefits, Vanguard only charges a minuscule 0.08% expense ratio to access this ETF. Thus, if you are after a high yield but don't want to pick individual stocks, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF could be an excellent choice for you. Dan Caplinger (ONEOK): The plunge in energy prices in 2015 hurt companies throughout the industry, and even midstream infrastructure plays like ONEOK took big hits in their share prices. Yet after losing 70% of its share price, ONEOK has surged in the past year, nearly tripling as investors have figured out that not all companies have the same exposure to crude oil prices as others. ONEOK has an impressive slate of infrastructure assets, helping in the gathering process of natural gas from the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-Continent regions of the U.S. and then processing, storing, and transporting it to key market centers in the energy industry. That business relies more on production volume than on price, and although the producers that ONEOK works with transport more natural gas when prices are favorable, the energy transportation giant has still been able to produce solid results as oil and natural gas prices have rebounded. ONEOK currently has a yield of 4.5%, but that figure should go up when the company completes its planned acquisition of its ONEOK Partners (NYSE:OKS) master limited partnership. Once the MLP deal is complete, ONEOK expects to boost dividends by a fifth, which should help the yield even further. As long as energy prices remain strong enough to induce its clients to send natural gas through its infrastructure network, ONEOK will be in position to keep delivering income to its investors. Matt DiLallo (Enterprise Products Partners): Pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has an excellent track record of paying investors an above-average dividend. In fact, since going public in 1998, the company has raised its payout 59 times, including in each of the past 50 quarters. These haven't been token increases, either, with its last payout representing a 5.1% raise over the prior year. All these increases have added up over the years, with the company currently yielding a very generous 5.8%. That payout is about as safe as they come. First of all, more than 85% of Enterprise's cash flow comes from fee-based service contracts, which provides it with very stable cash flow. Furthermore, the company pays out less than 80% of its cash flow, which is well below the near-100% payout ratios of the average MLP. Finally, the company has a top-notch balance sheet, evidenced by the fact it has one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs. Add it up, and Enterprise has the financial strength to maintain its distribution rather easily. That said, the company is more likely to maintain its distribution growth streak than simply keep things status quo. Fueling that growth potential is the fact that it has $6.7 billion of growth projects under construction and several additional projects under development. These new assets should enable the company to continue growing its cash flow, giving it more money to return to investors. Needless to say, this is one dividend stock that will not cause investors any worry. ","

453,Jeff Reeves,3162017,MarketWatch,3092017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data.

But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general.

If you invest for income, collecting your dividends is the most important thing. You don't care what's going on in an industry or what the outlook is for the stock market. You want to get paid on time and, preferably, with regular dividend hikes thrown in the mix, too. If that sounds like you, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are two dividends stocks you'll love. Enterprise Products Partners is one of the largest midstream oil and gas players in the country. It uses its network of pipes, storage, and processing facilities to get those fuels from where they are drilled to where they are used. Here's the interesting thing: The vast majority of its business is fee-based. That means volatile energy prices aren't that important to Enterprise -- only demand for its pipes and facilities. Image source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. This helps explain why the partnership has been able to increase its distribution for 50 consecutive quarters (the annual streak, just so you know, is up to 20 years). That includes right through the deep oil downturn that started in mid-2014. Enterprise has also managed to keep an average coverage ratio of around 1.2 times of late, providing a layer of safety for its distribution. Enterprise continues to invest for the future. It has roughly $6.7 billion worth of projects under construction today. Those projects will come online between now and 2019 and will support further distribution growth. This industry giant and its generous 6% (or so) distribution yield is a great option for dividend investors who hate risk. ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest integrated oil and natural gas companies, is another energy player that should be on the income short list. It has a roughly 3.7% dividend yield and, more importantly, it has increased its dividend every year for the past 34 years. You might highlight Chevron Corp.'s (NYSE:CVX) 29 years and 4% yield as a better deal, but there's more to a dividend increase than there appears. Exxon increased its dividend in the second quarters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Chevron increased its dividend in the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 -- it held the dividend steady for 10 quarters, two and a half years, in between. But because of timing, Chevron's annual dividend streak remained intact. Exxon's regular yearly increases are the better option if you don't like risk. EPD Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Exxon is one of the most conservative and best-run oil majors. For example, its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of around 15% is at the low end of the industry. Sure, it has added debt to maintain its capital spending and dividend through the oil downturn, like most of its peers, but it is still conservatively financed. On the operational front, it has long been among the industry's best performers on return on invested capital. This metric measures how well a company invests its shareholders' money. Regular dividend hikes backed by a solid balance sheet and a well-run company. That's the kind of stock risk-averse investors could love, particularly since the yield is currently toward the high end of the company's historical range. Stock prices go up and down -- all investors know that. Dividend investors, though, know that those price swings often open up opportunities in dividend stocks that keep on paying in good times and bad. If you can step back from the stock price and focus, instead, on the dividend, your risk equation changes, and price volatility suddenly becomes an opportunity to own great dividend payers like ExxonMobil and Enterprise Products Partners. If you hate risk, you can easily take solace in the regular distributions this pair has continued to pay and grow despite one of the worst energy downturns in recent history. ","

The shocks to oil prices created by the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the revolution in Iran in 1979 had far reaching consequences that still affect investor thinking today. Analyzing the aftermath of the ensuing energy crisis and stagflation (high inflation with stagnant growth) leads to one key conclusion oil stock pickers need to be aware of: the demand for oil is not price inelastic. Price elasticity of demand simply means that as the price of a good goes up or down its demand will adjust accordingly -- usually as price goes down, demand goes up. Therefore, when oil perma-bulls make the commonly heard argument that oil demand is price inelastic, they are saying that as oil prices rise, demand will stay constant. Image source: Getty Images This is important because it implies that oil demand won't taper off and consumers won't start using alternatives -- a bullish argument for oil.However, the evidence from the aftermath of the energy crises is that demand, at least past the short-term, is actually price elastic. In other words, demand can go down as prices go up. As you can see below, oil prices dictate the direction of oil stocks. The chart shows oil prices alongside a leading energy ETF, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEMKT:XLE), which has ExxonMobile Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) as its largest holdings, along with a leading oil equipment and services ETF, the iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equip. (NYSEMKT:IEZ), which has Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) as its top two stocks. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Incidentally, there is a perfectly logical reason why oil services companies, like Schlumberger and Halliburton, should be more affected by spot oil price movements than oil exploration and production (E & P) companies (ExxonMobile and Chevron). Specifically, earnings at services companies are more dictated by near-term oil prices, which affect demand for oil field services, while E & P companies are better valued with their long-term oil reserves in the ground in mind, along with their exploration potential. The oil price shocks referenced above were dramatic by any measure. After adjusting for inflation, the Arab oil embargo crisis of 1973 saw oil prices jump from $20 to around $50 in no time -- an increase of 150% -- while the Iranian revolution led to an increase from around $55 to near $120 -- a near 120% increase. There are two arguments to suggest that the impact of these events had significant effects on demand. First, let's look at US motor vehicle fuel efficiency, a very important determinant of global oil demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates world oil demand in 2016 was 96.6 million barrels per day (mbpd), with the U.S. responsible for around 21%, and U.S. motor gasoline demand (9.3 mbpd) responsible for 9.6% of total world demand. The chart below shows how the crises spurred increases in fuel efficiency, with an inflexion in 1973 and a huge jump in 1979 -- evidence that higher oil prices will change thinking about fuel economy and reduce oil demand. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Logarithmic scale. The second chart shows energy inputs into electricity plants in the U.S. As you can see below, in 1971 oil products were the third largest contributor, but following the oil crises of the 1970s actions were taken to wean electricity production away from oil and toward coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Again, it's a demonstration of the fact that oil demand can readjust to higher prices -- oil products are pretty much irrelevant to U.S. electricity production now. Data source: International Energy Agency Headline Data. ktoe is kilotonne of oil equivalent The evidence from the actions taken following the energy crises suggests that oil demand isn't as price inelastic as many oil bulls may assume it to be -- a key concern if you are pricing in significant oil price increases in future. Moreover, given the importance of U.S. gasoline demand, and the fact that 70% of petroleum in the U.S. has been used for transportation in recent years, what happens to global oil demand if the U.S. embarks on a wide-scale shift to energy-efficient electric vehicles? Even if you are bullish on oil in the long-term -- and there is a case for emerging markets to propel demand -- it might make sense to balance risk by investing in stocks that benefit from trends like electrification of vehicles and the use of natural gas.

459,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"The sale of stakes in the Jotun, Balder and Ringhorne fields, along with some related production assets and properties, had long been rumored in local media. “It’s a natural part of business to assess whether such assets could be worth more to others than they are to us. We’ll remain a significant investor in Norway however,” Exxon spokesman Tore Revaa said. The fields sold had daily output of 54,000 barrels of oil equivalents in 2016, while Exxon’s remaining Norwegian stakes yielded about 170,000 barrels per day. Norwegian financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv, citing unnamed sources, said the deal was valued at close to 8 billion Norwegian crowns ($935 million). The companies declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Point Resources, which is majority owned by HitecVision, will have output of about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent following the deal, which could grow to about 80,000 barrels in 2022, it said in a separate statement. “Given the number of development plans and other opportunities, no redundancies are expected within the combined company as a result of the transaction,” it added. Following the deal, Point’s reserves and contingent resources will amount to about 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. The switch of ownership, which the companies hope to complete in the fourth quarter of 2017, must be approved by the Norwegian government. Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement the deal could bring more diversity and competition to the oil industry. “The transaction ... is exciting because it makes Point a significant player while Exxon Mobil remains a large producer,” he added.

460,,3302017,Reuters,3232017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas on Wednesday kicked an Exxon Mobil Corp lawsuit seeking to thwart two states from pursuing a fraud case over climate change to a Manhattan court, saying his court wasn’t the best place to resolve the dispute. A group of state attorneys general, led by New York’s Eric Schneiderman, brought a securities fraud suit against the world’s largest publicly traded oil company in 2015 claiming it  misled investors by soft-pedaling the dangers of climate change. Exxon criticized their case as intended to get the company and others in the oil and gas industry to change their positions on climate change. It responded with its own suit in U.S. District Court in Dallas. That suit argued the states conspired with climate activists to target Exxon and the states’ demands for documents dating back 40 years violated its rights to protection against unreasonable searches and were abusive. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade, who earlier sought to question Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey over Exxon’s claims the original fraud lawsuit was biased, ruled in favor of Healey and her New York counterpart. He wrote his court was not the proper venue because events at issue in the case took place in New York. But the judge’s decision questioned whether the two AGs “are trying to hide something,” citing an agreement with climate activists not to publicly discuss their contacts. He also said the agreement should be open to discovery by Exxon attorneys. Exxon had argued that the requests for documents were, as the judge summarized it, tools to cultivate the political goals of Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Despite having the case transferred to Manhattan, an Exxon spokesman said the company was gratified the judge agreed its “claims involve important issues,” adding: “We look forward to continuing the case in that court.” Healey also lauded the decision to move the case, saying “we will continue to argue that this frivolous lawsuit should be dismissed.” Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said in a statement that the judge’s remarks in the ruling were “riddled with factual errors and oil industry spin,” and said Exxon was free to make the same claims in New York but “so far, inexplicably have not done so.” The case is 4:16-cv-00469 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division.

461,Todd Shriber,3302017,Investopedia,3232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The legend of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), the stock, continues to grow. Shares of the e-commerce juggernaut jumped 2.1 percent to another record high Wednesday. As of March 28, Amazon – now home to a $418 billion market value – was the fifth largest holding in the S&P 500. On that date, Amazon trailed Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) by a single basis point in the benchmark U.S. equity index. Predictably, Amazon's ascent is benefiting some exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Excluding one brand new ETF, 14 ETFs hit record highs Wednesday. It is not a coincidence that two of these ETFs – the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF (FDIS) – feature large allocations to Amazon. Those are cap-weighted ETFs, and with Amazon being the largest consumer discretionary name by market value, XLY, FDIS and rival discretionary ETFs usually feature large weights to the stock. (See also: Amazon Hits All-Time High as Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Market Cap.) XLY's weight to Amazon is now about 13.7 percent, meaning that of the roughly 100 ETFs that feature exposure to the stock, perhaps as few as one have larger Amazon weights than XLY. Home to $11.9 billion in assets under management, XLY is the largest consumer discretionary ETF in the U.S. Meanwhile, with an annual fee of just 0.084 percent, FDIS has the honor of being the least expensive U.S. discretionary ETF. The Fidelity ETF is a credible Amazon play as well, with a weight of just over 11 percent to the stock. (See also: Invest in Consumer Discretionary With This ETF.) Shares of Seattle-based Amazon are up 16.6 percent year to date, and data suggest that some investors are turning to ETFs as avenues for exposure to the stock. XLY has added $330 million in new assets, while FDIS has seen inflows of $10.2 million. In the case of FDIS, that may not sound like much, but that is a decent percentage of the ETF's $263.4 million in assets (as of Feb. 28). Given Amazon's now massive market value and its 46 percent gain over the past year, it might be argued that upside from here will be hard to come by. However, Barclays initiated coverage of the stock Wednesday with an overweight rating and a price target of $1,120, speculating that Amazon's market value will one day top $1 trillion. The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN), the largest dedicated internet ETF, has added $40.3 million in new assets this year. Amazon is the second largest of FDN's 42 holdings at a weight of 8.42 percent. (See also: The One ETF to Own the Top Internet Company Stocks.)

The investment announced on Tuesday actually stemmed from a 2015 deal negotiated between Ford and the United Auto Workers union. Under that 2015 collective bargaining agreement, Ford committed itself to investing $9 billion in US plants with the expectation of creating or retaining 8,500 jobs across a number of states, including Michigan. ""The majority of what was announced today is part of the 2015 UAW contract,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker told BuzzFeed News via email. ""The $850 billion at Michigan Assembly Plant was part of the contract, as was the Romeo Engine Plant. The $200 million data center was not part of the UAW contract, but it wouldn't be because there are no hourly jobs at the data center."" When asked if the White House did anything during a meeting with automakers that may have led to the Michigan announcement, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, ""I think there's been some regulatory effort and some commitments on the regulatory efforts going forward in the future that I think may have played a role."" Felker also said that Ford reached out to the White House about its plans shortly before 8 a.m. ET — about 90 mins after Trump sent his tweet. Before he was even inaugurated as president, Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving to Mexico — but the  automaker had no plans of shuttering the factory. ""Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,"" Trump tweeted on Nov. 17. ""I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!"" While Ford had been planning to move the production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico, the company  said its Louisville plant was not set to close, or even lose any jobs, because of the expanded production of another vehicle, the Ford Escape. Instead, the Lincoln will now continue to be built in Kentucky. ""We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,"" a Ford statement from November said. In early March, Trump and his administration pointed to a $20 billion investment by oil giant ExxonMobil on the US Gulf Coast as proof they were ""bringing back the JOBS!"" @realDonaldTrump: There is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now—we're bringing back the JOBS! ""This is something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration having to do with regulation and so many other things,"" Trump said in a video address. ""I said we would bring back jobs. This is one example of it."" ""@POTUS promised to bring back jobs to America,"" Vice President Mike Pence tweeted. ""Today's news is further evidence of the country's spirit of optimism, boosting job growth."" @VP: .@POTUS promised to bring back jobs to America. Today's news is further evidence of the country's spirit of optimism, boosting job growth. But statements from both the White House and Exxon also contained the following important disclaimer about Exxon's Growing the Gulf program: ""Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022."" In an  Oval Office event on March 24, President Trump and Charter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge announced the company would invest $25 billion in the US and commit to hiring 20,000 American workers over four years. But in April 2016, the company had said it would hire 20,000 employees if regulators allowed it to purchase Time Warner Cable. The deal was approved and finalized last spring. ""We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company,"" Rutledge said on a company call in August. ""The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people."" On that same August call, Rutledge said the company was building a call center in McAllen, Texas — a facility Trump also pointed to in his Oval Office ""announcement"" in March. A Charter spokesperson  maintained to BuzzFeed News that while the company had previously spoken of ""plans"" to hire 20,000 new workers, it hadn't formally ""committed"" to doing so until this March. Speaking alongside President Trump  at the White House on Feb. 8, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced a $7 billion investment in a semiconductor factory in Chandler, Arizona, which he said would employ 3,000 high-wage workers as part of a total of more than 10,000 long-term jobs in the state. ""We're very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy,"" Trump said of Intel's announcement. But Krzanich first announced the Chandler factory, dubbed Fab 42, back in 2011 during a visit to an Intel facility by President Obama. Intel said then the company aimed to finish construction of the factory in 2013. ""Fab 42 was originally announced in 2011,"" a spokesperson for Intel told  BuzzFeed News in a statement. ""We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand. We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business."" During the presidential transition, the CEO of Japanese technology giant SoftBank  paid a visit to Trump Tower in New York City to announce meet with the then president-elect. Masayoshi Son, or ""Masa,"" announced a $50 billion US investment would create 50,000 jobs over four years. The money, he said, would come from a $100 billion fund he created with Saudi Arabia in  October 2016. ""Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"" Trump tweeted of the US investment. @realDonaldTrump: Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election! Many analysts, however, were skeptical of Trump's claim that SoftBank would not have invested in the US had he not won the election. ""Those billions were likely to end up in the US no matter who won,"" according to a  Wall Street Journal report. ""SoftBank announced the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund nearly a month before the election, when most pundits expected Mr. Trump to lose. Given its size, the fund was likely to put most of its money in the US, still home to the world's most-promising technology companies."" Jun Tanabe, who works at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo and analyses Soft Bank, told the  Washington Post he believed Masa was trying to build a good relationship with Trump. ""[Masa] must have intended as much as half of the Vision Fund to go to the US, as he's aware that there are great companies in Silicon Valley. But he chose this time to announce it as Trump is now going to be the next president,"" Tanabe said. Softbank, which owns Sprint and has invested in BuzzFeed, has pushed to have Sprint merge with T-Mobile to create a telecommunications company that could better compete with AT&T and Verizon. Such a merger would require approval from federal regulators. Matthew Zeitlin, Hamza Shaban, Claudia Koerner, and Salvador Hernandez contributed reporting.

Before he was even inaugurated as president, Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving to Mexico — but the  automaker had no plans of shuttering the factory. ""Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,"" Trump tweeted on Nov. 17. ""I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!"" While Ford had been planning to move the production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico, the company  said its Louisville plant was not set to close, or even lose any jobs, because of the expanded production of another vehicle, the Ford Escape. Instead, the Lincoln will now continue to be built in Kentucky. ""We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,"" a Ford statement from November said. In early March, Trump and his administration pointed to a $20 billion investment by oil giant ExxonMobil on the US Gulf Coast as proof they were ""bringing back the JOBS!"" @realDonaldTrump: There is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now—we're bringing back the JOBS! ""This is something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration having to do with regulation and so many other things,"" Trump said in a video address. ""I said we would bring back jobs. This is one example of it."" ""@POTUS promised to bring back jobs to America,"" Vice President Mike Pence tweeted. ""Today's news is further evidence of the country's spirit of optimism, boosting job growth."" @VP: .@POTUS promised to bring back jobs to America. Today's news is further evidence of the country's spirit of optimism, boosting job growth. But statements from both the White House and Exxon also contained the following important disclaimer about Exxon's Growing the Gulf program: ""Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022."" In an  Oval Office event on March 24, President Trump and Charter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge announced the company would invest $25 billion in the US and commit to hiring 20,000 American workers over four years. But in April 2016, the company had said it would hire 20,000 employees if regulators allowed it to purchase Time Warner Cable. The deal was approved and finalized last spring. ""We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company,"" Rutledge said on a company call in August. ""The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people."" On that same August call, Rutledge said the company was building a call center in McAllen, Texas — a facility Trump also pointed to in his Oval Office ""announcement"" in March. A Charter spokesperson  maintained to BuzzFeed News that while the company had previously spoken of ""plans"" to hire 20,000 new workers, it hadn't formally ""committed"" to doing so until this March. Speaking alongside President Trump  at the White House on Feb. 8, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced a $7 billion investment in a semiconductor factory in Chandler, Arizona, which he said would employ 3,000 high-wage workers as part of a total of more than 10,000 long-term jobs in the state. ""We're very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy,"" Trump said of Intel's announcement. But Krzanich first announced the Chandler factory, dubbed Fab 42, back in 2011 during a visit to an Intel facility by President Obama. Intel said then the company aimed to finish construction of the factory in 2013. ""Fab 42 was originally announced in 2011,"" a spokesperson for Intel told  BuzzFeed News in a statement. ""We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand. We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business."" During the presidential transition, the CEO of Japanese technology giant SoftBank  paid a visit to Trump Tower in New York City to announce meet with the then president-elect. Masayoshi Son, or ""Masa,"" announced a $50 billion US investment would create 50,000 jobs over four years. The money, he said, would come from a $100 billion fund he created with Saudi Arabia in  October 2016. ""Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"" Trump tweeted of the US investment. @realDonaldTrump: Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election! Many analysts, however, were skeptical of Trump's claim that SoftBank would not have invested in the US had he not won the election. ""Those billions were likely to end up in the US no matter who won,"" according to a  Wall Street Journal report. ""SoftBank announced the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund nearly a month before the election, when most pundits expected Mr. Trump to lose. Given its size, the fund was likely to put most of its money in the US, still home to the world's most-promising technology companies."" Jun Tanabe, who works at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo and analyses Soft Bank, told the  Washington Post he believed Masa was trying to build a good relationship with Trump. ""[Masa] must have intended as much as half of the Vision Fund to go to the US, as he's aware that there are great companies in Silicon Valley. But he chose this time to announce it as Trump is now going to be the next president,"" Tanabe said. Softbank, which owns Sprint and has invested in BuzzFeed, has pushed to have Sprint merge with T-Mobile to create a telecommunications company that could better compete with AT&T and Verizon. Such a merger would require approval from federal regulators. Matthew Zeitlin, Hamza Shaban, Claudia Koerner, and Salvador Hernandez contributed reporting.

For the fifth year in a row, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT), a company with an outsized physical store presence, has taken the top spot in Fortune magazine's ranking of the top 500 companies. The Arkansas-based company, which is also the world's largest retailer, reported revenue of $485.8 billion last year. That figure is more than double the $223.6 billion revenue of second-place company on the list, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A). With reported revenue of $215.6 billion, tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL) rounded out the top three. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) dropped two places from last year to the fourth position, and pharma company McKesson Corporation (MCK) placed fifth. (See also: Fact Sheet: What Is the Fortune 500 List?) In recent years, investor sentiment has turned bearish toward Wal-Mart's future growth largely because the company has been slow on the uptake as far as e-commerce is concerned. However, an outsized revenue is not a guarantee of overall profits. On an overall basis, Wal-Mart ranked 11th in profits. The top spot in that category was taken by Apple, which reported profits of $45.7 billion. (See also: Wal-Mart to Consolidate Buying Operations.) Healthcare and pharma firms accounted for three of the top 10 largest companies in America, according to Fortune.

465,Bob Pisani,6152017,CNBC,6082017,"For the second day in a row, value stocks (banks, energy) are outperforming growth stocks (technology). Has the time finally arrived for value stocks? Growth versus value is one of the oldest investment styles known. Value-buying stocks that are underpriced, according to some fundamental metric, such as price-to-book ratio, gained fame under Ben Graham and David Dodd, whose 1934 text ""Security Analysis"" is generally viewed as the bible of value investing, even though they never explicitly used the phrase ""value investing."" One thing is clear: buying growth stocks—those that are growing earnings at an above-average rate — has been a sound strategy this year. The iShares S&P Growth ETF (IVW) is up 12.5 percent year to date, while the iShares S&P Value (IVE) is up only 4.1 percent. Why is there such outperformance this year for growth? As a rule, growth stocks this year are technology, consumer discretionary, and health care. As a rule, value stocks this year are financials, energy, and consumer staples. It shouldn't surprise you that the reason growth has outperformed value is because of the huge outperformance of big-cap tech stocks. Here are the top holdings in the S&P Growth Index, by their weight in the index. S&P Growth: top holdingsApple: 7 percentMicrosoft: 4.8 percentAmazon: 3.4 percentFacebook: 3.1 percentGoogle: 2.6 percent These are the so-called ""FANG"" stocks (with Microsoft added) that everyone has been talking about this year. By contrast, the Value index's biggest names are energy and financials, which have all underperformed this year: For the past two days, we have seen a rotation out of tech outperformers and into energy and bank underperformers. This is a healthy sign: rather than just selling off, investors are using these over-owned technology names as a source of funds to buy underperforming energy and bank names. Will that continue? Opinions are divided. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, splits the difference by telling clients, ""We are not advising a style tilt at this point"" but notes the obvious: ""On a short-term basis, value's underperformance is moving to an extreme and due for a reprieve."" The good news is that the action in the past couple days is a good reminder that nothing goes in a straight line and the momentum guys can just as quickly abandon growth names, and have done so many times in the past. And growth does not have a monopoly on price appreciation: there are long periods when value does outperform. Lerner notes that while growth has outperformed value this year, growth underperformed value by 9 percent in 2016. ""Thus, over the entire period from 2016 until now, growth's outperformance is less extreme at less than 4%,"" Lerner notes. One final note: a common complaint about growth vs. value investing is that you get a lot of ""bleed,"" that is, because the parameters of what constitutes value and growth are a bit fuzzy, you can (and do) get stocks that have characteristics of both, so they are usually included in both indices. For example, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson are in both the Growth and Value indices. If this bothers you—that you can get the same stocks in two different investment styles that seem, well, opposite—you're not alone. There have been numerous attempts to create ""pure"" investment styles. Sticking with ETFs, one example is Guggenheim's S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) and S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) ETFs. Guggenheim splits the S&P into three groups: a growth basket that weights stocks on traditional growth fundamentals (sales and earnings growth, price momentum), a value basket that weights value stocks on traditional value fundamentals (price/book ratio, sales/price ratio, and earnings/price ratio), and a ""blend basket"" of stocks that have both growth & value attributes. It throws out the ""blend basket"" and creates funds that they believe how ""purer"" growth and value characteristics. The results? It sounds like a good idea, but at least this year there's not a huge difference between the performances of the S&P 500 Growth and Value and the ""Pure"" S&P 500 Growth and Value Indices: iShares S&P Growth (IVW) up 12.5 percentGuggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) up 12.8 percent iShares S&P Value (IVE) up 4.1 percent Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) up 3.8 percent The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people.

466,John Bromels,6152017,Fool,6082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Two stocks. One price. Any buys? Currently, shares of Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) are both sitting just below $47/share. Earlier this year, though, Apache's per-share price was above $60, and Anadarko's was above $70! Let's look at which one of these beaten-down energy industry stocks is likely to have better performance for investors. Both Apache and Anadarko are building up their oil and gas assets in Texas, hoping to benefit from lower production costs. Image source: Getty Images. Apache and Anadarko each released their first-quarter 2017 earnings report in early May. Both companies performed better than the prior year, which is hardly surprising considering how much oil prices have increased since then. The companies' biggest rival ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), for example, saw a billion-dollar year-over-year improvement in earnings in Q1. Despite these improvements, all three companies' stock prices have suffered since. Anadarko saw impressive sales volume growth during the quarter -- up a divestiture-adjusted 20% year over year. It was also able to enhance its product mix to 61% liquids versus 53% in the year-ago quarter. Because liquids command higher prices, this improved the company's overall margins. In spite of that, though, the company still didn't manage to turn a profit during the quarter, posting an adjusted $330 million loss. Apache, on the other hand, posted a small profit, but on lower volumes than in the year-ago quarter. (although that wasn't unexpected). Revenue and cash flow were both up, and the company is seeing better-than-expected results from its Alpine High play (more on that later). Nevertheless, the market had hoped for more, sending shares downward after the announcement. Both companies are clearly benefiting from an improved oil market, although there's still a long way to go. However, a profit beats a loss, so this one goes to Apache. Especially in the current environment, when stocks across the industry are down and with no clear recovery on the horizon, a dividend can be a godsend for investors. The regular payout a dividend provides can reward investors for their patience as they wait for share prices to recover. Both Anadarko and Apache pay a dividend, although Apache's is much more robust. In early 2014, both companies increased their dividend payouts. Anadarko upped its dividend to $0.27/share, while Apache raised its to an even $0.25/share. Of course, shortly thereafter, the bottom fell out of the oil market, and the entire industry started to suffer. Anadarko held its dividend at that level for nearly two years, but eventually, Anadarko's management -- wisely, in my opinion -- bit the bullet and slashed its dividend to just $0.05/share, where it remains today. Apache, on the other hand, has been able to keep its dividend steady at $0.25/share and doesn't seem likely to cut it -- or, for that matter, raise it -- anytime soon. That gives Apache an attractive current yield of about 2.1%. Which is close to best-in-class ConocoPhillips' 2.4% yield. Of course, some of the integrated majors, like ExxonMobil or Royal Dutch Shell yield far more or have a longer history of increases, but 2.1% is not bad, especially compared to Anadarko's tiny 0.4% yield. The importance of past earnings and current dividend yield, though, pale in importance to a company's future prospects and performance. And both Apache and Anadarko are undergoing some changes that could have a big impact on their upcoming operations. For Anadarko, the changes stem from an April explosion at a home in Colorado, which killed two people. Investigators discovered that an abandoned return flowline connected to a nearby Anadarko-owned well hadn't been properly capped. Gas from a cut in the pipeline seeped into the home, causing the blast. As a result, Anadarko -- Colorado's largest gas producer -- was ordered to inspect all of its wells located within 1,000 feet of buildings. Anadarko wrapped up those inspections in early June and submitted a report to the state, but it's still unclear what further actions -- if any -- Anadarko might have to take. And of course, there are almost certain to be legal ramifications. Apache, on the other hand, is busily developing the infrastructure at its monster Alpine High find in the Delaware Basin of Texas. The area around the find had been ignored by the industry until recently, so Apache is basically starting from scratch, but it's currently ahead of schedule and under budget. The company estimates production won't be able to start in earnest until the second half of 2017, and it won't really take off until 2018. In the meantime, the infrastructure development coupled with some scheduled maintenance downtime in the company's North Sea operations is going to make for lackluster performance. The near-term outlook is uncertain for both companies -- particularly with oil prices dropping again. However, there's still a lot we don't know about Anadarko's Colorado operations and how the company will be affected overall. Apache's position -- sitting on a huge oil and gas find and just needing to build out some infrastructure -- seems much more secure. Apache may not have had the best performance so far this year, but it pays a nice dividend and has excellent prospects for growth once its Alpine High find comes online. In fact, these factors convinced me to put my own money into the stock in May. However, if things in Colorado can be resolved quickly for Anadarko, and if it can start turning a profit from its record production, it could still be worth a look. Today, though, Apache is the clear winner. ","

467,Reuben Gregg Brewer,6152017,Fool,6082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In early 2017, discussions between BHP Billiton Limited (NYSE:BHP) and Elliott Management spilled out into the open. The activist investor is looking for BHP to make changes that it believes will enhance shareholder value, most notably spinning off the miner's oil business. Elliott has had success cajoling other companies to actions lately, notably metal parts maker Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), which means investors should be asking what will happen to BHP Billiton's oil business. Elliott has three main requests of BHP. The first is to simplify its corporate structure, which involves dual shares, buying back $6 billion worth of stock, and spinning off the company's oil business. BHP is pushing back on all three, suggesting that the company's unique corporate structure isn't an impediment to its business, it's not the right time to spend so much on share buybacks, and that the oil business is a good fit for BHP. Image source: Getty Images. The demands are notable because of Elliott Management's track record. For example, it recently got into a public spat with Arconic. In that case the dissident investor was looking for the ouster of the CEO and additional board seats. In the end, Arconic's CEO left the company and Elliott and Arconic came to terms about the board without having to resort to a disputed shareholder vote. Elliott also took on technology giant Samsung. In this case it wanted Samsung to restructure its business as a holding company. Although Elliott didn't get what it wanted, Samsung did agree to cancel treasury shares and to start paying a dividend. I count that as another broad win. BHP doesn't like Elliott's ideas very much. Image source: BHP Billiton. So it's legitimate to wonder how long BHP can resist with Elliott pushing for change. Saying no to changing the dual corporate structure is relatively easy. Making that change would be technically difficult, time consuming, and would require regulatory approval. It's probably not worth the effort since the current structure hasn't really been much of an impediment so far. Share buybacks on the scale that Elliott is asking, meanwhile, would require BHP to use roughly 40% of the cash it has on its balance sheet or the issuance of new debt. It could easily afford the expense, but BHP says it would rather have additional balance sheet flexibility right now. I'm willing to take management at its word on this one, but it's probably not a big deal either way. The last requested change, however, is a big one: Jettisoning the oil business. Elliott makes a good case for a spin-off. For example, drilling for oil is a different business than mining iron ore, copper, and metallurgical coal. BHP suggests that its knowledge of geology gives it an edge here. I'm not so sure being that it competes with oil industry giants like ExxonMobil. Oil is a big part of BHP's future, for now. Image source: BHP Billiton. That said, the company's oil assets do separate it from competitors like Rio Tinto plc and Vale SA that don't drill for oil. It clearly gives BHP a unique level of diversification. And oil is a big business for BHP, accounting for around 20% of underlying EBITDA through the first six months of the current fiscal year. Moreover, over the last five years the oil business' EBITDA margin exceeded that of all of its mining segments. This is a notable and profitable business and BHP has big plans for it. BHP, however, can't claim that its oil business has been a perfect investment. In early 2016 it announced it was writing down the value of its U.S. shale oil assets by roughly $7 billion. Adding that to earlier write-offs brings the total to around $13 billion on roughly $20 billion in investments in the U.S. shale space. Clearly, Elliott can easily point to mistakes that have been made that suggest BHP shouldn't be in the oil business. But that's just one part of the company's oil portfolio and BHP has started looking at ""alternatives"" for its U.S. shale operations. The rest of the oil business, however, isn't included in this process. It appears that BHP is hoping to give Elliott a little something so it doesn't have to give the dissident shareholder everything it wants. For now, based on BHP's pushback against Elliott, getting out of the U.S. shale business is probably all that investors should expect to see happen in BHP's oil business. At the end of the day, that's probably not a bad thing. BHP just went through a huge spin off, jettisoning assets into South32 in early 2015. That means it's still only a couple of years removed from its last big makeover. That's not really enough time to assess if the new focus is working. And commodities are only just starting to show signs of strength, including oil, which has lifted off its lows of around $30 a barrel to hit the $50 area. It's also important to remember that the oil assets aren't exactly going anywhere. So BHP can spin them off at a later date just as well as it could spin them off today -- why rush into a new spin off so soon? Fine tuning the oil business seems like a more prudent move at this point. With BHP clearly willing to defend its position, I wouldn't expect much more than that for now. ","

But in naming the 55-year old executive as the replacement for GE CEO Jeff Immelt starting in August, GE turned to someone who is deeply familiar with the various parts of the complex company that is in the midst of tumultuous changes. Flannery joined GE in 1987, working as an analyst evaluating GE's risk in using debt to buy new businesses. He then took on a various finance-related jobs, including a stint as a leader in the corporate restructuring and workout group and business development. RELATED: GE CEO Jeff Immelt stepping down, John Flannery to take over role General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt: We're seeing 'end of the global elite' GE profit falls, but 'more optimistic' as Trump arrives A year after Immelt took over as CEO in 2001, he dispatched Flannery to head other positions where he's had to repeatedly prove and display his investment acumen. Flannery took over as the chief of GE's private equity group and was given expanded roles in the financial services unit, GE Capital, which was eventually sold. Starting 2005, he led the Asia Pacific region for GE Capital. During his tenure in Asia, GE Capital's profit in Japan doubled and grew 35% in Korea. Four years later, he moved to India, a key emerging market where he focused on growing its industrial business. Flannery's assignment to India was partly made to see what ""he can do globally"" and Immelt was impressed by his ability to expand local business contacts quickly, Immelt said. With a majority of GE's revenue now coming from abroad, Flannery's global exposure ultimately gave him an edge in winning the CEO job, Immelt said. ""I've had opportunity to see John do five jobs,"" Immelt said during an employee meeting Monday, adding Flannery also had once been in his ""doghouse."" ""He’s the perfect person to run this company,"" Immelt said. After returning to the U.S., Flannery moved up quickly on the business development side, tasked with how best to invest GE's funds. In 2015, he led the $10 billion acquisition of Alstom, the largest industrial acquisition in GE's history. He also was directly involved in shrinking or eliminating GE's financial services businesses, which Immelt identified as not being aligned with future growth opportunities. He soon took over GE Healthcare, an $18 billion business. Co-founded by inventor Thomas Edison, GE has a rich legacy of rigorous leadership and succession planning and has frequently touted its emphasis on spotting and nurturing management talent. And Immelt's ascension in 2001 came after a heated internal competition closely monitored by his predecessor, Jack Welch. Flannery was something of a dark horse candidate. Even as Flannery led one of GE's largest business units, his name didn't rise immediately as a potential replacement for Immelt. GE CFO Jeff Bornstein, GE Power division chief Steve Bolze and GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli were frequently mentioned as possible candidates. But Flannery began to emerge quickly in recent months among company watchers, said Gautam Khanna, an industry analyst at financial services firm Cowen. The process of selecting the new CEO was noticeably more muted this time around than 16 years ago, noted Michael Useem, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""By having it more muted and more inside-ballpark, the directors and Immelt can do a better job vetting the candidates. Having a public bake-off...becomes a spectacle,"" he said. In a conference call, Flannery told investors that he will focus on comprehensively reviewing the company's assets in the next few weeks before revealing his strategy in September. But ""cost structure and cash flow"" are among the areas he's looking to focus on, he said. GE has undergone painful rounds of cost-cutting, shedding about $7 billion in costs in recent years. ""I'd suspect there is some incremental costs to cut,"" Khanna said. ""He may also look harder at spending on the digital side."" Flannery, whose dog is named ""Mookie"" (after Boston Red Sox player Mookie Betts), plans to move to Boston to work from GE's headquarters. He graduated from Fairfield University in Connecticut and earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Follow USA TODAY reporter Roger Yu on Twitter @ByRogerYu.

471,,6222017,Reuters,6152017,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it and partners would spend $4.4 billion to develop part of the Liza oilfield off the coast of Guyana, approving a megaproject at a time when the oil industry has grown obsessed with lower-cost shale. Exxon’s decision shows that oil companies remain interested in large projects, especially offshore, even in an era of belt-tightening after two years of low crude prices. The Guyana announcement from Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC was the fifth deepwater project to gain approvals this year. BP Plc  and Reliance Industries said on Thursday they would spend $6 billion to develop natural gas reserves off the Indian coast. Exxon, which spent nearly $7 billion earlier this year to more than double its holdings in the Permian shale formation in the United States, said the Guyana project was approved due in part to its low cost of production. “We’re excited about the tremendous potential of the Liza field and accelerating first production through a phased development in this lower cost environment,” Liam Mallon, Exxon’s head of development, said in a statement. Phase One of the Liza development project should tap about 450 million barrels of oil and pump about 120,000 barrels per day when it comes online in 2020, Exxon said in a statement. The Liza field is roughly 190 kilometers off the coast of Guyana. Exxon plans 17 wells as part of the project’s first phase. A second phase is possible in the future, the company said. New York-based Hess said it expects its share of the project’s cost to be about $955 million. Shares of Exxon rose 0.7 percent to $82.97 on Friday. ","

472,,6222017,Reuters,6152017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Synthetic Genomics Inc said on Monday they had found a way to more than double the amount of lipids produced by algae in a lab, moving a potential alternative to fossil fuels closer to commercial viability. The development comes as Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels. In the past decade, Exxon has boosted investment in fuel cells, biodiesel, algae and other alternative energy technologies, in collaboration with private partners. The company also has invested in television advertisements to tout its renewable energy investments, including during last summer’s Olympic Games. “Algae can be a viable, renewable source for volumes of oil at scale,” said Vijay Swarup, Exxon’s vice president for research and development. “We like algae because it’s fast-growing, doesn’t compete for food and water and can grow in all sorts of climates and brackish water.” Exxon and Synthetic cautioned that they are far from being able to run the process at commercial scale. The oil company’s ultimate goal is to make an oil from algae that can be processed by existing refineries, though that goal remains elusive. Exxon began working with California-based Synthetic on algae research in 2009. The lab work is conducted at Synthetic facilities and funded by Exxon, which declined to disclose its financial investment. Scientists studied the way that algae cells partition carbon - typically from carbon dioxide - and produce lipids, a kind of hydrocarbon. Algae converts carbon dioxide into lipids much in the same way the human body converts sugar into fat. The scientists were able to genetically modify algae to convert 40 percent of CO2 into lipids, up from a prior 15 percent. “This was not an overnight breakthrough. This was a lot of sweat and toil,” said Craig Venter, chairman of Synthetic Genomics. Up next, scientists will need to unlock how to speed up the process and strengthen the algae cells. “This just gives us hope and optimism that we’re on the right track,” said Swarup. ","

473,Tom DiChristopher,6222017,CNBC,6152017,"Pittsburgh-based EQT Corp. is poised to become the largest producer of natural gas in the United States after announcing it will acquire fellow shale driller Rice Energy. EQT announced on Monday it will buy all of Rice Energy's shares in a deal worth $6.7 billion. After closing, EQT's output will total 3.6 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, topping U.S. production by oil major Exxon Mobil and shale drilling pioneer Chesapeake Energy. Shares of EQT Corp. were down about 9 percent to $53.51 on Monday. Rice Energy's stock price soared nearly 25 percent to $24.57 a share. The acquisition extends EQT's footprint in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. The area underlying Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia is the epicenter of a boom in American natural gas produced through hydraulic fracturing, the process of injecting water, minerals and chemicals underground to free oil and gas from rock formations. ""This transaction brings together two of the top Marcellus and Utica producers to form a natural gas operating position that will be unmatched in the industry,"" EQT President and CEO Steve Schlotterbeck said in a statement. EQT expects the deal to close in the final quarter of this year. Most of the acreage EQT will acquire from Rice is contiguous to its existing holdings, so it will be able to produce more efficiently through horizontal drilling, the company said. This means EQT needs to drill fewer vertical wells because it can drill sideways into neighboring pockets of natural gas. EQT appears to be ""empire building,"" and it's unlikely another driller will submit a successful bid for Rice, according to Mizuho Securities. That is because EQT's footprint overlaps with Rice's in southwestern Pennsylvania and the two companies have similar midstream operations, which focus on transporting natural gas through the Appalachian region, according to Mizuho. As part of the deal, EQT will acquire Rice's 92 percent interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings. EQT already owns a 90 percent limited partner interest in EQT GP Holdings, which also operates transportation infrastructure through EQT Midstream Partners.

Or that Ben Carson — neurosurgeon, controversial former presidential candidate and now secretary of Housing and Urban Development — stands 13th in line to replace President Donald Trump if he dies, resigns or is removed from office? The transportation secretary is 14th in line, but since Elaine Chao is a naturalized U.S. citizen — not born in the United States — she is ineligible. Amid the continuing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, there, of course, has been a great deal of discussion and news coverage of the 45th commander in chief not completing his full term in office. If a sitting president leaves office, the vice president — currently Mike Pence — becomes president for the rest of the term. If he is unable to serve, the next person in the line of succession acts as president (see the chart below). To date, only a vice president has ever replaced the president. The second in line, after Pence, is House Speaker Paul Ryan. And that oilman, who would follow Ryan and then Senate President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch, into the West Wing? That would be Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. American presidential succession laws date to 1792. The line of succession has been shuffled several times, including in 1868, when Congress removed the leaders of the Senate and House from the list, and, most recently, in 1967.

475,Reuben Gregg Brewer,6222017,Fool,6152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. International oil major Eni SpA (NYSE:E) has a huge 8.4% dividend yield, more than double ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield. But that fat yield doesn't make Eni the better dividend stock. To be fair, there are reasons to like Eni beyond the dividend yield, including the huge opportunities presented by its Zohr project in Egypt and its Mozambique natural gas fields. But despite some positives, here are three reasons why ExxonMobil is a better choice for dividend investors than higher yielding Eni. At the end of the first quarter long-term debt made up 28% of Eni's capital structure. That's not an unreasonable level of debt by any means. However, Eni's core business is selling a commodity subject to often large and sudden price swings. Which is exactly what happened in mid-2014 when oil fell from over $100 a barrel to the $30 a barrel area at the worst of the decline. Oil prices have moved higher since that point, hovering in the $40 to $50 per barrel range lately, but it's still well off its highs. Image source: Getty Images. Exxon's long-term debt makes up just 12% of its capital structure. That gives the oil giant a material amount of flexibility that Eni just doesn't have. In fact, Exxon has made extensive use of its balance sheet strength during the downturn to support its business and dividend.  At the start of 2014, long-term debt was roughly 5% of the capital structure. Eni's long-term debt, for comparison, was around 26% of its capital structure at the start of 2014... Clearly Eni didn't have the same capacity to support its business with debt, and still doesn't. Which helps explain why Eni sold a stake in its Mozambique gas field to Exxon. And why it partnered up with BP on the Zohr project. Basically, you can get a piece of Eni's high profile projects without buying Eni and it's heavy debt load. In my opinion, Exxon's solid balance sheet is the better option. The next reason to prefer Exxon over Eni is the basic business of each company. Exxon is a truly integrated oil major, with oil and natural gas drilling balanced against its chemicals and refining assets. To highlight the benefit of this, Exxon's earnings after income taxes fell by roughly 50% in 2015, a really bad year for all oil companies. But earnings at its chemicals business were up slightly year over year and its downstream earnings more than doubled, as refining benefited from falling oil prices. That helped offset the massive 75% drop in earnings from its upstream oil and gas drilling business. In fact, the downstream business earned almost as much on an absolute basis as the upstream business that year. This balanced approach allowed Exxon to report a profit for the full year. Now compare that to Eni, which has a diversified business but is more heavily weighted toward exploration and production. Adjusted net profit in 2015 fell a massive 90%, with asset write downs pushing the company's earnings deep into the red. It simply didn't have the balance to offset the decline on the oil and natural gas side of the business. To give you an idea of the scale of the problem, in 2015 adjusted earnings in the downstream business totaled 387 million euro compared to the 4.1 billion euro provided by the upstream segment. In other words, when Eni needed diversification its downstream business was little more than a rounding error. I'll take Exxon's truly diversified business, thanks. If Eni's big yield attracted you to the name, then step back and take a look at the company's dividend history. Between 2014 and 2015 it cut the dividend roughly 30%. Essentially, at the first sign of trouble shareholders took a dividend haircut. When you look at Eni's leverage relative to Exxon and the relative lack of diversification in its business you can see why that decision was made. And it was probably the right move for the company. However, if you were relying on those dividend checks, the cut would have hurt. At this point you shouldn't look at Eni's dividend as secure in any environment. (Note that currency fluctuations have recently pushed Eni's dividend even lower in dollar terms, in euros it has remained at the same level since the cut.) E Dividend Per Share (Annual) data by YCharts. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, used its balance sheet strength and truly diversified business model to keep rewarding investors with annual dividend increases each year through the downturn. The company's annual streak is now up to 35 consecutive years, making Exxon a dividend aristocrat. Recent hikes have been more modest than historical increases, but that's to be expected in a difficult industry environment. The real point is that Exxon wins hands down compared to Eni when it comes to returning value to shareholders via a consistently growing dividend. Eni offers investors a massive yield right now. But once you look past that, the positives at the oil giant just don't offset the negatives. Eni has less financial flexibility than Exxon, a less than inspiring dividend track record on an absolute and relative basis, and it lacks the diversification that Exxon's business offers -- a difference that showed up notably in 2015 when Eni chose to trim its dividend. Exxon has proven its dividend commitment for 35 consecutive years and despite the relatively low yield, I'd rather own Exxon than Eni any day. ","

477,,6292017,Reuters,6222017,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Investors are slowly starting to push companies to reduce their carbon footprint and help the world meet targets on limiting global warming that were agreed in the 2015 Paris climate talks. Energy firms have faced shareholder demands to do more to curb carbon emissions, while some pension funds are demanding more commitment to climate goals from firms they invest in. Yet progress has still been modest since the Paris deal agreed by almost 200 nations came into force in November last year, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. “Lots of investors are looking to align their investments with a 2 degrees world. It’s just at what pace they all get there,” said Fiona Reynolds, managing director at the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Advocates of the climate deal hope new impetus will come from Thursday’s document published by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a group set up by G20 nations. The task force’s document outlines a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, drawing support from more than 100 companies with $11 trillion of assets. It aims to help investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders understand how firms manage climate risk and guide companies on information they should provide to explain their climate strategy, ultimately helping ensure corporate laggards are held to account. “The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement,” said Philippe Desfossés, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP. Sweden’s largest national pension fund AP7 set a high benchmark in June when it named six companies it said had breached the Paris accord, and ditched them from its portfolio. Several energy firms have faced shareholder rebellions at annual general meetings over their stance on climate change. ExxonMobil XON.N has been accused of misleading investors by a U.S. prosecutor, allegations the U.S. firm has dismissed as “frivolous”. Many energy firms have been sharing more information on their climate strategies, and some mining companies are starting to follow suit, such as iron ore miner Vale VALE5.SA. In a Reuters survey, 13 leading public and corporate pension schemes in Europe, Asia and North America managing a total $1.1 trillion said they were committed to engaging firms on their climate strategy. Three of those funds said explicitly that divestment was an option if talks were unsatisfactory. However, some funds said the threat of divestment was not the best approach to encouraging firms to improve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. “We think engagement investment is about promoting companies to be involved with ESG through engagement,” said Hiroichi Yagi, an adviser to the pension fund of Japan’s Secom, a leading security firm. “If you just sell and stop investing in companies that are not mindful of climate change, then you are abandoning engagement there,” he said, adding that he was not aware of any Japanese pension funds advocating divestment as an option. To date, most divestments have tended to be from companies mining coal, the dirtiest energy source. Some large investors, such as Norway’s $960-billion sovereign wealth fund, have set limits on how much revenues can come from that source. The most active asset owners on climate change have tended to be big pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds - Norway’s and New Zealand’s have reduced exposure to fossil fuels. Such firms have more in-house analysts to assess investments. Smaller funds are making slower progress in pushing climate issues up the agenda in determining investment policy. A survey by consultants Mercer of 1,241 European pension schemes, half of which had less than 100 million euros ($114 million) in assets, showed just 5 percent considered the financial impact of climate change on their portfolios. However, that was up from 4 percent a year earlier. “It’s ironic that the pace of response to this enormous issue is best described as glacial, outside a small group of leading funds,” said Phil Edwards, Mercer’s Global Director of Strategic Research, calling for more “urgency” to be applied. Advocates of the Paris accord hope the TFCD’s framework document will particularly assist smaller firms. Britain’s Environment Agency Protection Fund, a founder member of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) that aims to help asset owners assess firms, said more than 3 trillion pounds  ($3.9 trillion) of assets were now being invested using the TPI’s guidelines. “We are aiming to be one of the first asset owners to do this to show our support for the TCFD and its pick up by other asset owners,” said Faith Ward, the scheme’s chief responsible investment officer. She said her fund planned to link its annual report to the TCFD framework. ","

(AAPL). According to Calcbench, a research firm that analyzes financial data from the SEC, Apple has averaged $107.1 million in share repurchases daily since initiating its stock buyback program in August 2012. In sum, this means that the company has purchased $142 billion worth of its own stock during that period. For context, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), which is the second biggest purchaser of its own stock, averaged $42.4 million of stock repurchases per day and spent a total of $55.88 billion for the initiative between 2012 and 2017. In its latest earnings report, Apple announced that it had spent $151 billion on stock repurchases since August 2012. Its pace of buybacks has accelerated since 2015, when it had purchased $80 billion worth of its own stock from shareholders. Apple also announced during its latest earnings call that it was planning to increase its share repurchase program to $210 billion from the year-ago level of $175 billion. (See also: Why Would a Company Buy Back Its Own Shares?) The Cupertino, California-based company's stock price has appreciated by 68% from 2012 to 2017, after adjusting for a stock split that occurred in 2014. Share repurchases increase the value of outstanding shares because the total number of shares available decreases even as their price remains the same. For example, Apple had 6.6 billion of its shares trading in the markets in 2013. As of this May, that number is down to 5.2 billion. According to some estimates, the decline in the number of shares has translated to a 21% bump in earnings per share for the company. (For more on Apple's history of stock splits, check out: If You Had Invested Right After Apple's IPO.) Much of Apple's share repurchase program is financed from its overseas cash pile. Of the company's $250 billion in cash, 90% is estimated to be parked abroad. In recent times, criticism has mounted against the company for failing to make acquisitions of innovative startups or invest in improving its innovation track record through the use of its cash. Critics have charged the company with ""financial engineering"" through stock buybacks to boost its bottom line, especially in the face of declining enthusiasm for its iconic iPhone.

479,"Scott Stringer, Comptroller of New York City",6292017,CNBC,6222017,"At the upcoming G20 summit, world leaders will have their work cut out for them. But one topic is particularly primed for action: climate change. With President Trump withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever that the G20 take action to fight climate change. Because at the end of the day, this is a global crisis — and it demands a global solution. If the White House won't lead on the climate it's going to be up to the rest of the world to do just that. The G20 has an important role to play — from continuing to support and implement the Paris Agreement, to driving investment in the low-carbon economy, to improving corporate disclosure of climate change related risks. That last step — climate change risk disclosure — may not sound Earth-shattering, but it can play a crucial role in the fight against global warming. Right now, however, most companies have stayed silent and refused to take that step. But as anyone in the business world knows, when there's more information, markets work better. And ultimately, outcomes improve. That means transparency yields stronger investments and helps us create a greener planet. It's not a market standard today — but the G20 could change that soon. This week, the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures — formed in 2015 at the request of the G20 to study this issue — will release its recommendations, which will be presented to the full G20 in July. The recommendations will cover everything from board oversight of climate issues — which we at the New York City Pension Funds have focused on for years — to standardizing the metrics used to manage climate issues. Perhaps most important, the task force will encourage every company to disclose how their businesses, strategies, and financial planning would fare in world where warming is limited to 2-degrees Celsius or less. This process — known as ""scenario analysis"" — is a  key step to understanding how transitioning to a low-carbon world would impact a company's long-term financial health. In other words, when it comes to transparency about climate change, the G20 meeting in Hamburg could be the dawn of a new era. For decades, institutional investors have pushed companies to recalibrate their strategies and prepare for a low-carbon world. The New York City Pension Funds have worked with groups like the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk and Sustainability — a coalition of 130 members who collectively manage over $17 trillion in assets — to make a difference. And this year marked a historic shift. Resolutions calling on  ExxonMobil and  Occidental Petroleum to analyze what a low-carbon future means for them received unprecedented majority investor support. I'm proud that the New York City Pension Funds co-filed these resolutions — and also supported a similar resolution which passed at electric utility PPL Corporation. Across the business world, leaders are coalescing around these climate change disclosures. Consulting firms McKinsey and Deloitte — along with credit ratings company Moody's — have publicly endorsed them. Large asset managers like BlackRock are on board. And CEOs of dozens of companies have  urged G20 governments to formally accept the task force's recommendations. These are all steps in the right direction — but given the link between task force's recommendations and avoiding the dangers of climate change, we must do more. With the release of the recommendations and the G20 meeting approaching, there's a chance for scenario analysis and climate change disclosure to take a leap toward becoming a market standard. That means more corporate and investor voices are needed. With more than 2,000 companies, investors, universities, states and cities that have pledged to continue to support climate action, now we all need to stand up for corporate transparency, forward-thinking planning, and a greener planet. When it comes to climate change disclosure, we need to  stand together and be visionaries. This isn't disclosure for disclosure's sake. It's about protecting our investments — and our planet — for generations to come.

480,Reuben Gregg Brewer,6292017,Fool,6222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. International oil major Eni SpA (NYSE:E) has a huge 8.4% dividend yield, more than double ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield. But that fat yield doesn't make Eni the better dividend stock. To be fair, there are reasons to like Eni beyond the dividend yield, including the huge opportunities presented by its Zohr project in Egypt and its Mozambique natural gas fields. But despite some positives, here are three reasons why ExxonMobil is a better choice for dividend investors than higher yielding Eni. At the end of the first quarter long-term debt made up 28% of Eni's capital structure. That's not an unreasonable level of debt by any means. However, Eni's core business is selling a commodity subject to often large and sudden price swings. Which is exactly what happened in mid-2014 when oil fell from over $100 a barrel to the $30 a barrel area at the worst of the decline. Oil prices have moved higher since that point, hovering in the $40 to $50 per barrel range lately, but it's still well off its highs. Image source: Getty Images. Exxon's long-term debt makes up just 12% of its capital structure. That gives the oil giant a material amount of flexibility that Eni just doesn't have. In fact, Exxon has made extensive use of its balance sheet strength during the downturn to support its business and dividend.  At the start of 2014, long-term debt was roughly 5% of the capital structure. Eni's long-term debt, for comparison, was around 26% of its capital structure at the start of 2014... Clearly Eni didn't have the same capacity to support its business with debt, and still doesn't. Which helps explain why Eni sold a stake in its Mozambique gas field to Exxon. And why it partnered up with BP on the Zohr project. Basically, you can get a piece of Eni's high profile projects without buying Eni and it's heavy debt load. In my opinion, Exxon's solid balance sheet is the better option. The next reason to prefer Exxon over Eni is the basic business of each company. Exxon is a truly integrated oil major, with oil and natural gas drilling balanced against its chemicals and refining assets. To highlight the benefit of this, Exxon's earnings after income taxes fell by roughly 50% in 2015, a really bad year for all oil companies. But earnings at its chemicals business were up slightly year over year and its downstream earnings more than doubled, as refining benefited from falling oil prices. That helped offset the massive 75% drop in earnings from its upstream oil and gas drilling business. In fact, the downstream business earned almost as much on an absolute basis as the upstream business that year. This balanced approach allowed Exxon to report a profit for the full year. Now compare that to Eni, which has a diversified business but is more heavily weighted toward exploration and production. Adjusted net profit in 2015 fell a massive 90%, with asset write downs pushing the company's earnings deep into the red. It simply didn't have the balance to offset the decline on the oil and natural gas side of the business. To give you an idea of the scale of the problem, in 2015 adjusted earnings in the downstream business totaled 387 million euro compared to the 4.1 billion euro provided by the upstream segment. In other words, when Eni needed diversification its downstream business was little more than a rounding error. I'll take Exxon's truly diversified business, thanks. If Eni's big yield attracted you to the name, then step back and take a look at the company's dividend history. Between 2014 and 2015 it cut the dividend roughly 30%. Essentially, at the first sign of trouble shareholders took a dividend haircut. When you look at Eni's leverage relative to Exxon and the relative lack of diversification in its business you can see why that decision was made. And it was probably the right move for the company. However, if you were relying on those dividend checks, the cut would have hurt. At this point you shouldn't look at Eni's dividend as secure in any environment. (Note that currency fluctuations have recently pushed Eni's dividend even lower in dollar terms, in euros it has remained at the same level since the cut.) E Dividend Per Share (Annual) data by YCharts. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, used its balance sheet strength and truly diversified business model to keep rewarding investors with annual dividend increases each year through the downturn. The company's annual streak is now up to 35 consecutive years, making Exxon a dividend aristocrat. Recent hikes have been more modest than historical increases, but that's to be expected in a difficult industry environment. The real point is that Exxon wins hands down compared to Eni when it comes to returning value to shareholders via a consistently growing dividend. Eni offers investors a massive yield right now. But once you look past that, the positives at the oil giant just don't offset the negatives. Eni has less financial flexibility than Exxon, a less than inspiring dividend track record on an absolute and relative basis, and it lacks the diversification that Exxon's business offers -- a difference that showed up notably in 2015 when Eni chose to trim its dividend. Exxon has proven its dividend commitment for 35 consecutive years and despite the relatively low yield, I'd rather own Exxon than Eni any day. ","

                                   Rumors involved Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP as buyers surfaced. There seemed to be a very nice fit given the mass of reserves of Chesapeake Energy, and the price of oil and natural gas at the time obviously helped valuation calculations. But everything changed when oil prices collapsed in 2014. Suddenly, instead of appearing to be a takeover target, Chesapeake Energy was trying desperately to produce profitably and to even survive. Just one a year ago, it appeared to be on the verge of bankruptcy. Since then, however, Chesapeake and the rest of the industry has figured out how to produce oil at lower costs and are once again competitive. This has been frustrating to OPEC, which is attempting to stabilize oil prices through production cuts. On Monday, Chesapeake Energy’s president told a J.P. Morgan Chase conference that “the financial strength of the company ... is better than it’s ever been before.” In that case, maybe Chesapeake Energy should go back on lists of potential buyout targets. Based on proven reserves and current oil prices, Chesapeake Energy has assets totaling over $80 billion, and its stock-market value is just $4.33 billion. There’s also approximately $9 billion in debt. So any buyout today likely would cost roughly $15 billion. When looking at the proven reserves vs. the cost of an acquisition, the general numbers start to look attractive. But that’s not the whole picture. For three consecutive quarters, Chesapeake Energy has produced positive earnings, with first-quarter earnings hitting 23 cents a share, up from 7 cents in the previous quarter. Analysts are currently expecting the company to earn approximately 85 cents per share this year, and $1.09 per share next year. That means the shares are trading near 4.4 times 2018 earnings. Granted, the past lingers for any company that was on the verge of bankruptcy as recently as a year ago. For any potential suitor, however, knowing that the company is in good financial condition is reason enough to open their eyes. Given the valuation metrics that currently exist, and assuming that the company is in as good a financial condition as expressed on Monday, what until recently was an ugly duckling may suddenly be appealing to any large industry player looking to acquire a shale producer on the cheap.

Source: Getty Images. If you could go back to the pre-industrial days of the 18th century, you'd see many things made of wood and stone and metal but nothing made of plastic. Today you can't get away from plastic if you tried. So, if you're thinking about investing in materials, why not invest in one with a history of growth and a stellar outlook? Plastic has conquered the world so thoroughly that it's difficult to actually define the plastic industry, as it has considerable overlap with the chemicals, energy, packaging, and consumer goods sectors. So let's consider only businesses that sell plastic to other businesses and exclude companies that use tons of plastic but are really in the consumer-goods sector. Here's a list of the largest publicly traded plastics manufacturers: Source: Yahoo Finance. The dirty secret behind plastic is that it's derived from fossil fuels. Natural-gas liquids such as ethane, for instance, are ""cracked"" to bring out olefins such as ethylene, which are then polymerized with other stuff to produce the many, almost infinite, varieties of plastic. If you haven't heard, there's been a ""shale revolution"" going on, and the world is awash in natural gas. The results are reverberating throughout the entire plastic production chain. Ethylene is now cheaper to make (cheaper energy costs, cheaper feedstock), and the past few years have seen a significant expansion in the production of both ethylene and polyethylene. Who gains from all this? Basically, the companies with pricing power -- the users of plastic. The less commoditized you are, the better off you'll be. A company like Lego or Hasbro will source plastic at a much better price without having to lower the retail price of its toys. For olefin producers such as LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) and Dow Chemical, it's a different story. A big part of their businesses are commoditized, and they're feeling the pressure to restructure. The Dow/DuPont merger should be seen in this light, as an attempt to carve out the higher margin segments from the rest of the business. LyondellBasell is present along the entire plastic production chain, from the refining of fossil fuels to the ""cracking"" of natural gas liquids and, of course, the actual fabrication of plastics. It's also the largest producer of ethylene in the United States; production of olefins (mainly ethylene and propylene) and polyolefins accounts for about 57% of its revenue. This is a volatile business that's exposed to a variety of prices -- not only crude oil and natural gas, but also ethane, naphtha, and, of course, ethylene and propylene. Revenue was down a whopping 28% last year. It's important to keep in mind, however, that virtually all of the dip was due to a drop in price and that volume was slightly up. The price of ethylene alone fell by 34% in the U.S. and propylene by 45%. But the cost of production also fell, so much so that earnings posted a record high. This kind of thing is not strange for a business like LyondellBasell, and that's why gross profit or EBITDA is a better measure of performance than revenue. LyondellBasell has a good balance sheet, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.9, but it's a recent Chapter 11 ""graduate"", and a watchful eye should be kept on its debt levels. At the moment, it's selling for about 7 times last year's earnings. That's cheap historically, but what makes the company really interesting is that it's a voracious buyer of its own stock. Since the end of 2013, it's reduced about a quarter of its share count. Part of the purchase has been financed with debt, but most of it has come from free cash flow. The risk with an investment like this is collapsing margins -- either a rise in feedstock prices, which can't be passed on to customers, or a fall in olefin and polyolefin prices without a corresponding fall in feedstock. The main feedstock for most U.S.-based ethylene producers is ethane, and there are some murmurings of a spike in ethane prices. It's also true that ethylene capacity will most likely expand over the coming years, all of which points to a worrying compression of margins. But all of this may be priced in, and long-term prospects may be sound, especially with the manageable debt and the extra juice from share buybacks. Going upstream to a company that's more a user of plastic than a producer of it is like taking a breath of fresh air -- the businesses are simpler, less volatile, and just better. AptarGroup (NYSE:ATR) is basically a packaging company. The fine-mist maker on your cologne bottle, pre-filled syringe components, and dispensing closures are some of its main products. Unlike LyondellBasell and its compatriots, AptarGroup is very steady in its earning power. In fact, I couldn't find the last time it's suffered a net loss. Its history is one of steady margins, moderate growth, strong free cash flow, and increasing dividends. It's a prime example of a rather boring business that happens to make good money. Aptar's margins have improved steadily over the past few years, helped by cheaper raw-material prices, and this trend may very well continue over the near future. But Aptar isn't cheap. At current prices, it's valued at about 24 times last year's earnings. Unless you think Aptar is due for some stellar growth, I would recommend you wait for a cheaper price. Of the two businesses we've mentioned -- LyondellBasell and AptarGroup -- the latter is the superior business, the former the superior investment. If I were forced to choose one over the other, my choice would have to be LyondellBasell. Quality of business is important enough to trump price on many an occasion, but in this instance, my feeling is that Aptar's superiority as a business isn't enough to wash away its price tag. And LyondellBasell, despite its near-term troubles, is still in a sound business -- one that's here to stay. After all, what can replace plastic? What else can you shape and mold in such variety, with such ease, and at such a price? ","

The payment is worth $7.07 per share for each trillion cubic feet equivalent (tcfe) of certified gross resource from the Elk-Antelope field above 6.2 tcfe and up to a maximum of 11 tcfe, up from the earlier cap of 10 tcfe.

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.  ","We're headed at a 'cyber Pearl Harbor,' says Adm James Stavridis",0.9119
489,John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump,0.8895
490,Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"With oil and gas becoming top priorities for economic growth in the incoming administration and the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC member countries to cut production, oil and gas prices will rise, Hess CEO John Hess told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly. ""It's clear that the Trump administration puts a high priority on energy, that oil and gas are engines of economic growth going forward,"" Hess said.

491,Selena Maranjian,12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland.

For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million.

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee.

Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

498,John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump,0.8895

""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs.""

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable?

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

507,John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump,0.8895
508,Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"With oil and gas becoming top priorities for economic growth in the incoming administration and the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC member countries to cut production, oil and gas prices will rise, Hess CEO John Hess told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly. ""It's clear that the Trump administration puts a high priority on energy, that oil and gas are engines of economic growth going forward,"" Hess said.

509,Selena Maranjian,12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable?

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

516,Mark Fahey,1052017,CNBC,12292016,"President-elect Donald Trump can influence stock prices and change corporate plans simply by tweeting, and few companies are as dependent on the government as the big contractors. About 61 entities earned $1 billion or more from federal contracts in the 2015 fiscal year, and 34 of those are publicly traded companies, according to data from the federal procurement data system. As you would expect, the biggest recipients are defense contractors, which already had good reason to watch Trump closely after he was involved in a deal to keep Carrier jobs in Indiana. Companies like Lockheed Martin may top the list at $36 billion in contractual obligations, but companies across several other industries are getting a huge amount of their revenue from the government, according to data from the federal system and FactSet. For the energy sector, Exxon Mobil is the biggest contractor with almost $800 million in petroleum contracts, mostly for the Defense Logistics Agency. That may seem like a lot, but it's a negligible fraction of the energy giant's revenue each year. The same is true for the telecom leader, AT&T, and shipping leader FedEx, which each made a little over $600 million from the government in 2015. The situation is completely different for the leading firm in information technology, SAIC, which depends on government contracts for 78 percent of its revenue. Private prisons firm GEO Group lead the real estate sector, making about 71 percent of its $1.8 billion in sales from government contracts. In health care, McKesson Corp. made over $8 billion, most of which came from its lucrative relationship with Veteran's Affairs. That's about 4 percent of the pharmaceutical distributor's revenue. For companies classified as financial firms, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest government contractor. But the company didn't earn that position through its financial businesses — most of its government revenue came from its nonfinancial holdings, including providing metals to the U.S. Mint, mobile homes for FEMA and flight training for the FAA, according to government data. Not counting state or local spending, the federal government paid almost $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015. Those are big sums, and those companies are going to be noticing everything Trump says. ",Top government contractors: 52 public companies that make the most,0.9771
517,Michael K. Farr,1052017,CNBC,12292016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary,0.9998

Read:  Attorney Jay Clayton to be nominated to be SEC chairman, Trump says Dave Anderson at the Energy and Policy Institute, an industry watchdog, writes on the Thursday that Clayton’s law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, takes a “rather striking” view on the issue of climate change disclosure despite having represented a slew of fossil fuel firms.

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering. The company’s IPO filing included a lengthy disclosure of its risks related to climate-change policies.

See also:  Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure It remains to be seen whether Clayton will take the SEC back to its lax enforcement days on the climate change disclosure issue or if he will carry his firm’s advice over to agency policy. At stake, writes Anderson, is the SEC’s interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure provided to companies in 2010, and the SEC’s related investigation into Exxon.

519,Abigail Stevenson,1122017,CNBC,1052017,"While the market continues to focus on whether the Dow Jones industrial average will hit 20,000, Jim Cramer would rather look at how conceivable it is for the Dow to keep running after it does. Good news is that he does think it is possible. ""When you look at how far stocks would need to rally to get back to their all-time highs, you will find that many of these Dow names have been much higher in less fortuitous circumstances,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer boiled it down to 12 encouraging stocks that must advance more than 10 percent to get back to their old highs. No. 1 is Wal-Mart, which would need to climb 32 percent to get back to where it was two years ago. With the strength of Amazon, Cramer recognized that this is a lot to ask and said he doesn't expect it to help the Dow get to 20,000. No. 2 is American Express. The stock has 28 percent to run back to its 2014, and Cramer recommended buying it at current levels. All it would take is a multiple expansion now that the multiple is in favor. No. 3 was IBM, which would have to mount a 26 percent gain to get back to its $216 high in 2013. Unfortunately, Cramer didn't think IBM will get back to a 15 price-to-earnings multiple up from its current 12. ""In truth, IBM should never have been as high as $216. Its earnings were inflated by buybacks and the price was hyped by hoopla surrounding Warren Buffett's anointment of the stock,"" Cramer said. No. 4 was Nike, the most intriguing stock to Cramer. Nike would need its stock to advance 26 percent to reach old highs, and Cramer thinks if Donald Trump can lower the corporate tax rate, it could help move it higher. However, he wasn't confident that it can close the gap between $53 and $67. No. 5 was Caterpillar, which also told investors it's not doing that well. It also would be the most hurt if Trump starts to play hardball with China, but it would also be a large beneficiary to a domestic infrastructure program. Cramer was willing to bet that the stock can creep towards its old level on positive commodity data and cost cuts from Trump. No. 6 and 7 were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which need to add 17 percent to get back to their old highs, and Cramer won't count on them to get the Dow to 20,000. ""Frankly, that is just asking too much of these stocks,"" Cramer said. No. 8 was Coca-Cola, and with a new CEO coming in, Cramer was willing to bet that the restructuring designed by outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent means the company will meet its numbers. However, he says the stock cannot be relied on to rally 14 percent to its former glory. No. 9 was Apple, and Cramer thinks the stock is looking like it will break out soon. It must advance a little more than 13 percent, and Cramer is concerned that Apple hasn't augmented its service revenue stream and isn't using its massive cash hoard to make more acquisitions. No. 10 was Cisco, which is still reeling from a downbeat quarter. Cramer wants Cisco to find a way to make it clear that its legacy business isn't hurting it as it transitions to more of a cloud play. He wasn't confident that the stock can rally 13 percent to its recent high. No. 11 and 12 was Disney and United Technologies, which need to rally 12 and 10 percent respectively to get to all-time highs. Based on Disney's theme park attendance, movies and potential to be a beneficiary of a corporate tax cut, Cramer called this one an ""up"" stock United Technologies will have a tough time gaining traction because of its recent strong run. If anything, Cramer expects the numbers to come down. So, while Cramer only found a few stocks among the list that could get back to old highs, many of them reached such high levels in a worse environment. Perhaps they can do it again.

520,Fred Imbert,1122017,CNBC,1052017,"U.S. equities closed higher in choppy trade on Wednesday, shrugging off a sharp decline in health care stocks following remarks made by President-elect Donald Trump. ""We have to get our drug industry coming back. Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right,"" Trump said at his first news conference since winning the U.S. election. The Nasdaq composite fell after Trump made his remarks, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3 percent. The tech-heavy index, however, ended the session 0.2 percent higher at a record closing level. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent, shrugging off a 1 percent decline in health care. Energy stocks led the way in the S&P, rising 1.2 percent. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said the stock market has largely given Trump  the benefit of the doubt. He said that would change after the inauguration. ""After that point, his actions will become more important versus what he says,"" he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 99 points higher, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index briefly turned lower after Trump's remarks on the pharmaceutical industry. Investors came into the news conference looking for clues about his proposed policies. Stocks in the U.S. have rallied sharply since Trump's victory, amid hope that the incoming administration will cut corporate taxes, deregulate certain sectors and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Trump's news conference concluded without him providing details on these policies. ""We need some concrete numbers. We haven't sold off because there hasn't been a reason to do so. That said, you're dealing with some pretty nervous longs here,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Our hope is that these three policies will be enacted and a more pragmatic approach will be taken to trade and immigration,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. He also said he expects Trump to wait until the after the inauguration to provide more guidance on his policies. That said, some of the president-elect's tweets have raised concerns among investors. Since Nov. 8, Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize companies that planned to send jobs overseas rather than create them in the United States. He has also threatened to levy a high border tax against those firms. ""What's interesting about Trump is he's sort of managed to work around the traditional news cycle,"" said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. ""The market is also grappling with that, too."" ""Companies like Airbus and Boeing will not only have to think about their input cost, but they will also have to pay attention to (the) PR perspective,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Separately, Trump's nominee for secretary of State Rex Tillerson, testified on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearing. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has raised concerns among most of the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Marco Rubio, given his lack of public service experience and close ties to Russia. ""There's so much that could come out from those hearings,"" said Hartford Funds' Siomades. ""This cast of characters is not well known, and the market could react to that."" Wall Street also braced itself for the start of earnings season, as banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among others, are slated to report quarterly results on Friday. ""I think we're going to get a good earnings season,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. ""The question is can the market sustain the euphoria with what could still be considered relatively modest earnings growth."" In the bond market, meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys traded higher after Trump's news conference, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.365 percent and the two-year note yield holding near 1.18 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after trading higher, with the euro near $1.057 and the yen around 115.38. The pound briefly fell around 1 percent against the dollar, breaking below $1.21. Sterling last traded at $1.22. Overseas, European equities traded higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing 0.23 percent. In Asia, Chinese stocks closed lower overnight, with the Shanghai composite  dropping 0.79 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225  recorded a gain of 0.33 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 19,954.28, with Merck leading advancers and Pfizer  lagging. The S&P 500 rose 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at 2,275.32, with energy leading eight sectors higher and health care the top decliner.

The election of Donald Trump has many wondering whether the renewable energy industry will continue to flourish in the United States. Much to FuelCell Energy's (NASDAQ:FCEL) delight, though, there are several signs suggesting that America's neighbors to the north have no intention of slowing down. Though it's uncertain how advantageous this is for FuelCell Energy, it does represent some interesting opportunities -- opportunities that could possibly translate to ever-elusive profits. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. There's certainly been no shortage of talk about pipelines extending from Canada recently. Stealing some of the headlines from the Dakota Access Pipeline, another familiar name -- Keystone XL -- has been reappearing since Donald Trump revealed his support of the pipeline to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Both leaders' apparent enthusiasm for activity in the oil sands bodes well for FuelCell Energy, which recently revealed its participation in related studies. Partnering with Alberta Innovates, FuelCell Energy will conduct an engineering study for a fuel-cell carbon capture application at a heavy oil refinery near Saskatchewan. According to FuelCell Energy's press release, ""A second potential site, the Scotford bitumen upgrading facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, will also be evaluated as part of the engineering study."" Operated by Royal Dutch Shell, the facility is part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project -- site of the first commercial application of carbon capture and storage in the oil sands industry. FuelCell Energy also revealed in its press release that should the study prove that the application is a success, it could lead to ""a megawatt-scale fuel cell carbon application at an existing gas-fired plant."" It's not just the oil sands that represent an opportunity for FuelCell Energy, but coal power as well. The Canadian government recently announced its plan to phase out traditional coal-power plants by 2030. In working toward that goal, the government will work with four provinces to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-power plants. Canada's commitment could benefit FuelCell Energy, as the company began a partnership with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) last spring on developing technology for carbon capture through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. A 2.8 MW DFC3000 fuel-cell power plant. Image source: FuelCell Energy corporate website. Addressing the benefits of this application, Chip Bottone, FuelCell Energy's president and CEO, recognized that, ""Carbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants."" Testing the fuel cell carbon capture technology with its DFC3000 fuel-cell power system at a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal- and gas-fired power plant in Alabama, the company estimates that the DFC3000 fuel-cell power system reduces approximately 70% of a plant's smog-producing pollutants like nitrogen oxides and remove 90% of carbon from the exhaust stream. Between the oil sands and transition from coal power, Canada's opportunities may very well be sources of revenue for FuelCellEnergy in the years to come. Unfortunately, those years are considerably down the line, and the company has much more pressing issues to contend with right now -- so much so that it may never get to realize those opportunities in the Great White North. Updating investors in December, management reported that it was ""reducing materials spend as well as implementing various cost control initiatives"" in order to achieve its long-term goals. The company, for example, reduced its global workforce by 17% as well as implementing other measures in order to reduce its operating expenses by $6 million on an annualized basis. This would translate to an approximate reduction of 14% based on the $42 million that the company reported in fiscal 2015. Further illustrating the company's precarious position, management noted it was forecasting revenue to fall to a range of $107 million to $109 million for fiscal 2016 -- a far cry from the range of $170 million to $210 million that it had forecast on the Q4 conference call in 2015. No longer a contender for the Beacon Falls Energy Park -- worth a potential $500 million between equipment and service over its life, according to management -- FuelCell Energy is relying on the more than $400 million it has in contracted backlog as of Oct. 31, 2016 to keep the lights on. Any opportunities in Canada that inspire hopes of profits must be tempered by the reality that the company is still struggling to prove the advantages of its fuel-cell solutions to customers.

Investors haven't been happy with IBM (NYSE:IBM) lately. Since Ginni Rometty started as CEO in January of 2012, IBM has seen 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year declining revenue -- essentially every quarter of her tenure. The stock has lost nearly 10% compared to a gain of 78% for the S&P 500 over the last five years. IBM 5 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. For IBM shareholders, Ginni Rometty's four-year reign as chief executive officer hasn't been anything to go to Disneyland about. But her company has become a leader in one corporate category: board members willing to shovel incentive pay at a CEO turning in a mediocre performance. With all the negative sentiment and equally dismal stock performance, should investors have any hope that IBM will right the ship? IBM believes it can, and it's betting the future on Watson. You may recall how Ken Jennings, famous for his 74 consecutive wins on Jeopardy, was dethroned by Watson, the IBM supercomputer. Why would a company risk so much on a game-playing computer? The key is not in the computer as much as in the science behind it. IBM's Watson beats 74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings.  Image source: Flickr user edwardhblake. Watson is a system based on artificial intelligence (AI). Computer simulations of the human brain, called neural networks, mimic humans' capacity to learn. Using massive amounts of data and complex algorithms, an AI system gradually learns to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. It is taught to recognize patterns within massive amounts of data. IBM has been betting heavily on Watson by leveraging its AI platform and data analytics for a variety of business applications. The company's CEO has said that, in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of Watson. Several recent high-profile partnerships illustrate how IBM has been approaching this goal, and the strategy appears to be gaining steam. UA Record smartphone app powers Healthbox.     Image source: Under Armour. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) announced a strategic partnership with IBM to leverage the 190 million registered users of its Connected Fitness platform and Watson's deep-learning technology. The system would provide users with individual health and fitness insights backed by data. It is intended to act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer, and assistant. This collaboration underpins the HealthBox, Under Armour's connected fitness system, which combines a fitness band, digital scale, heart-rate monitor, and the UA Record smartphone app. It will track sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, and training information, and provide personalized recommendations. This is a valuable project for IBM since Watson learns with each infusion of data. The partnership is a win for Under Armour as well, and is part of a bigger play. Its acquisition of three fitness app companies that now comprise its Connected Fitness platform, the release of Healthbox, and the integration of Watson provides Under Armour with an end-to-end health and fitness solution that connects to its users in a very real way. This will likely drive future adoption and boost customer satisfaction. OnStar Go powered by Watson. Image source: General Motors Company. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) partnered with IBM to pair its OnStar vehicle-communication system with Watson's learning capabilities to create OnStar Go, a cognitive mobility platform. According to the press release, the new platform's numerous benefits include helping drivers avoid traffic, giving them the ability to order coffee on the go, making restaurant recommendations, and reminding users to pick up diapers and formula on the way home. Drivers will have to consent, and Watson will recognize their preferences and patterns in their decisions and habits. This will also develop individualized and location-based marketing. The partnership will present other business opportunities. OnStar has already signed iHeartRadio, which will provide personalized musical experiences, and MasterCard, which will allow consumers to pay for gas and other services from their car. Other partners include ExxonMobil, Glympse, and Parkopedia. iOS enterprise developers get access to Watson. Image source: IBM. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM's partnership was first announced over two years ago but has evolved in the meantime. Initially, the pair planned the development of over 100 enterprise apps for a variety of industries, including retail, healthcare, banking, transportation, and insurance. According to a recent announcement, enterprise iOS users will have in-app access to Watson, opening the door to deep-learning technology for these made-for-business apps. iOS app developers will be able to use Watson's AI as a platform for their own apps. Apple has already benefited from the partnership by gaining inroads into enterprise. IBM announced last year that it had begun to replace its PCs with Apple Mac computers. Employees were given the option to make the switch and 73% chose Mac. In a presentation at Jamf Nation User Conference, a gathering of Mac system administrators, IBM told attendees that PCs were three times more expensive to manage, Macs had a lower total cost of ownership, and that the Mac was the standard at IBM Japan -- PCs were the exception. These recent developments will provide greater validation to Apple's prospective enterprise customers while advancing the company's AI agenda. Apple has an installed base of over 1 billion active iOS devices with a growing percentage of those in enterprise. This, combined with Watson's ability to learn from streams of data, will provide both companies with a stronger relative position from which to compete. These collaborations are merely the most high-profile examples of hundreds going on behind the scenes. IBM tweeted earlier this year that more than 500 partners and 80,000 developers were building products and apps powered by Watson. The installed base that comes with the partnerships is growing, and should eventually show up in IBM's revenue and provide vindication for the company's Watson-centric strategy. IBM expects Watson to contribute $1 billion in revenue by 2018, and $10 billion by 2023, though it doesn't currently break out that contribution. Strategic Initiatives, where Watson's revenue resides was $8 billion in the most recent quarter, of $19 billion total revenue for IBM. It's a relatively small slice for IBM now, but it's clear the company expects to build AI into a major pillar of its business in the next few years. If it works, it might just reverse fortunes for the flailing big tech company.  ","

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering.

524,Jack Hough,1122017,MarketWatch,1052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

                                   launched in 2011. “But investors are stepping on the gas with valuations high. If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016). Since then, the iShares Russell 1000 Value exchange-traded fund

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

The fund lagged behind the S&P 500 in both 2014 and 2015 but trounced it last year, and is now ahead by two percentage points a year on average over the past five years. The GoodHaven fund is managed by a pair of alumni from the Fairholme fund, which is known for concentrated positions and spectacular periods of over- and underperformance, mostly the former. This has added up to long-term returns well ahead of the market, but also plenty of discomfort along the way. Launched in 2011, GoodHaven, too, is keeping things interesting.

525,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"The deal, Exxon’s biggest since its 2009 buyout of XTO Energy, is the latest by oil producers across the Permian since last summer, with technological improvements and rangebound oil prices fueling the buyouts. Exxon is exchanging an initial $5.6 billion in stock for leases covering roughly 275,000 acres from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Additional payments of up to $1 billion will start in 2020, depending on how the acreage performs, Exxon said in a statement. Most of the wells to be drilled on the land should provide “attractive returns” with oil prices CLc1 at or above $40 per barrel, Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said. Much of the Permian’s oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more. About 250,000 acres is on three large parcels in the Permian, and the rest is on oil fields in Colorado and Louisiana. The Permian land, which Exxon estimates holds 3.4 billion barrels of oil retrievable with current technology, produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), most of which is crude. Most of the acreage is held by production, meaning Exxon will not have to rush to add new wells to honor lease contracts. Exxon pumps about 140,000 boepd from its current Permian holdings of roughly 1.5 million acres. The company operates 10 drilling rigs in the Permian and said it will boost that to 25 to develop the new acreage, though no timetable has been set. The deal is the first major move by Chief Executive Darren Woods since he took over from Rex Tillerson, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be U.S. secretary of state. Exxon plans to run the acreage through its XTO subsidiary, which operates elsewhere in Texas and North Dakota. Exxon’s shares were up about 0.6 percent in midday trading. ","

526,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

527,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to overhaul a gasoline producing unit and the hydrocracker at its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery in March, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday. The 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 2 and the 25,000 bpd Hydrocracking Unit 1 will be shut along with other units during the overhaul, the sources said. FCCU 2 is the smaller of two cat crackers at the refinery. The 125,000 bpd FCCU 1 will remain in operation during the work. HCU 1 is the only hydrocracker at the refinery. A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high pressure to produce motor fuels, primarily diesel from gas oil. The Baytown refinery is the second largest in the United States and Exxon’s largest U.S. refinery. ","

528,Tom DiChristopher,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"The world's biggest publicly traded energy company is joining the land rush in the prolific Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil announced Tuesday it will pay $5.6 billion in stock to acquire companies owned by Texas' Bass family that control parts of the Permian in New Mexico. The purchase roughly doubles Exxon's holdings in the basin, adding acreage with an estimated 3.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The assets are located in the Delaware Basin, part of the larger Permian. The deal is the largest oil and gas acquisition in the United States since crude prices crashed in November 2014, according to Houston-based oil and gas research firm PLS. It tops the previous record-setting $4.4 billion purchase of Memorial Resources by Range Resources in May. ""This acquisition strengthens Exxon Mobil's significant presence in the dominant U.S. growth area for onshore oil production,"" Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren W. Woods said in a statement. ""This investment gives us an exceptional Delaware Basin position ... that can generate attractive returns in a low-price environment."" Shares of Exxon were up modestly Tuesday. The Delaware Basin has lately boasted eye-popping land prices. Deals there made up the bulk of last year's $69 billion in U.S. energy mergers and acquisitions. Permian acreage is a prized because the basin's geology allows drillers to produce oil at very low prices and profit from the operations even as a severe crude price downturn extends into a third year. The adjusted per-acre price for Exxon's purchase comes in at about $20,000, ""a very good number for New Mexico,"" said Andrew Dittmar, mergers and acquisitions analyst at PLS. Exxon will pay the Basses, a prominent Forth Worth energy family, up to $1 billion in cash contingent on the land's production. The deal marks the second recent purchase of Delaware Basin assets controlled by a storied energy family. In September, EOG Resources bought Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion. The Yates family's history in American oil stretches back about a century. EOG paid about $9,000 per acre in that deal, which was also centered on New Mexico's Lea and Eddy counties, PLS data shows. Exxon's deal also comes just one day after Noble Energy paid $3.2 billion, including debt, to buy Clayton Williams Energy. That acquisition focused on assets in the southern Delaware Basin in Texas, at a price of $33,000 per acre, according to PLS.

""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals.

530, ,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"Following are excerpts from a CNBC interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, from the World Economic Forum 2017 with Steve Sedgwick SS: Patrick great to see you again. Look the world is seemingly a different place 12 months on, the oil price has pretty much doubled. Does that make your job a lot easier? PP: For sure it is easier at 55 dollar then 28 dollar.  . I don't know if the word is easier. I begin to believe that the oil price is maybe a leading indicator of the mood of the world. But you know when you compare the situation one year ago, price collapse to 28 dollar a barrel, and the atmosphere in Davos was not very optimistic. This year is 55 but I remind you two years ago it was 100. So still some gap to do. People are more positive. And at the same time the status of the world did not improve a lot you know, in the one year many events in the Middle East, Brexit, many difficulties appear around the world so, but people are more positive. SS: Well that's interesting because we've seen the markets recover, we've seen the oil price recover and yet we've seen a whole host of quite damning political events for many in 2016 as well. But you think despite those political events the world is actually a more positive place and perhaps a safer place? PP: Safer, no. Not safer. There are many uncertainties. I would say what characterize the world for me today is a lot of uncertainty which is not good for business. There is an economist who was saying at the beginning of the century you have a difference between risks and uncertainty, risk you can manage, you can quantify risks. Uncertainty you don't know. And today what I face is many uncertainty- we are waiting to see what the foreign policy of Donald Trump will be, clearly Brexit and there is huge uncertainty over the future of Europe and how you deal with such a country outside of the European union, plus of course in the Middle East Iran is back because of the agreement last year- it involved many difficulties around. So there is much uncertainty. SS: All right, well you've mentioned three very important areas as well- Mr. Trump, Iran and Europe's cohesion. Let's start off with Mr. Trump as well. How's it going to be for you, do you think actually he's going to change the way that oil companies are going to do business in the US and elsewhere, do you think there's going to be any meteoric changes at all? PP:I think clearly, on energy, there are plenty of specialist of energy in this government, he has strong feeling that energy is one of the advantage of the U.S. economy already today in fact. So he's willing to not put too much regulations in order to help the investment in energy so it's good for energy companies, at least for oil and gas companies, so it's positive I think from these companies' point of view. We'll see then what he will do exactly- because you know there is a difference between what you say and when you are in power. We will see. SS: You say oil and gas companies, the oil companies are becoming more and more gas and oil companies and so the push to cleaner hydrocarbons, to renewables as well, the big investments that you at Total have been in making in green energy, in solar, in storage as well. Do you think a lot of that is actually going to be more difficult to carry on with large levels of investment because of Mr. Trump? PP: Not for gas, you know gas is one the big advantage of the U.S. economy, the shale gas revolution is at the heart of this rejuvenation of the US manufacturing industry, it is energy which is at the core of the capacity of the US to grow their manufacturing industry, to develop jobs. By the way we have invested in gas in the US this year, we have extended our position in Texas, in the Barnett. We just announced a deal with a (company name not clear) a gas company that wants to export energy. So for me US gas is working well. Renewables, we are also shown some progress- I suspect maybe the fiscal incentives which have been planned for renewables maybe will diminish but we will see. SS: That's quite damning in what is arguably the world's largest consumer of energy. PP: Yeah but OK in the meantime renewables have made progress so again it's a matter- I think there will be some debate between the congress, the President so we will see what the outcome will be of all that. But I'm positive, I think the U.S. economy is already strong. So I don't know if Mr. Trump will be able to do it stronger but it seems that it is his vision but we will see what he is doing exactly. SS: It's  no secret that Exxon Mobil and Total, and Total backed by a lot of other companies have a difference of opinion of a way to approach climate change and approach sustainability and what the remedy might be for oil and gas companies. How do you think Rex Tillerson might be as Secretary of State and what does it mean do you think for relations with other players including Russia? PP: There are many questions there. Climate change, Russia you know. I think first, I think the testimony from Rex Tillerson was quite clear- he believes in climate change, then there is the question of what is the strategy of Exxon now that he is no longer in charge. The difference was more between Exxon and Total: Should we involve the company in this green energy business to prepare for the future, that is a strategy decision, we believe that it is a matter of market, not just climate change, if we want to find new growth we can continue in oil and gas but at a certain point demand could peak so we prefer to prepare for the future and invest some of our money in renewable energy storage. Having said that, in twenty years we still remain an oil and gas company. But having also a foot in renewables. SS: And the second point, Mr. Tillerson knows Russia very well, you know Russia very well. There seems to be from Mr. Trump language of a rapprochement with Mr. Putin as well. Do you think it can benefit Total and the whole oil and gas industry? PP: It's not only the oil and gas industry, it's more a matter of world stability. Clearly Russia is a big player, by the way each time you have a new U.S. President- George W. Bush, Barack Obama, now Mr. Trump, first year they all began to engage in a positive dialogue with Russia. We will see if it happens. I hope so, because frankly we cannot have a [inaudible] it's important for Europe too to find a way to stabilize all of that. It's not so easy because the U.S. also like to have a big problem [inaudible]  in front of them. But of course I am an investor in Russia so if it is more stable it is better for me but I think also it is better for the world. SS: if the US is looking for closer relations with Russia. There is concern that it actually doesn't want to continue closer relations with Iran as well. You've made investments looking at developing South Pars as well. Do you fear for those investments? I spoke to one of your peers a while back who said he was concerned about investing in Iran precisely because of what sanctions could come from the U.S. PP: Let's be clear about Iran. There is a sanctions system existing in the U.S. we have to obey to that. There is no way for Total, or any other company, to escape from that. Having said that, and I've been very transparent with the Obama administration about all the moves- we made them aware of what we were doing, we respect what we have singed, we respect the agreements, if the sanctions framework is changing we will have to adapt ourselves. So I will just observe what will be done by the Trump administration about Iran. But you know it is a world where you cannot have many enemies- China, Russia, Iran you have to select things. So we will work and again it is an opportunity for us- you know for Total if you are an oil and gas company you have to go to where there is oil and gas- there is oil and gas in Russia, there is oil and gas in Iran. Having said that I'm perfectly aware there are some risks, it is a matter then of what is the size of the risk compared to the size of the company, and investing 1 or 2 billion in Iran when we have 150bn USD of assets is not a big risk and it could be a big reward for our shareholders. SS: Where is the biggest risk for Total in 2017? PP: The biggest risk? Again, for me it is more the uncertainty internationally, it's very difficult today to tell you what will happen and I suspect it will take some months.   Because I suspect that it's not only if President Trump came to office next Friday, you still have the full administration to put in place before we understand the full policies so it will take time. We are entering into 6 months, 9 months of uncertainty and it's not good for business because what business wants is predictability you know, if you are to invest, if you want to take decisions in energy you invest for 20 years, you need to have clear frameworks so that is the main risk for us. SS: Are you getting a clear framework from Europe as well? We mentioned Brexit, we mentioned the concerns about cohesion within the EU as well. France has got a very big election which is already dividing the population as well, you have of course have had some political experience as well. What do you think about Europe in 2017? Are you worried that we're going to see more of the same that we saw of Renzi and Brexit? PP: I hope no. But I think that clearly for the European leaders it will be a very important year. we'll have new leadership coming; elections in France, in Germany, in the Netherlands and I think clearly, by the way, the position of Mr. Trump is provocative vis a vis Europe but maybe we need to be provocative and I hope for the leaders in Europe, we wake up and we build again the project. Clearly we have a problem today. We have a problem of leadership by the way. It's a question of leadership. We need leaders. I hope the new leaders in Europe will be able to offer a vision to European citizens in order to move the project forward. SS: Don't we have a leader in Europe, don't we have Frau Merkel? PP: Well yes [inaudible] Merkel but maybe we will have the next French President as well SS: ...isnt that your former boss Mr. Fillon. Total: Yeah. And I think he can be a leader for Europe. But again, it's not a choice for me, let me be very clear. I am chairman and CEO of Total, I make no politics in that. As I have said in France, I vote for Total, which is more important for me. SS: Tell us a bit more about Total in 2017 as well. Do you feel slightly less pressure though because of this oil price move, because actually you're renewables division I think from the latest numbers actually some of the profits coming from that as well. It's looking better as well. Do you feel less pressure in 2017 than perhaps at any stage in the last couple of years? Total: For sure, but we have less pressure because we've made huge efforts. All the teams of Total worked hard. We have lowered our break even under 50 dollars per barrel and in terms of cash break even with a profit of sales we're now under 40 dollars a barrel so yes we made big efforts and so over the last two years where we had a lot of CapEx because we had lots of projects or projects to be delivered, we have no higher production and or financials banking [inaudible] strong. So for me 2017 is a new era. We were under pressure. Now we can be more offensive. We have, I would say, a very good status in the company. And our objective is to benefit from still a low price because there is low cost so we want to sanction projects and we want to make new deals to have access to resources like the one we have done in Brazil in December and in Uganda with Turo [inaudible]. So Total has gone through these difficult two years in good shape. And I'm very happy now we can be more offensive. SS: Are you calling time on CapEx cuts? PP: No, no, we have what we announce is that we will spend between 15 and 17 billion dollars of CapEx from 2017. I explained to investors it is a sustainable level of CapEx, with that we will be able to continue to grow the company larger more than the market services, or target that [inaudible]. This is what we want to do. So it's not a CapExs it is landing the CapEx to the sustainable level, which is more important. SS: And in terms of the renewable side of things: You and I were in a debate in Davos talking about the transition, the energy transition, the clean energy transition as well. And there was lot of concern from Christiana Figueres about the speed of transition. Are you happy with Total's investment in renewables. Is it just right?  You mentioned 15 to 17 billion dollars.I think your investments, I mean various figures, 500 million dollars a year is the figure that it's often cited? PP: Yeah. Let's be realistic, energy is a very important matter. I mean we are in the core of the energy, we have invested in renewables we are investing and I believe when we develop a strategy because again we want to remain a major company in the energy field. Renewables we love something.  But today, if I only had renewables Total would be unable to distribute any dividends. It's still an infant industry but we need to work on it. So accelerating is tough because as we were discussing in Davos, people want not only clean energy, people want reliable energy, people want cheap energy, so we have to be pragmatic. SS: Is that the priority with people reliable and cheap, reliable and cheap ahead of clean? PP I think I suspect yes because its energy is at the core of the development, economic development and when you go to India, when you go to China you think people, of course they want clean, to be able to have clean air but they want also to have access to energy which is more important for many people in the world. So I don't think, so I think yes an energy mix will evolve. You will have less coal, less oil, more gas. More renewables but it takes time. This transition is not because you decide. It's not, there is no magic tool there. It's just a matter of investments and words [inaudible]  that people need are serious and pragmatic strategies to prepare the future. So I hear [inaudible]  acceleration I suspect we have to be pragmatic and realistic but again it's a serious matter. SS: There's another great point raised and it's by Oleg  Deripaska of Rusal that he thought that some countries and I'll paraphrase in some countries are pretty hypocritical really they're using renewables as cover for increasing coal production and coal usage as well. Do you think there's a great degree of hypocrisy out there from some companies and perhaps some countries especially. PP: No I don't think, I mean medically I don't think there is some hypocrisy but what Mr. Deripaska pointed is right. What I observe in many countries, because they have a lot of coal, coal is burnt out in China, is burnt out in India, in the US as well, is that and it's cheap to produce coal, much cheaper than gas because gas is complex, you need to liquify it and you need to transport it so what I observe is that you have many countries which try to be genuinely like India, on the road map of two degrees. We have this national production of coal and they invest in solar and wind. One hundred seventy five gigawatts by 2022. And I think the Prime Minister Modi is very dedicated to that. But yes we see a mix of coal and renewables. It's a strange mix but I observe this trend in Germany, I observe this trend in Japan. Japan wants to decrease gas and increase coal with renewables. So there's something there and I think it is one of the for me the main concern about the climate change debate because frankly if we are unable to lower the coal share in the mix, there is no chance we can reach the two degree road map [inaudible] and that requires you to pricing. SS: We need the carbon pricing. Finally, there's a lot of inequality concerns. There's a lot of concerns about the haves and have nots and if Davos is anything it's a lot of haves, it's a very rich concentration of very wealthy and influential people. Do you think the Davos bubble the Davos echo chamber actually gets the message that there's some real problems out there and they need resolving very quick. PP: Yeah you're right. Clearly we are in a bubble and we are in part of the bubble. And Total, when you speak about globalization is one of the winners of this globalisation. We have been able to develop a company. I think what is important to know is that yes we discussed about what is happening around us. I'm not sure we fully understand but there is really a willingness and we have been proposed by Davos to sign a compact about responsible leadership. Responsible leadership for me it's very important. I think big companies like us it's not only a matter to distribute salaries to employees, dividends, social orders, taxes to states. It's not enough. By listening to all of these moves but we need to bring something else to the territories from which we work. You know we have the global company for us for example in France first. Then we moved out. We are moving because we are a global company because the cost of labour is lower in other countries. But if we stay, if we leave the territories behind us without taking care, I think we are making a mistake. Normally the states should take care of that but the states are unable and so it's back to what is the responsibility of a global corporation like Total and I think there is a fourth dimension, salaries, dividends, taxes plus something which is to take care also of our own territories. And I think we need to move on that and not only to think it's a matter for all of us. It's not a problem of all of us. It's our problems because I strongly believe globalisation is a good thing for the world. We have major poverty in the world. We have plenty of emerging countries. But all population in all developed countries seem to disagree so why they disagree because they are afraid so we need to answer them. And it's not only a politician story, it's also a matter for the leaders of large corporations like Total. I don't have the magic tool there again but I am convinced that we need to do that and to tell the people we were discussing these type of matters amongst the leaders of the world in Davos so it's not only we are yes, it's a bubble but this bubble is asking itself some questions. And it's important. ","Interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total from the World Economic Forum 2017",0.9998

Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

532,Dan Caplinger,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","

533,,1262017,Reuters,1192017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

534,Gary X. Ashton,1262017,Investopedia,1192017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Chevron (CVX) is scheduled to release its fourth quarter and full year earnings results this Friday. Investors will not only be looking at how the company performed in 2016, but will also be eager to get a sense of the company’s investment plans for 2017. Oil companies have aggressively scaled back capital expenditures since the oil price downturn in 2014. The chart below shows capital expenditure for ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP), which collectively fell by 47.3% from 2013 to 3Q-2016. This has left some industry experts wondering if spending reductions have gone too far. For example, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih has warned that there could by a global oil shortage as soon as 2020 if investment flows continue to be scaled back. In an investor presentation in November 2016 posted on Chevron’s website, the company says it plans to reduce capital and exploratory spending again in 2017 by about 25% from planned 2016 spending. Friday’s results should provide an update into whether these spending cuts are being accelerated or scaled back in a rising oil price environment. Some companies are already boosting investment spending. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China's largest offshore oil explorer, CNOOC (CEO), is planning to increase investment spending in 2017 between 19% and 39% for the first time since 2014. The marginal spending increase is equivalent to approximately $8.7 to $10.2 billion, or equal to roughly half of Chevron’s entire 2017 budgeted capital spending. 2017 will likely be a pivotal year for the oil industry. Those companies increasing investment spending could benefit if oil prices continue their upward path. A renewed downturn in prices, however, could see those who increased spending nursing large losses. On the other hand, companies that are scaling back investments could see their long term competitiveness eroded, especially if the oil shortage predicted by Saudi energy minister comes to pass. Chevron reports financial results on Friday January 27th, followed by Exxon on January 31st and Conoco on February 2nd.

536,Patti Domm,1262017,CNBC,1192017,"President Donald Trump could lift sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine by himself — and may justify doing so by saying that he is putting America first. Trump is expected to discuss the sanctions when he speaks by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview Friday. The White House also announced that Trump has separate calls with the leaders of Germany and France, two U.S. NATO allies that support sanctions on Russia. ""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said regarding Russia sanctions at a press conference on Friday. ""As far as the sanctions, it's very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally."" The U.S. sanctions, imposed through executive order by President Barack Obama, can be lifted by Trump's pen — without the vote of Congress — if he so wishes, experts said. It's not clear whether his intention is to lift sanctions right away, but Trump's first official discussion with Putin could lay the groundwork for removal. ""People said Trump will never remove the sanctions on Russia. Of course he will. It's a leveling of the playing field for U.S. corporations,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities research at RBC. The sanctions against Russia hurt that country's energy industry and make it harder for Russia to raise capital. Getting rid of the sanctions is a major priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. companies, including Exxon Mobil, were forced to drop activities in Russia if they were in new areas of development, such as Arctic drilling and Russian shale. But Croft explained that European companies, under separate European Union sanctions, were allowed to continue work on existing projects while being barred only from new ones. Based on Trump's rapid-fire execution of orders in his first week, such as directing the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, experts say it's possible he could move toward lifting sanctions against Russia. He could do so without the consent of European allies, which have sanctioned Russia separately. ""Clearly, he really wants this relationship to work. I have some sympathy in the sense the U.S. relationship with Russia has been very badly damaged, and a lot of that has Obama to blame,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of global political consultancy Eurasia Group. Trump has been moving toward lifting the sanctions already. ""He has so many of his speaking points aligned with those of the Kremlin, around Crimea, Ukraine, around Syria, around American exceptionalism and values,"" Bremmer said. Trump also seems bent to to move forward without gaining agreement from historic allies in Europe. ""If I were advising Trump, I would want him to be coordinating with Merkel and others who were steadfast allies ... I think he's made up his mind on this,"" said Bremmer. ""I guess what we've been learning about Trump is that he actually does what he said he was going to do. The problem is the sanctions were imposed for what the Russians did in Ukraine and Crimea. The Germans have worked hard to keep this together, as the French president has,"" said Professor Angela Stent, director Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. ""This would send a message to Russia that it can get away with it, but it undermines the European Union's efforts to hold Russia accountable."" Obama first imposed sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea, claiming it to be part of Russia. ""It's the Europeans who did it much later when the (Malaysian) airline was shot down over Ukraine,"" Stent said. Bremmer expects Trump to move forward regardless of prevailing sentiment Europe, where nationalist candidates stand to gain ground in several elections this year. In France, Marine Le Pen has gained in polls. She says she wants to get rid of the euro currency. ""Germany is the country that's in the most vulnerable position because of Trump, compared to most of the American allies. Europe is getting weaker. He likes Brexit, says other countries should leave. Germany is the country most interested in maintaining a strong Europe, and Trump is undermining (Merkel). Trump is renouncing American exceptionalism, in not telling other countries what to do,"" said Bremmer. At the same press conference where Trump spoke on Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May was forthright in saying that sanctions against Russia should continue until Russia conforms agreements designed to reduce fighting in Ukraine. Bremmer believes Trump will move forward quickly. But other experts say Trump may ease sanctions slowly — and therefore less visibly — rather than tossing them out right after taking office. Critics have called out Trump for praising Vladimir Putin, whom U.S. intelligence concluded was personally involved in trying to undermine last year's U.S. presidential election and help get Trump elected. Rex Tillerson, Trump's candidate for Secretary of State who just retired as CEO of ExxonMobil, and has strong personal links to Moscow and his former company has billions at stake in Russia. Trump initially refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russian officials intentionally meddled in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic National Committee computers. Trump has since vowed to make the U.S. more secure from cyber espionage, but has said nothing about punishing Russia. There is also another consideration. Tillerson has yet to be approved by the Senate. Tillerson was questioned by Congress on his feelings about Russia. One strategist said Trump may not lift sanctions right away because of the Tillerson vote, expected next week. Exxon has one of the most high-profile projects that was disrupted by sanctions, an Arctic drilling deal with Rosneft. The joint venture with Russian state-controlled oil giant was to explore and produce fossil fuels in Arctic waters, and it represents a big part of Exxon's potential future production growth. The sanctions were imposed in 2014, and Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its ""maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures"" totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Russian projects were able to find some other funding sources, including China. Rosneft recently raised funds by selling an $11 billion stake to Qatar and Glencore. If the sanctions are lifted, Croft said the knee jerk reaction in the oil market would likely be a decline in prices just because of the prospect of more supply. Under the sanctions, Russia actually was able to increase its oil production, and the decline in the ruble actually helped producers by keeping production costs lower. Croft said the move in oil prices would be temporary, since the new supply from Russia would not be immediate, and Russia is part of a producers group, with OPEC, that has agreed to cut back production to keep oil prices at a higher level. If the sanctions are lifted, one area of immediate interest would be in the potential for Russian shale. The Bazhenov Shale formation in the West Siberian basin is believed to hold massive reserves of tight oil — which can be reached by U.S.-pioneered technology that Russia can't access because of the sanctions — and that could be one of the first places companies might want to invest. ""Russian oil production has been strong, and it's actually increased until the OPEC deal. It could mean a renewal of Western investment in Russian oil, in the new areas in terms of tight oil, Arctic and offshore,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of research firm IHS Markit. ""The taste for big expensive long term projects is a lot lower today than it was when the sanctions were imposed. One area that is very interesting is tight oil in Russia."" Tight oil has been much cheaper to extract through horizontal drilling than deep water projects. ""There's a debate about how prolific it is,"" said Yergin, who said the Bazhenov by all signs is a huge reserve and would take a while to develop. ""If the analysis of U.S. shale is used, it could be very significant. I think all these development take time, and it takes a lot of experience to determine all of these resources and how to recover it. Certainly it would be a whole new horizon for Russian oil,"" he said. ",President Trump could say 'America first' to end sanctions on Russia,0.9917

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent.

With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","
      
    The Best Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors -- The Motley Fool

Image source: Getty Images. It would be an understatement to say that 2016 was a tough year for the oil patch. Plunging crude prices heading into the year forced producers to reduce investment spending so deeply that many couldn't even drill enough wells needed to keep production flat. Because of these market conditions, oil companies spent minuscule amounts of capital exploring for new oil and gas sources. As a result, the industry found the fewest new barrels of oil in 70 years. According to a report by energy research firm Rystad Energy, oil companies discovered a mere 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) last year outside of North American shale plays. For perspective, the U.S. alone consumes more than 7 billion barrels annually, which meant the industry did not come close to replacing consumption last year. Meanwhile, offshore discoveries, which is where companies uncovered most of the new sources of oil in recent years, fell 90% from 2010's level to just 2.3 billion BOE last year. This trend is not one that can continue given that world oil demand is not expected to peak until 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Image source: ConocoPhillips. The primary driver of last year's decline was the continued drop in exploration spending. Energy companies only spent $40 billion on exploratory drilling last year, which resulted in 40% fewer wells drilled than in 2014 when prices started on their downward spiral. Global oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for example, cut its global capital and exploratory budget by 24% from 2015's level to $26.6 billion. However, Chevron only earmarked $1 billion of that budget for exploration, well below the $3 billion budget the company set for 2015. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) cut its global exploration and appraisal budget down to $1.4 billion last year, a decline of 22% from 2015. Another culprit behind last year's low level of oil discoveries is that several exploration prospects came up dry. For example, a joint venture between ConocoPhillips, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) struck out in its initial attempt at finding oil in the Shelburne Basin off Canada's Atlantic Coast. As a result, Suncor Energy noted that it had to write off its share of the costs, which totaled 105 million Canadian dollars. That dry hole was one of a growing number of deepwater exploration failures for ConocoPhillips in recent years. In 2015, the company noted that a deepwater exploration well in Angola found a non-commercial gas column and another in the Gulf of Mexico did not encounter any hydrocarbons. As a result, it plugged and abandoned both wells, writing off $142 million in dry hole expenses. These and other dry holes drove its decision to exit deepwater exploration altogether. Image source: Suncor Energy Inc. While oil discoveries were down significantly, oil companies still found several notable new oil and gas deposits. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), for example, announced in June that an offshore well in Guyana confirmed a world-class oil discovery. According to ExxonMobil, this deposit contains between 800 million to 1.4 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Then, in October, the oil giant confirmed a discovery offshore Nigeria that holds between 500 million to 1 billion barrels of oil. Finally, the company capped the year off with a December announcement of a new onshore natural gas discovery in Papua New Guinea. Energy companies made several other smaller discoveries around the world last year. Norwegian oil giant Statoil (NYSE:EQNR), for example, finished up its Canadian Atlantic exploration program last year, which resulted in two more discoveries and the confirmation that its 2013 Bay du Nord find contains between 300 million to 600 million barrels of recoverable oil. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell made a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at its Fort Sumter prospect, uncovering more than 125 million BOE. That was one of three new Gulf finds last year, though that is down from seven in 2015. Image source: Apache Corporation. While offshore discoveries proved tougher to locate, North American onshore shale plays continued to be the gifts that keep on giving. One of the most notable shale discoveries was Apache's (NYSE:APA) Alpine High play in a sleepy part of Texas' Permian Basin. Apache believes that there's at least 3 billion barrels of oil and another 75 trillion cubic feet of gas in just two of the five rock formations underneath its acreage position in the region. Apache believes that the other formations could also contain significant quantities of recoverable hydrocarbons. On top of that, several other producers increased their estimates for ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries from their acreage position in various shale plays. One of the most notable was EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), which more than doubled its Permian Basin net resource potential from 2.35 billion BOE to 6 billion BOE. That upward revision came just a year after EOG Resources boosted its resource estimate in the region by 1 billion BOE due to improved recoveries resulting from advances in technology. The decline in offshore oil and gas discoveries will not have an immediate impact on global oil supplies. That is because it can often take a decade or more to turn offshore finds into production due to the high costs and long construction lead times. Furthermore, there's plenty of prior deepwater discoveries to develop as well as a plethora of shale resources to unleash. That said, the lack of new discoveries in recent years could prove problematic a decade from now as producers deplete currently producing fields. Given the forecast that oil demand will not peak for several decades, it suggests that the world will need to continue uncovering and developing new oil deposits. That means the industry cannot continue the recent history of failing even to come close to replacing production because there will come a point where this shortfall will impact supply. Such an event could cause a significant run-up in oil prices while producers race to meet the market's needs. ","
      
    Oil Companies Just Had Their Worst Year Since 1940 -- The Motley Fool

540,Michael Brush,1262017,MarketWatch,1192017,"Published: Jan 24, 2017 9:50 a.m. ET These are the companies that may benefit the most, according to a survey of analysts and fund managers By Donald Trump’s critics like to claim he doesn’t stand for anything. But that’s just because they haven’t looked hard enough. In speeches, online campaign policy messages and even tweets, Trump has regularly detailed policy reforms especially for business and the economy. These include lower taxes, fiscal stimulus, incentives to bring earnings home and protectionist policies. Though he didn’t add any details in his inauguration speech — and that’s never the point of this ceremonial address — his “America first” theme underscored his intent to enact those policies. After all, those policies basically put U.S. companies and the U.S. economy first. Will he actually get all of this done? No one knows. But with so many friends in Congress, and a majority there, it would be a mistake to count him out. As we’ve seen, prognosticators who discount Trump have a way of ending up looking dumb. So as the new president starts his first week in the White House, this is a good time to take stock of companies that will benefit the most from key Trump business and economic policies, according to Wall Street analysts. Here’s a comprehensive roundup. Companies with sales in the good ol’ US of A Trump has made it clear he wants some form of protectionism as a cornerstone of his economic policy. For better or worse, and whatever form this takes, it’s likely to benefit companies that generate most of their sales at home. Those companies will also get a direct shot of assistance from fiscal stimulus. They’ll get a relative boost from any ongoing strength in the dollar, since this reduces reported earnings for companies that get much of their earnings overseas. Goldman Sachs singles out the following companies as potential Trump policy beneficiaries because they generate virtually all of their revenue in the U.S. Naturally, many of them are in retail, and consumer products and services. Candidates for a Trump bump here include: Lowe’s

That’s because the new president is likely to take steps to block subsidized steel from China sold here below cost. “We are going to have greater scrutiny on steel tariffs and how much steel is imported,” says Marshall. U.S. steel companies will also benefit from a rebound in infrastructure spending and manufacturing. “A lot of them are at 60% capacity,” says Marshall. “We think it could get closer to 80% or 90%.” One of his favorites is Commercial Metals

                                   in this space. Companies with low labor costs The labor markets are so tight at 4.7% unemployment, companies have to bid up wages to get or keep workers. This is why average hourly wages recently saw the biggest jump since 2009, at 2.9%. Now, Trump wants to apply fiscal stimulus in the form of personal and corporate tax cuts, and more spending on the military, veterans benefits and infrastructure. That’s an unorthodox policy at full employment, because it risks sparking so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to get overly aggressive in raising rates — which could spook markets. All of this remains to be seen as a risk. In the meantime, with labor costs clearly on the march and greater wage pressure ahead, thanks to Trump stimulus, it makes sense to favor companies that don’t spend a lot on labor, relative to revenue. A group of low-labor-cost companies suggested by Goldman Sachs late last year has vastly outperformed companies with high labor costs. Analysts at the investment bank expect this to continue in 2017, as wages continue to go up and the market prices in higher inflation. As an added plus, the low-labor-cost companies singled out by Goldman Sachs, below, have faster sales and earnings growth compared with high-labor-cost companies. Consumer-facing low-labor-cost companies favored as winners by Goldman Sachs include: Netflix

                                    QCOM, -0.61% Companies that pay high taxes After Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act lowered taxes in October 1986, large-cap companies paying the highest tax rates beat the broad market for the next three years, points out Credit Suisse analyst Lori Calvasina. So now with Trump looking to lower the corporate tax rate, it makes sense to go with companies that pay high tax rates. Trump wants a 15% corporate tax rate. House Republican lawmakers propose a 20% rate. But even a reduction to 25% would boost S&P 500 Index

                                   earnings by 8%, say analysts at Goldman Sachs. As an added plus, many of the high-tax-rate companies also generate most, or all, of their sales at home. That makes them less vulnerable to steps to penalize importers and bigger direct beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus. Stocks to consider because they pay the highest effective tax rates, according to Goldman Sachs, include: Goodyear Tire & Rubber

For now, it’s probably better to stay away from this group, as a Trump play. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword,” says Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. It’s also tough to know at this point which defense programs and services will get priority, says Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi. For now it’s probably best to simply monitor the group for trading opportunities. Lockheed fell hard on Dec. 23 when Trump tweeted negatively about F-35 program costs. But it then went on to post 4% gains in two weeks as it recovered from the Trump twitter storm. Infrastructure plays This group is another tough one. Yes, our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling. You see this all the time when you drive around. And Trump’s plan to boost infrastructure spending would no doubt help this space, especially materials companies like Vulcan Materials

                                    SUM, +2.41% But infrastructure plays face three challenges. 1. The earliest the industry could see any measurable spending benefit from Trump policies would be 2018, said economists Kermit Baker of the American Institute of Architects and Ken Simonson at the Associated General Contractors of America at a lunch recently sponsored by Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy. But it’s more likely to arrive in 2019. That’s a long way off. 2. Trump’s immigration policies could aggravate the construction labor shortage. Immigrants make up 30% of construction labor. 3. The group has rallied a lot, despite those challenges. “Our concern is that something will break investor euphoria,” says Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Indeed, this is a risk for all “Trump plays” and the market in general. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5% since Election Day, which means investors have priced in a lot of Trump success. If he stumbles at all in his legislative agenda, the market could reverse itself, especially because investor sentiment is so high. But as we saw during the campaign, Trump has a way of getting what he wants. So any reversal in the market, and especially the names above, on a Trump stumble will probably be a buying opportunity.

541,,2022017,Reuters,1262017,"The world’s largest publicly traded oil producer wrote down the book value of part of its North American natural gas and crude reserves, some of which were acquired in 2009’s all-stock buyout of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time. After conducting an annual asset review, Exxon said the value of some reserves in North America’s Rocky Mountain region should be lowered due to weak performance and its own tepid outlook on the potential for future commodity price rises. Exxon declined to provide its internal forecast for oil and gas prices. Exxon will report estimates for the value of its proved reserves in February. The $2 billion impairment charge likely will reduce the value of the proved reserves. Wall Street traders expect oil prices to stay near their current range, between $54 and $55 per barrel, for several years and for natural gas prices to remain near their current level, about $3.13 per million cubic feet. <0#CLCAL:> NG12Mst The 14 percent boost in capital expenditures and the writedown reflect a delicate balancing act by oil and natural gas companies in an era of extreme volatility after a two-year price rout. The higher spending is not due to rising prices for oilfield contract work or other services, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon’s vice president of investor relations, said on an earnings conference call with investors. “It is, by an large, a function of activity level” increasing, Woodbury said. Exxon’s announcement came after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. The results reflected the slow and steady improvement in the global oil and gas industry as commodity prices inch higher after a two-year rout. The quarterly report was Exxon’s first under Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. Rex Tillerson, the former CEO, has been nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be secretary of state and is awaiting confirmation. Fourth-quarter earnings fell to $1.68 billion, or 41 cents per share, from $2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding the $2 billion writedown, Exxon earned 90 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production fell 3 percent to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this month Exxon said it would pay up to $6.6 billion to double its holdings in the oil-rich Permian Basin of west Texas, the largest oil field in the United States. Shares of Texas-based Exxon fell 1.7 percent to $83.40 in afternoon trading. ","

542,Tom DiChristopher,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Exxon Mobil beat earnings forecasts on Tuesday as revenues increased, though the company took a $2 billion impairment charge, mostly due to lowering the value of some of its U.S. gas assets. Excluding one-time items, Exxon reported a fourth-quarter profit of 90 cents a share, versus Wall Street expectations of 70 cents a share. Results for the Irving, Texas-based oil giant were helped by belt-tightening throughout 2016. However, persistently low oil prices and weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business weighed on earnings for the full year. ""Financial results for the year were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in commodity prices and the impairment charge,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. Shares of Exxon slipped about 1 percent Tuesday. Evercore analyst Doug Teresson said many market watchers were focused on the charge. Including that impairment, Exxon would have missed profit forecasts. ""The market did view the result negatively because they missed the headline number, but that's really only because of ... impairments for Exxon, which are non-recurring. And so the clean results were actually similar to consensus, but they were just messy,"" he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report."" Excluding that charge, Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.7 billion, or 90 cents a share. In the period a year ago, it reported earnings of $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share. Revenues for the most recent quarter were $61.01 billion, compared with expectations of $62.28 billion. Exxon said it will increase its 2017 capital spending program, which includes exploration, to an estimated $22 billion. In 2016, capital spending fell 38 percent to $19.3 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from a year ago in all three of the company's major segments: exploration and production, refining and chemicals. The $2 billion impairment resulted from the company's review of its reserves. Exxon determined that some of its U.S. assets' future cash flows no longer exceeded their carrying value. These were primarily in the Rockies. Exxon warned last quarter it would have to revise the amount of unproduced resources it holds if oil prices remained low through the end of the year. In the current price environment, the resources would no longer qualify as proven reserves under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company said at the time. Liquid petroleum products fetched a higher price than they did a year ago. That was partially offset by weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon have seen their refining margins shrink as the price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels, stabilizes above $50 a barrel. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry — improved significantly from last year. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. Cash flow from asset sales was also higher, hitting $2.1 billion, versus about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last week, the company announced a dividend of 75 cents, unchanged from the third quarter. ",Exxon Mobil profit and revenue rise as the oil giant takes $2 billion impairment,0.9556
543,Tom DiChristopher,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Shares of Chevron gave up about 2 percent of their value in pre-market trading Friday as the oil giant turned in quarterly results that badly missed estimates. Chevron executives pointed to lower margins in its refining business and tax charges as drags on earnings during a conference call. They also said layoffs were largely behind them, but the company would continue looking for ways to drive down costs. The company also said it will be able to fund spending and dividends in 2017 with cash generated from operations, following a downturn that forced oil giants and smaller drillers alike to tap debt and other to sources to pay for normal business operations. ""Our 2016 earnings reflect the low oil and gas prices we saw during the year,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement. ""We responded aggressively to those conditions, cutting capital and operating expenses by $14 billion."" Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said on the conference call Chevron is considering more assets sales. ""Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017,"" she said. Last month, the company said it would lower its capital spending for a fourth consecutive year. Chevron's $19.8 billion program for 2017 will focus on projects with shorter cycles and higher returns aimed at producing oil and gas within two years. That includes more drilling in the the U.S. Permian basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, which is leading the nation's shale oil recovery, Watson said. The company said it was operating 10 oil rigs in the region and planning to add another about every eight weeks, he said on Friday. Chevron also provided updates on its critical Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, which experienced some shutdowns in 2016, as well as its Wheatstone natural gas hub. Watson acknowledged the first phase of Gorgon's ramp-up missed expectations and said Chevron would apply those lessons to future phases there and at Wheatstone. He said the next phase of Gorgon would start processing LNG early in the second quarter. Phase one of Wheatstone is scheduled for mid-2017, with phase two expected six to eight months later. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $415 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had expected Chevron to earn 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. In the year-ago period, Chevron reported a loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, shortly before oil prices hit 12-year lows. Low crude oil and gas prices throughout much of 2016 pushed the oil giant to a loss for the year. For 2016, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million, or 27 cents a share. Cash flow, a key measure of corporate health in the oil and gas industry, was $12.8 billion in 2016, down from $19.5 billion the previous year. Chevron spent $22.4 billion on capital projects and exploration last year, down from $34 billion in 2015, reflecting the industry trend of reducing expenses to weather the downturn. Chevron saw results improve from the year-ago period in its upstream business, which includes exploration and production of fossil fuels. The company chalked that up to lower exploration and operating expenses and its oil and gas fetching a higher price. Oil prices stabilized above $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter after OPEC and other major oil producers agreed to cut production. In the downstream segment, which includes refining and marketing fuel, Chevron saw fourth-quarter profits slide both in the United States and abroad. The company broke even in its U.S. downstream business, compared with profits of $496 million a year ago. Integrated oil companies such as Chevron have seen their refining margins shrink on the rising price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 7 percent from sales of $28 billion a year ago. On Wednesday, the San Ramon, California-based oil giant announced a quarterly dividend of $1.08 a share, unchanged from the previous quarter, when it hiked the shareholder payout by a penny.

544,Fred Imbert,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Monday, notching their worst day of the year, as a new measure taken by the Trump administration on immigration sent jitters through the market. President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday that would temporarily bar entry into the U.S. to Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens. The order seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. In signing the order, Trump said he pledged to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America."" ""We spent the first two months [following the election] focusing on the positives for companies. What we're seeing here is  that life is not a straight line,"" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. ""Perhaps the market is looking at the other side of things. Maybe the Trump administration is not going to do all the things businesses want."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell around 120 points after sliding more than 223.39 points, dropping below 20,000, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent, with energy shedding 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling 0.8 percent. ""I think it also has to do with what the immigration policy represents [in terms of] the way the Trump administration is going to operate,"" said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. ""The fact is that you've got a major policy that was implemented very quickly. That's causing uncertainty."" The order sparked outrage as thousands took to the streets across the U.S. in protest. Several world and corporate leaders also condemned the order. On Saturday, a federal judge issued an emergency stay to halt the deportation of people with valid visas who landed in the U.S. ""The Trump worries are now beginning to set in,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. ""We're having this ongoing worry effect that could overtake earnings and economic data."" The U.S. stock market has seen a massive rally since Trump's election, with the S&P and Dow advancing 7.25 percent and 9.61 percent since Nov. 8, respectively. ""You're coming off all-time highs on virtually every index,"" said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds. ""It doesn't take much for people to take a breather."" Traders have bet on Trump's promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation that would boost growth, just as earnings have begun growing again. ""While investors were very quick to price in the expected impact that deregulation, infrastructure spending and job growth could have on the U.S. economy, I find it very difficult to believe that after pricing in heavy premiums based on fiscal promises, that investors are not now reconsidering what damage Trump might do by implementing other promises that supplemented an incoherent and ranting political campaign,"" said Jameel Ahmad, vice president of research at FXTM. ""Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the U.S.,"" Ahmad said. In economic news, pending home sales for December rose 1.6 percent, while personal income rose 0.3 percent, below an expected increase of 0.4 percent. The data releases come a day before the Federal Reserve kicks off its first monetary policy meeting of the year. The central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percent at its December meeting. However, market expectations for a rate following this meeting are just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""I'm as enthused as anyone about tax cuts (even though we don't know what final form will look like) and regulatory relief (but worried about trade protectionism and immigration bans),"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. ""But to think that somehow the Fed is no longer relevant to both the economy and markets as they step up rate hikes I think is delusional,"" Boockvar said. U.S. Treasurys were mostly steady, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding near 2.496 percent and the short-term two-year note yield around 1.22 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.069 and the yen around 113.7. In corporate news, earnings season continues this week as the likes of Exxon Mobil, Apple, Facebook and UPS get set to report quarterly results. European stocks traded broadly lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.05 percent. In Asia, stocks also fell, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 dropping 0.51 percent. The Shanghai equity market was closed for the Chinese New Year holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.65 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 19,971.13, with Caterpillar leading decliners and Wal-Mart the top advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 13.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 2,280.90, with energy leading all nine sectors lower and consumer staples and utilities advancing. The Nasdaq composite slid 47.07 points, or 0.83 percent, to close 5,613.71. About three stocks declined for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 873.13 million and a composite volume of 3.585 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, rose 12.5 percent to around 11.9. Gold futures for April delivery rose $4.90 to settle at $1,196 an ounce.

545,Rebecca Ungarino,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Energy, the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, could see further pain. Chevron, one of the top-weighted holdings in a popular energy ETF (the XLE) fell nearly 2 percent on Monday after posting disappointing quarterly earnings Friday, and Exxon Mobil and Schlumberger closed down about 1 percent each. Crude oil, which has generally moved in tandem with energy names for the last year, has fallen 2 percent in 2017. In a note Monday, Miller Tabak managing director Matt Maley said the XLE is nearing a critical multiyear trend line that if broken could mean the energy sector ""is getting quite close to a compelling decline."" In addition, some strategists noted, futures traders' crude oil positions as expressed in commitment of trader data are at historic extremes, with their longest positions on record. This is quite the contrarian indicator, Maley wrote, as the ""specs"" are ""almost always wrong at extremes."" ""In other words, there are A LOT of people on the bullish side of the boat in crude oil,"" Maley wrote, while ""commercials"" in the energy space have their largest short positions ever. The extreme positioning gives pause to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who sees downside ahead for energy. ""Now when you talk about energy stocks, you have to remember it was the best-performing sector last year, but most of that was a function of a reversal of it being the worst-performing sector for much of 2014 and 2015. And the bulk of that gain came in the early part of last year. So if you weren't overweight energy stocks by April, you missed out on most of the outperformance,"" Krinsky said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" And now, Krinsky said, the opposite is occurring; the XLE relative to the S&P 500 as well as on an absolute basis is beginning to break down below its uptrend line back to early 2015, echoing some of Maley's sentiment. However, Eddy Elfenbein, editor of the Crossing Wall Street blog, likes energy at this juncture in light of recently agreed-upon production cuts from OPEC.   ""I think it's just an unwinding of some of the recent trades. I mean, oil has had a spectacular year since the lows of about a year ago,"" Elfenbein said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""    The XLE is up 25 percent in the last year. Elfenbein noted the energy sector's poor performance over the last seven weeks or so, but sees upside in roughly six months to a year as crude oil production cuts will take some time to play out.    ""The key, this is the big game changer is that the OPEC cuts that they announced in November, these were the first major cuts in eight years, they're actually working. OPEC… they never cooperate. And it really is working this time,"" Elfenbein said, adding that such cuts had put a ""floor"" of sorts at the $50 a barrel level.     Still, the technicals in Krinsky's eyes don't appear promising.   ""We don't think it's going to be anything like we saw in 2015, but [the] XLE probably has some more downside, lower to mid-60s,"" Krinsky said, adding that although the ETF is still well above its 200-day moving average, the extreme positions are reason enough to believe underperformance will continue in the near term.

ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) peers have written down and impaired the value of several of their assets since the beginning of this oil and gas downturn, but ExxonMobil had not yet done so. That changed this past quarter when the company took a $2 billion hit to the bottom line. Despite that large asset charge, ExxonMobil's results weren't all that bad. Let's take a look at the numbers to see why the fourth quarter should give some hope for the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: ExxonMobil earnings release. * In millions, except per-share data. Last quarter, management gave everyone a heads-up that we should expect a sizable asset writedown this quarter. Well, we got it. Management took a $2.02 billion asset impairment, mostly related to its dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains. This is a little bit of a surprise, actually. Based on the statement last quarter about taking oil and gas reserves off the books, there was the assumption that assets like its Canadian oil sands would be impaired. This writedown is pretty revealing, though. Management does writedowns based on discounted cash flows for those assets and the current carrying values of those assets. So reading the tea leaves into this impairment charge, we can come to two conclusions: The long life aspect of Canadian oil sands means that their asset value may not face as much risk as many might assume, and that there has been a permanent structural shift in natural gas production and pricing in the U.S. Aside from that one big change, the rest of ExxonMobil's results were par for the course. Downstream and chemical results suffered slightly from rising crude oil prices that impacted feedstock costs for these segments, and some favorable tax-related items gave its corporate segment a rare gain. DATA SOURCE:  EXXONMOBIL EARNINGS RELEASES. CHART BY AUTHOR. The one bright spot in the quarter was ExxonMobil's cash from operations. The $7.4 billion in cash was more than enough to cover its $4.8 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, but fell just short of also covering the $3.1 billion in dividend payments. The $2.1 billion in asset sales helped to make up for the rest without having to take on any additional debt, something few integrated oil and gas companies have been able to do lately. Management quickly put that excess cash generation to work as it reduced total debt by $3.4 billion to $42.8 billion. Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury gave his typical ""just the facts"" conference call, where he pointed out on multiple occasions that the company was generating more cash from operations than its capital budget. He said: ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day and maintain focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015, as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to push -- pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance, combined with continued investment and cost discipline, generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion, and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered the dividend and net investments in the business. ExxonMobil's results, even adding in the large asset impairment, weren't that bad. The big asset charge hides the fact that the company's cash generation has improved significantly compared to the prior quarter and portends a much better 2017. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of ExxonMobil, its analyst day presentation is on March 1, where it will go into detail about its production and spending outlook for the next several years.

    ExxonMobil's Earnings Slip on a Rare Writedown -- The Motley Fool

  ",0.992
547,Tyler Crowe,2022017,Fool,1262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

548,Rich Smith,2022017,Fool,1262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

549,Barbara Kollmeyer,2022017,MarketWatch,1262017,"Published: Jan 31, 2017 3:39 p.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By Traders begging for nonpresidential drivers may get exactly that today, thanks to Apple and the start of a Fed meeting. “This week was supposed to be dominated by central banks’ decisions, earnings, and economic data from across the globe, but with Donald Trump in office, nothing seems capable of taking the spotlight from the White House.” That was FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed in a note that pretty much nails the mood. The jitters look set to stick around today, with some youngsters in for a #SaturdayNightMasscare history-refresher after Trump sent a defiant attorney general packing: Much debate now surrounds just when to start worrying about politics in earnest, and Sayed has one answer: “The major risk looming now is the breakup of the Republican coalition, although this doesn’t seem to be the case for now. I believe it’s going to be the biggest risk to financial markets in the near future, as we end up with protectionist policies without the implementation of fiscal policies, thus triggering a sharp reversal in stocks worldwide.” Our call of the day echoes this a bit. From Macro Man blogger Macronick comes the warning that markets could be headed for an “escalator up, elevator down” selloff. And “even a garden-variety 5% dip in the S&P would feel pretty vicious,” given the subdued state of volatility over the last two months, the blogger adds. If the Trump administration “overplays its hand,” eroding its relationship with the GOP, its much-anticipated infrastructure spending and tax-cut programs could get delayed or downsized, Macronick says. Then, harking back to the debt-ceiling shock of 2011, a prolonged political upset could start to hit growth and business confidence. Next would come a reflation reversal for stocks. While we’re not there yet, there’s plenty of time for more fireworks, says Macronick. “Investors have been viewing Trump as a second coming of Reagan,” the blogger adds. “They should remember his presidency may yet end up bearing much in common with Nixon’s—a period marked by widespread civil unrest and extreme animosity between the White House and press.” To be sure, strategists have been warning about Trump-inspired selling for a while, and the market has instead scored records.

The stock rose 6.6 percent to 6,795 pence as of 0920 GMT, making it the top gainer on the FTSE 100 index .FTSE Dublin-based DCC, which gets nearly half of its profit from Britain and Ireland, has been expanding into western Europe in recent years through acquisitions. Esso’s retail petrol station network has 142 company-operated sites and contracts to supply 108 Esso-branded dealer-owned stations, DCC said. The business will be integrated into DCC’s energy unit and DCC will sign a long-term supply agreement with Esso Norge. The acquisition is “high quality” and “meaningful”, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note, citing expected return on acquisition capital of nearly 15 percent in the first full year of ownership. The firm has an “overweight” rating on the stock. The transaction is expected to close in the final calendar quarter of 2017, the company said. The Norwegian acquisition follows DCC’s deal in November to buy a 97 percent stake in French natural gas retail and marketing business, Gaz Europeen, for an enterprise value of 110 million euros (96 million pounds). Separately, DCC said on Tuesday the group operating profit for the third quarter ended Dec.31, 2016 was “strongly ahead” of the prior year and in line with its expectations, helped by strong performance of its energy unit.

553,Tyler Crowe,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

554,Rich Smith,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

556,,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"BRIGHTON, Colo. (Reuters) - The Colorado man arrested for fatally shooting three people in a Walmart in suburban Denver made his initial court appearance on Friday. Scott Ostrem, 47, was captured on Thursday, the day after he “nonchalantly” entered the Thornton, Colorado, Walmart and opened fire on shoppers and employees shortly after 6 p.m. MDT (midnight GMT), police said. Thornton is about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of downtown Denver. Wearing a light blue jail jumpsuit and faded red flip flops, Ostrem, in handcuffs and shackles, said yes four times when Judge Ted Tow asked if he understood his rights during the 10-minute hearing at the Adams County District Court in Brighton, Colorado. The judge ordered that Ostrem continue to be held without bond in the Adams County jail. Formal filing of charges will be made at the next hearing on Monday. Adams County District Attorney Dave Young said “multiple counts” would be filed. He declined to discuss specifics of the case, but said he had met with victims’ families after the hearing. “They are all shattered and in shock,” he said. Tow denied a request by Ostrem’s attorney, public defender Emily Fleischmann, to have police again close off the Walmart store where the shooting occurred to prevent the destruction of evidence, saying he lacked the authority to order that. The store has not reopened, said Fleischmann, who did not speak to reporters after the hearing. Two men were killed in the shooting and a woman who was shot died at a local hospital, police said. No one else was wounded. The victims were identified as Pamela Marques, 52, Carlos Moreno, 66 and Victor Vasquez, 26. Moreno’s family attended the hearing. They were carrying a sign that read “#Justice4CarlosMoreno,” but it was not allowed in the courtroom. They declined to talk to reporters. Police said they have yet to establish a motive for the rampage and that Ostrem had only “a minimal criminal history.” Early accounts of multiple casualties revived painful memories for the Denver area. In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people at a midnight screening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises” at a theater in the suburb of Aurora. The shooter, James Holmes, is serving a dozen consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. In 1999, two 12th-graders fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher at Columbine High School in suburban Jefferson County. The pair, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, then committed suicide in the campus library. ","

557,,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"BRIGHTON, Colo. (Reuters) - A Colorado man who prosecutors say walked into a Walmart store in a Denver suburb and opened fire seemingly at random, killing three people, was charged on Monday with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Scott Ostrem, 47, was told during a brief hearing in Adams County District Court in Brighton that he had been charged with six counts of murder and 30 counts of attempted murder. The six murder counts include two for each slain victim, under different legal theories. No one else was wounded in the attack, but prosecutors said the attempted murder charges referred to other people in the store who could have been struck by gunfire. The charges could make Ostrem eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted. Adams County District Attorney Dave Young told reporters outside court that he had not decided whether to seek it. “The (victims’) families will certainly be a part of that determination,” Young said, adding that additional charges could be filed in the case. The defendant, who was shackled and dressed in yellow and white jail garb, gave one-word answers to the judge. He did not enter a plea. Police said they had yet to establish a motive for the rampage last Wednesday, which took place amid a string of U.S. mass shootings that have renewed calls for restrictions on gun ownership. Early accounts of multiple casualties also revived painful memories for the Denver area. In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people at a midnight screening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises” at a theater in the suburb of Aurora. The shooter, James Holmes, is serving a dozen consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.

The holiday shopping season, which runs through Christmas on Dec. 25, can account for as much as 40 percent of retailers’ annual sales. Steve Bratspies, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising officer, told reporters on a conference call that the retailer is prepared to draw in shoppers this holiday season. “We know the categories and items customers are looking for, have focused our assortment on those top items, pricing them so we cannot be beat and buying deep to ensure more availability,” he said.

565,Lauren Thomas,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Wal-Mart isn't making any big changes to its Black Friday store hours this year, as some other retailers have, and you won't need a wristband to snag the biggest deals. In line with last year, the big-box retailer's website on turkey day will kick off its online Black Friday sale at 12:01 a.m. ET. That's hours before its in-store doorbuster deals begin at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving evening. Wal-Mart stores will remain open all day Friday. Select deals will also go live on Walmart.com this Thursday. Those deals, available until Nov. 12, include an Acer Aspire ES Laptop for $449, a Sky Rider Falcon 2 Pro Drone for $29.97, and a Kingsford 32-inch charcoal grill for $99. This marks the third year Wal-Mart has offered a majority of its Black Friday promotions online, as consumers are increasingly dividing their budgets between stores and the web. Last year's  Adobe Digital Index Report showed consumers spent $91.7 billion online in the U.S. alone, an 11 percent jump from the year before. This year, Adobe is projecting that number to surpass $100 billion. And for the 2017 holidays, consumers are expected for the first time to spend more of their budgets online than in stores, according to an annual survey by Deloitte. Internet sites and mass merchants remain shoppers' favored destinations, but e-retailers are widening their lead over other formats, Deloitte found. ""What [shoppers] buy will be largely determined by the digital interactions occurring now,"" said Rod Sides, leader of Deloitte's U.S. retail, wholesale and distribution team. Retailers including Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, Kohl's, Target and Sears are, in turn, beefing up their online offerings ahead of the holidays. New this year, Wal-Mart will no longer be handing out wristbands in advance of Black Friday for coveted items like TVs and iPads. In 2014, Wal-Mart called its holiday strategy the ""New Black Friday,"" where it hoped to trim back the number of shoppers standing in line for ""nothing."" But that method was short-lived. ""We feel good about inventory"" this year, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said on a call with the media. ""We don't think we need wristbands this year."" Some of Wal-Mart's top Black Friday deals in 2017 include a Hatchimals Golden Lynx Egg for $49.88, a Frozen Sleigh 12-Volt Ride-On for $198, a Samsung 65-inch Class Curved 4K Smart TV for $998, the Google Home Mini for $29 — which also comes with a $25 shopping coupon — and the PlayStation 4 1TB Console for $199. Bratspies said Wal-Mart has stocked enough kids pajamas this holiday season to reach from Miami to Seattle. Best Buy, a close competitor to Wal-Mart in the electronics department, is set to open its doors on Thanksgiving at 5 p.m., as it did last year.

566,Zack Guzman,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"It seems too easy to be true that you could make millions by raiding the clearance aisle at your local Walmart or Target and then selling your haul on Amazon. But that's exactly what 28-year-old Ryan Grant is doing. Only four years after quitting his accounting job in Minneapolis, Minn., to flip purchases full-time, his business is making well into the six figures in profits per year. ""Pretty early on I realized I wasn't in the career path that I wanted to be on,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""That experience really had me looking for other options and I was starting to explore ways that I could basically leave that job and have my own schedule and be on my own time."" To do that, Grant turned to the side hustle he had used to made ends meet in college. As a student at Winona State University, he organized textbook buyback events on campus twice a year. He listed the books on Amazon and shipped them out to customers around the country for a profit of up to $10,000 a year. The process worked simply enough: Using the Amazon Seller app he could see exactly how much he could expect to profit on each book and in what time frame. But the hours spent processing and packaging each order himself proved to be a bit much. ""Going through that process for one semester was enough to know that I didn't want to do it again,"" he says. ""From there forward I did Fulfillment by Amazon the rest of the way."" Using Amazon's fulfillment services meant he could ship all the books in bulk using preferred UPS rates to an Amazon warehouse, where, for a fee, the online retailer handled processing and shipping out each individual order. It made his side hustle more manageable, time-wise. And, when Grant grew more unfulfilled at his accounting job, it sparked the idea of going online to flip more than just textbooks. After work and on the weekends, he scoped out the clearance aisles at Walmart, scanned a few items using Amazon's app and bought up toys, games, and home improvement items he realized he could re-sell for a profit. A receipt from his early days shows a variety of purchases, everything from vacuums to Barbies, LEGO sets to stainless steel flatware. ""I was putting in about 10 hours per week and I was making in the ballpark of $1,000 per month,"" he recalls. Once he was able to make the same kind of money reselling on Amazon as he had made at his accounting job, in September 2013, he quit. ""I was confident that if I had full-time hours to dedicate to selling online that I would be able to more or less scale that up,"" Grant says. Just three months later, in December, he notched $9,000 in profit on over $25,000 in total sales. ""Making that amount of money in one month was a big boost in my confidence to be able to scale up further from there,"" he says. Boxes upon boxes destined for Amazon warehouses started stacking up in Grant's duplex so, in the spring of 2014, he rented out a 725-foot warehouse. He packed his Mazda 626 full of products on runs back and forth from other brand-name retailers like Target and Toys R Us. ""It was starting to basically take over my life because I'm coming home and there's product all over my house,"" he recalls. When the 30 hours of shopping and the 15 hours of preparing shipments each week became too much to handle alone, Grant hired his first employee, a friend who could help scour local stores. Eventually it got easier to target the items that had the biggest opportunity for arbitrage. Seasonality, they realized, was a key factor. They could, for example, buy up discounted candy after Halloween and half-priced Christmas decorations around the New Year. ""Believe it or not, there's actually people buying those items out of season,"" Grant laughs. Still, even he was surprised at how quickly the business took off from there. ""I went from just me in this business doing around three-to-five thousand dollars in sales per month and now, four years later, we're a team of 11 and we're doing well over $200,000 in sales per month,"" Grant says. The team had to move to a warehouse that's over five times as large as their first this past July. Since he started selling on Amazon, Grant says the business is on track to top $8 million in total sales by the end of this year. Profits are heavily reinvested back into the company, though Grant was still able to take a salary of around $150,000 when he was working for the venture full time. The team also made mistakes made along the way. They lost $6,000 when a faulty nail filing product for dogs got Grant's Amazon seller account temporarily suspended, for example. They also had to pay the fees Amazon charges for products that failed to sell and sat idly in Amazon's warehouses. All the same, Grant believes he has found an easy and effective formula for success. ""I think anyone can do it if they're willing to put in the work,"" he says. As his business is increasingly run by his team, Grant has reduced his salary down to $60,000 a year and now dedicates much of his time to getting that message out. He consults and teaches e-commerce classes through the same blog he has been using to track his performance. His hope is that he might be able to help a few people who might not be happy at their jobs find the same independence he did. ""I was just looking to have freedom of schedule and replace the income that I had from that job and now it's turned into a lot more than that,"" he says. ""I mean, I would be sitting in an office cubicle now or working at a client location as opposed to doing what I want to do effectively when I want to do it."" —Video by CNBC's Zack Guzman Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

567,Steve Odland and Ethan Cramer-Flood,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"As Donald Trump prepares to meet China's president Xi Jinping, a lightning rod of 2017 is on his  agenda: trade. Populist politicians have long opined on how U.S. trade policies with China have hurt certain American constituencies – namely, small businesses and factory workers. While these accusations largely ring true, the current protectionist policies under consideration risk generating blowback for another important economic faction: large American multinational corporations, which play a significant role in driving the U.S. economy. If a trade war unfolded, this constituency would stand to lose the most. Many of America's biggest brands have considerable investment footprints in China: Nike, Walmart, Apple – the list goes on. These companies would stand at the front of the firing line if China reciprocated against any major trade actions by the U.S. Depending on the nature of the retaliation, expect revenues, profits, and share prices to suffer. Collateral impacts would include company workers in America, local economies where the companies reside, and the pension and retirement fund holdings invested in them. The risks involved run deeper than reciprocal tariffs and trade restrictions. At the heart of corporate America's concern is future access to the Chinese market. Already, China is heading in the wrong direction here, as its policy environment has become increasingly hostile to the private sector and the foreign investors within it. A trade war could be the final straw that leads Beijing to severely contain American corporate interests in China, if not close off the market altogether. For many U.S. companies, China is their No.2 market and revenue-generator in the world. For some, it is already No.1. Therefore, any new barriers that emerge from a trade war domino effect would devastate American business. On both sides, economic hostility has been driven recently by accusations, counter-accusations, and ongoing investigations into China's practice of coercing American companies to hand over advanced technology and other intellectual property as a price for doing business. The U.S. Trade Representative's ongoing investigation into these shenanigans has illuminated the ways China's regulators railroad U.S. corporations. During open hearings in October, voice after voice recounted examples of American firms essentially forced into disadvantageous commercial arrangements with Chinese partners – the localization of customer data, software source codes, core intellectual property rights – because Chinese law often requires such provisions before regulators will grant operating rights. Why do major American companies allow themselves to be perennially manipulated by the Chinese government into forgoing their hard-earned innovations? Because Beijing is masterful at playing one company against the other, and Chinese leaders know multinational corporations cannot resist the lure of China's consumers. Thus, companies compromise to gain access, for fear if they don't play ball someone else will. Adding to the complications, American multinationals also find themselves dealing with an administration focused more on investments inside the U.S. and less on supporting U.S. industry abroad. For example, negotiations over a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) have gone moribund, despite a U.S.-China BIT arguably ranking as corporate America's top policy priority in the relationship. Moreover, many multinational corporations thought the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be a strong bulwark to help normalize China's trade and investment practices. Despite the uncertainty on the U.S. side, America has more opportunity to push back on China's leaders than it did a decade ago. The days of China's double-digit growth figures are gone, permanently, making the risk of heightened tensions less dangerous for business than in the past. China is no longer a wonderland of easy growth and easy profits, so some leverage has shifted back to American negotiators. Additionally, China's investments abroad have skyrocketed – particularly in the U.S. – creating a mutual incentive for keeping doors open. This week in Beijing, some pushing from the Trump side could help in cajoling China into improving market-access conditions for foreign companies. However, if threats and heated rhetoric turn into painful protectionist U.S. policies down the road, ""face issues"" for China would likely come into play and lead Beijing to institute retaliatory actions – step one towards a trade war. It behooves American business to ensure its voice is heard now and heard clearly, without the mixed messages of the past. In this way, the populist proposals kicking around Washington can be handled moderately, to help bring about positive change rather than a downward spiral.

""Activision is a high momentum stock and it does warrant a buy rating in our work,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""The thing with these high momentum stocks is they could do nothing for months at a time, but the longer-term strength ultimately continues higher and I think that's what's going on for Activision."" While the video game maker has traded between $60 and $66 since July, Wald pointed to three key factors that he thinks will ultimately get the stock to break out. ""Our bet is that given the positive momentum, the rising 200-day moving average and top-down tail winds from a relatively broadly structured tech sector, we think it is more likely that you get an upside breakout than a downside break,"" he added. But not everyone is as excited about the gaming stock.

571,Jordan Novet,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Facebook is trying to show that it's serious about snagging business users, and Dreamforce is the place to do it. On Tuesday, the company talked up its Workplace by Facebook offering at Salesforce's annual software conference in San Francisco. While Facebook's core business is ads that target consumers, the company doesn't want to cede the work market to Slack, Microsoft and HipChat from Atlassian. Facebook said in a blog post that it's teaming up with Salesforce to improve its Workplace service, which is a version of the social network that's designed for use by working teams. The partnership, first announced in April, is designed to bring Salesforce's enterprise software tools into Facebook. In particular, Facebook is focused on making collaboration smoother by integrating Salesforce's Quip word processing and spreadsheet tools. There will be buttons for uploading documents to Quip as well as creating new documents, along with a list of all available files. ""These improvements will make it easier for teams collaborate, edit, and work together on documents,"" Facebook wrote in the blog post. ""So they can work faster and get more done."" Workplace by Facebook also has integrations with Box, Dropbox, Google's G Suite and Microsoft's Office and OneDrive. Facebook introduced the app in 2015 and said last month that 30,000 organizations, including Walmart, are using it. Working with Salesforce on Quip is a natural move for Facebook.

572,Heidi Chung,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Snap is soaring ahead of its earnings Tuesday after the bell, and traders are expecting an even bigger move for the stock following its report. Since Snap's IPO on March 2, shares have fallen more than 12 percent. As the company gears up for its third earnings report as a public company, the options market is implying about a 13 percent move in either direction. Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com pointed out on CNBC's ""Options Action"" on Monday that after past earnings reports, Snap shares fell steeply the following day. The stock tumbled 21 percent the day following its first report and 14 percent following its second report. In comparison, rival Twitter also saw very large moves following its first two earnings reports. Shares dropped 24 percent following its first earnings report in February 2014 and then fell 9 percent after its second report. Meanwhile, Facebook's stock sunk 12 percent after its first earnings release, but then jumped 19 percent after its second. Nathan pointed out that the implied move of about 13 percent, or $2, could potentially place the stock at around $17. ""If you look at this chart, $17 is significant. That was the IPO price, [and] that was also the September high. That $2 from here looks to be resistance, [and] the September low is also $2 lower.""On Monday, the most active strikes were the Nov. 10 weekly 20 and 21 calls, meaning traders see Snap shares closing above $20 by Friday, which is 30 percent higher than Tuesday's trading price.According to FactSet, analysts are expecting Snap to report an earnings loss of 33 cents on $237 million of revenue.

573,Michelle Castillo,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"With so many apps out there, it's hard to get noticed. ""When you have over 2 million apps in the iOS app store, how you get your app downloaded verses other apps becomes important,"" said Amir Ghodrati, director of market insights for App Annie. Developers have come up with tactics to get their apps to number one in Apple's App Store and Google Play, the store for Android devices. Here are some tricks App Annie has noticed. Users are likely to download the first result when they are searching for a specific app. Sixty-five percent of app downloads come from searches in the App Store, according to App Annie. ""With iOS search ads introduced last year, people are basically looking for key words they think are going to be popular and then paying money to pay to rank to the top spot,"" Ghodrati said. Many companies buy their own names in order to ensure they have the top spot. Smaller companies might use popular companies to boost their popularity, such as Motif Fashion & Jewelry buying an ad on the term ""Etsy."" Occasionally, rivals will purchase a competitor's name in order to appear above the official app in search results, such as Walmart advertising on the ""Target"" search term: Or  Amazon advertising on the ""Walmart"" search term: Or Lyft advertising for drivers on the ""Uber"" search term. App Annie noticed many apps changing their name or image icon to fit seasonal events like Christmas, Halloween or Valentine's Day. However, the most popular event to inspire a name change is Black Friday. A coupon and local deal app called Retale updated its name to ""Black Friday 2016: Ads, Shopping Deals & Coupons"" a few weeks before the big shopping day. It rose from number 7 to number 3 in its category and retained third place through Cyber Monday, according to App Annie. Over the week of Black Friday, Retale saw a 100 percent increase in daily downloads over the two prior weeks, App Annie noted. This season, Wal-Mart has updated its icon to a present, added snow to its screenshots and added the line ""Our elves have been hard at work so you'll save time during the holidays and every day"" to its version notes. The app description also updated to include information about free shipping and using your phone to pay at the store quickly. In order to reach the top spot, some apps will change their category to rank higher. Since there are so many social networking apps and Instagram and Snap dominate the category, many search for another affiliated vertical. For instance, Twitter switched from social networking to news in April 2016, and has since been leading the news category. There are always several buzz words floating around the tech scene. Thanks to the iPhone X, the app keyword search volume for ""augmented reality"" has gone up 25 percent month over month, according to App Annie. As a response, it saw many companies are adding the words ""augmented reality"" or specifically mentioning iOS 11 in their descriptions and functionalities. For example, Amazon's latest update highlights the fact it allows for augmented reality furniture placement so you can see products in your room before you buy them. But because so many developers are adding augmented reality to their descriptions, companies that use that term are finding it more difficult to rise in the ranks. It is 14 percent more difficult in the App Store and 37 percent harder in the Google Play store to move up spots by using ""augmented reality"" since the iPhone X was announced in September, App Annie said.

574,Thomas Franck,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"New research has found that U.S. retailers charge nearly identical prices across stores, despite wide variation in customer income and local demographics. And by holding prices steady across locations, retailers significantly increase the prices paid by poorer households relative to the rich as a percentage of total income. The uniform pricing also ends up costing firms nearly 7 percent of profits on average because they lose out on higher prices they could charge the wealthy and lower volume for lower-income consumers. In a working paper filed with the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists Stefano DellaVigna of UC Berkeley and Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University reported their findings. For the food stores studied, customers of stores in the lowest income decile pay about 0.7 percent higher prices than they would under flexible prices, while customers of stores in the top income decile pay roughly 9 percent lower prices, according to the research. Gentzkow, who's been a professor at Stanford for two years, underscored that classical economics predicts that companies adjust prices in response to surges or contractions in demand or income. That is, firms take advantage of people who want a particular good more than others and exploit populations with higher income levels. The researchers studied data from tens of thousands of stores in the Nielsen Retailer Scanner to extract information on weekly prices from firms while using Consumer Panel data from the University of Chicago to study customer income trends. The team focused on three store types: 9,415 food stores, 9,977 drugstores and 3,288 mass merchandise stores. ""We view this sharp contrast between within- and between-chain results as one of our key findings. It suggests that chains are either varying their prices for too little across stores in response to income, or varying their prices far too much at the overall chain level,"" wrote the economists in their paper. Their research found an increase in per capita income of $10,000 for localities — equivalent to a move from the 30th to the 75th percentile — is associated with an increase in price of just 0.72 percent. ""The thing that makes it surprising to us is that those stores typically have very different consumers,"" Gentzkow told CNBC in an interview. ""Econ 101 would tell you that inequality in incomes is going to be offset because poor people are going to end up paying lower prices."" The paper doesn't go into much on the reasons why retailers are charging the same everywhere, but it's likely that access to Amazon and Google pricing comparison tools on a consumer's smartphone is playing a role. DellaVigna and Gentzkow suggest it may have more to do with managers at chain stores being reluctant to adjust prices for their location. ""Change may impose additional costs, as managers may not be well incentivized to make the change, while fearing the cost if a change backfires,"" wrote the team. But stores may be reluctant to give that power to individual locations with Amazon available to ship anywhere easily at a lower price. ""I think it's plausible that if one of these stores said now were going to start varying the prices in their stores it would come at managerial costs,"" Gentzkow told CNBC. Plus ""people might be upset if they realize you were change the price in one store in not another."" Another important effect is that floating prices help mitigate the negative impact of local economic shocks; even when the population experiences a hit to income, reductions in local retail prices would naturally offset the damage. However, fixed prices as observed by the researchers diminish this helpful response. ","Retailers are charging the same prices across US, boosting income inequality, new research shows",-0.9496

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

577,John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump,0.8895

""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly.

Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable?

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

Source: Getty Images. If you could go back to the pre-industrial days of the 18th century, you'd see many things made of wood and stone and metal but nothing made of plastic. Today you can't get away from plastic if you tried. So, if you're thinking about investing in materials, why not invest in one with a history of growth and a stellar outlook? Plastic has conquered the world so thoroughly that it's difficult to actually define the plastic industry, as it has considerable overlap with the chemicals, energy, packaging, and consumer goods sectors. So let's consider only businesses that sell plastic to other businesses and exclude companies that use tons of plastic but are really in the consumer-goods sector. Here's a list of the largest publicly traded plastics manufacturers: Source: Yahoo Finance. The dirty secret behind plastic is that it's derived from fossil fuels. Natural-gas liquids such as ethane, for instance, are ""cracked"" to bring out olefins such as ethylene, which are then polymerized with other stuff to produce the many, almost infinite, varieties of plastic. If you haven't heard, there's been a ""shale revolution"" going on, and the world is awash in natural gas. The results are reverberating throughout the entire plastic production chain. Ethylene is now cheaper to make (cheaper energy costs, cheaper feedstock), and the past few years have seen a significant expansion in the production of both ethylene and polyethylene. Who gains from all this? Basically, the companies with pricing power -- the users of plastic. The less commoditized you are, the better off you'll be. A company like Lego or Hasbro will source plastic at a much better price without having to lower the retail price of its toys. For olefin producers such as LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) and Dow Chemical, it's a different story. A big part of their businesses are commoditized, and they're feeling the pressure to restructure. The Dow/DuPont merger should be seen in this light, as an attempt to carve out the higher margin segments from the rest of the business. LyondellBasell is present along the entire plastic production chain, from the refining of fossil fuels to the ""cracking"" of natural gas liquids and, of course, the actual fabrication of plastics. It's also the largest producer of ethylene in the United States; production of olefins (mainly ethylene and propylene) and polyolefins accounts for about 57% of its revenue. This is a volatile business that's exposed to a variety of prices -- not only crude oil and natural gas, but also ethane, naphtha, and, of course, ethylene and propylene. Revenue was down a whopping 28% last year. It's important to keep in mind, however, that virtually all of the dip was due to a drop in price and that volume was slightly up. The price of ethylene alone fell by 34% in the U.S. and propylene by 45%. But the cost of production also fell, so much so that earnings posted a record high. This kind of thing is not strange for a business like LyondellBasell, and that's why gross profit or EBITDA is a better measure of performance than revenue. LyondellBasell has a good balance sheet, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.9, but it's a recent Chapter 11 ""graduate"", and a watchful eye should be kept on its debt levels. At the moment, it's selling for about 7 times last year's earnings. That's cheap historically, but what makes the company really interesting is that it's a voracious buyer of its own stock. Since the end of 2013, it's reduced about a quarter of its share count. Part of the purchase has been financed with debt, but most of it has come from free cash flow. The risk with an investment like this is collapsing margins -- either a rise in feedstock prices, which can't be passed on to customers, or a fall in olefin and polyolefin prices without a corresponding fall in feedstock. The main feedstock for most U.S.-based ethylene producers is ethane, and there are some murmurings of a spike in ethane prices. It's also true that ethylene capacity will most likely expand over the coming years, all of which points to a worrying compression of margins. But all of this may be priced in, and long-term prospects may be sound, especially with the manageable debt and the extra juice from share buybacks. Going upstream to a company that's more a user of plastic than a producer of it is like taking a breath of fresh air -- the businesses are simpler, less volatile, and just better. AptarGroup (NYSE:ATR) is basically a packaging company. The fine-mist maker on your cologne bottle, pre-filled syringe components, and dispensing closures are some of its main products. Unlike LyondellBasell and its compatriots, AptarGroup is very steady in its earning power. In fact, I couldn't find the last time it's suffered a net loss. Its history is one of steady margins, moderate growth, strong free cash flow, and increasing dividends. It's a prime example of a rather boring business that happens to make good money. Aptar's margins have improved steadily over the past few years, helped by cheaper raw-material prices, and this trend may very well continue over the near future. But Aptar isn't cheap. At current prices, it's valued at about 24 times last year's earnings. Unless you think Aptar is due for some stellar growth, I would recommend you wait for a cheaper price. Of the two businesses we've mentioned -- LyondellBasell and AptarGroup -- the latter is the superior business, the former the superior investment. If I were forced to choose one over the other, my choice would have to be LyondellBasell. Quality of business is important enough to trump price on many an occasion, but in this instance, my feeling is that Aptar's superiority as a business isn't enough to wash away its price tag. And LyondellBasell, despite its near-term troubles, is still in a sound business -- one that's here to stay. After all, what can replace plastic? What else can you shape and mold in such variety, with such ease, and at such a price? ","

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

591,John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump,0.8895

""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs.""

Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names.

The market is pricing in a nearly 100% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will lift key interest rates, which leaves much attention on clues for future policy decisions.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable?

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

It was established in 1897 and is a global group of energy companies that sold 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Much of Shell’s revenues come directly from its motorists' division, which sells fuel, engine oil, lubricants and credit cards. Shell offers credit card options to seven different countries around the world. In the United States, Shell offers its customers three options for payments: the Shell Drive for Five, Platinum Select MasterCard, and the Shell Saver card. The Shell Drive for Five Card is a credit card that can only be used to purchase items at a Shell gas station or convenience store. The Platinum Select MasterCard can be used for credit purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted. The Saver card works like a debit card, where users can link a checking account to pay for their gas purchases. Shell has an online website that will provide all three applications. All require applicants to put in their personal information such as name, address and contact phone number. The Saver card requires the applicant’s driver’s license information as well as two security codes in the event of a lost password. From there, a checking account number must be provided to link to the card. The two credit cards require the most information, such as date of birth, Social Security number, and annual salary amount. Both will run a credit check on the applicant, and approval is based on the applicant's credit history. Each of Shell’s payment cards has its own set of reward or benefit programs. The Drive for Five card saves 5 cents for every gallon of Shell fuel purchased. Customers with the Platinum Select MasterCard who spend at least $500 during a billing cycle can get 10 cents per gallon credit the following business cycle. Those who spend $1,000 to $2,499.99 will get 15 cents per gallon credit, and anything more than $2,499.99 will get 20 cents per gallon credit. The Saver card offers its users a savings of 2 cents on each gallon of gas purchased. Any of the three cards would be suggested for customers who frequently purchase gas from Shell stations. Both the Drive for Five and Saver cards can only be used at Shell stations, so the more Shell gas that is pumped, the more benefits accrue. The Platinum MasterCard would be good for anyone who frequently uses credit cards to make purchases and would like reduced gasoline prices. In order to be eligible for a credit on gas prices, you must make $500 or more in purchases using the card. Those who use car travel regularly are excellent examples of who would benefit from a Shell payment card. Companies that employ a traveling sales force would also benefit with a Shell rewards card program. Energy company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) offers an alternative to the Shell program. Exxon offers a Smart card that lets customers earn 12 cents off every gallon for the first two months, then 6 cents off every gallon thereafter. Further, there are several other credit cards that offer reward points which can be an alternative to using a Shell payment card. Many credit cards offer better rewards when used at gas stations. For example, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card lets its users earn 3% on gas purchases of at least $10 up to $2,500 per month. Similarly, the Chase Freedom credit card offers up to 5% cash back on gas station purchases every three months. The Drive for Five credit card has an APR of 25.24% on purchases and an APR of 29.99% on cash advances. The Platinum Select MasterCard has an APR of 24.24% on purchases and an APR of 28.24% on cash advances. Both cards have the same penalty fees for late or return payments of up to $37.

601,Eric Chemi,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"What do companies like General Dynamics, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil have in common? They're a few of the names with board members joining the next presidential Cabinet, if Donald Trump gets his way. Directors from those companies and others — including Wells Fargo, News Corp. and Ingersoll-Rand — are going to be nominated for high-level government positions in the new administration. And those stocks have already seen a benefit to their share prices since the election, beating the overall market. Future government officials such as James Mattis, Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson and Elaine Chao all serve on at least one board of a major publicly traded company. Here's a list, compiled by CNBC and corporate data firm Equilar: We can go one step further and put all these companies into their own basket of stocks. Let's call it the ""Trump Cabinet index"" — and that index has outperformed the overall market since the election. Since Nov. 8, this basket was up 14 percent through Friday, surpassing the S&P 500's move of 6 percent. Specifically, 10 of 15 companies are beating the market. To be clear, none of these people actually serve in the government yet, since almost all of them will require Senate confirmation. And that's not a slam dunk: There's already been plenty of public discussion from current senators about whether Exxon Mobil CEO Tillerson is an appropriate choice to be secretary of State, especially because of his connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But for now the index is worth following. We'll be updating the index as time goes on depending on who is in and out of the government, and which companies they have direct relationships with. It will be interesting to watch whether these companies get an added benefit for having one of their own in government, or whether they sell off harder than normal when the difficulties of managing the nation become a daily reality. Some notes about the index: We did not include WWE because Linda McMahon is no longer on its board of directors, having left to run for senate several years ago. But we did include Goldman Sachs, because Cohn is on that board. Even though Cohn's future nomination as director of the National Economic Council doesn't require Senate confirmation since it's not a Cabinet position, we thought it was a relevant and powerful enough job to include in the basket. We also included Steve Mnuchin's connection to Sears, which he gave up in early December specifically to join the incoming team. ",'Trump Cabinet index' is outpacing the market since election,0.9411
602,Jacob Pramuk,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"In one of his final pitches to voters last month, Donald Trump eviscerated what he called a ""corrupt machine"" of entrenched political leaders, corporations and donors that he said damaged the American working class. The video tied his opponent Hillary Clinton to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and a major Democratic donor, billionaire financier George Soros. ""For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind,"" Trump said in the Nov. 6 video. Since his election, though, Trump has stocked his administration with Blankfein's right-hand man at Goldman and two other alumni of the influential firm, one of whom worked for Soros. Several Trump Cabinet picks donated to his election effort, while his secretary of State choice led a mammoth American company with a global reach. Past presidents have put Wall Street figures and personal donors in their administrations, as well. But after a populist message of shifting power to the forgotten helped to fuel his improbable political rise, Trump seems entirely comfortable filling his administration with the wealthy and influential, money in politics experts said. ""You're playing with fire if you ride a wave of anger against the establishment and big-money politics and then practice big-money politics,"" said Daniel Weiner, senior counsel at the New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice. After Trump entered the presidential race last year, he said his wealth ensured that he did not need donors. He largely funded his own primary run before shifting to more traditional fundraising in the general election. Trump slammed former GOP opponent Sen. Ted Cruz and then Clinton for their ties to Goldman, using his populist pitch to try to win over disillusioned voters on the left who supported Wall Street critic Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the final election push, Trump pledged to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of big-money influence. Trump's transition team announced last month that it would not include lobbyists and said that members of the administration would be banned from lobbying for five years after they left the government, an effort to curb special interests in politics. Beyond the push against lobbying, though, Trump has signaled little desire to reduce the role of the wealthy and powerful, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""His focus on lobbyists means he's concerned about it, but he's defining it very narrowly. Insiders will arguably have more power in the next administration given the kind of powerful perch that they're being appointed to,"" she said. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request to comment on this story. Trump has picked two chief executives of major U.S. companies, a former Goldman partner and a billionaire investor for his Cabinet. He has also chosen Goldman's former second-ranking executive, Gary Cohn, and Linda McMahon, a former WWE CEO who gave $6 million to a super PAC backing him, for non-Cabinet level spots. Cohn will head the National Economic Council, while McMahon was picked for the Small Business Administration. Current Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker donated to President Barack Obama, while George W. Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was the CEO of Goldman, so Trump isn't the first president to pick Wall Street veterans and donors for top spots. But Krumholz said Trump has chosen more wealthy people for his administration than presidents typically have in the past. Trump has defended his picks from the business world by saying they know how to create jobs and will help him follow through on his economic promises. Here is a list of Trump's Cabinet-level picks so far. It includes what they gave to him and outside groups backing him, according to Federal Election Commission records. Still, it remains to be seen how much the senators confirming Trump's picks and the voters who propelled him to the White House care about the wealth in his administration. While Democrats have signaled they could make confirmation difficult for some of the picks, particularly Tillerson, Mnuchin and Sessions, the Republican Senate majority will likely push them through barring a major upheaval within the party. Voters may not be concerned about the influential people in Trump's administration as long as he follows through on campaign promises to boost economic growth and promote job creation in the Rust Belt, said Steven Billet, director of the master's program in legislative affairs at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. Trump has promised that his tax reform and trade policies will boost American businesses and he has already celebrated a deal with United Technologies for it to keep some of the Carrier jobs it planned to move to Mexico. ""If he doesn't deliver the kind of jobs that are appealing to that slice of the American public that was so stridently supportive of his candidacy, then he's going to have a problem,"" Billet said. The Trump transition has recently faced influence issues outside of the appointments. On Tuesday, the transition team denied that Trump's two grown sons had ""any involvement"" with a reported charity event that sought donations of up to $1 million in exchange for packages that included a private reception with the president-elect. Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric serve on his transition team and the president-elect has said they will help to run his businesses after he takes office. A charitable auction for a meeting with Trump's daughter Ivanka was also recently canceled after questions were raised about the ethics of offering access. The proceeds were supposed to go to the St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. Separately, early Trump supporter and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has started a consulting firm based only a block away from the White House to promote Trump's agenda.

603,Elizabeth Gurdus,12222016,CNBC,12152016,"The U.S. has a pressing need to bolster its weak cybersecurity in the face of huge breaches like Russia's suspected sabotage of the election system and Yahoo's billion-user hack, Ret. Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

Although the media has focused on Dodd-Frank and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare) as the biggest regulatory rules enacted under President Barack Obama's administration, perhaps the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has been the most aggressive agency in terms of its regulatory relationship with the industry it oversees. Before Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC was known as a textbook case of regulatory capture with a virtual revolving door of lobbyists and industry titans filling its ranks. Wheeler was considered no different: As the former head of both the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NTCA) and Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, it was widely expected that Wheeler would continue to represent industry interests and apply light-touch regulation. Image source: Getty Images. Instead, Wheeler's FCC has been extremely pro-consumer, to the consternation of the industry. The news that Wheeler is now departing his position could mean a reversal of his pro-consumer legacy and, most notably, his signature net neutrality ruling. In 2015, Wheeler's FCC cemented its pro-consumer legacy. By classifying Internet-service providers (ISPs) as ""common carriers,"" the legislative rule-making body essentially guaranteed net neutrality by ensuring ISPs act as a neutral gateway to the Internet and banning ISPs from speeding up or slowing down legal content passing through their networks. While consumer advocates, digital publishers, and streaming video providers like Netflix were elated with the decision, network providers like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Comcast were enraged with the FCC's Title II designation. Quickly after the ruling, the NTCA (yes, the same organization once led by Chairman Wheeler) and the American Cable Association quickly moved to sue the FCC. AT&T filed a separate lawsuit quickly thereafter. In June, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the FCC and upheld their common carrier status. However, as is customary when a new party wins an election, Wheeler has agreed to step down as FCC chairman on Jan. 20, when Donald Trump is inaugurated. The newly appointed FCC head will most likely be a net-neutrality foe and, along with the new republican FCC majority, will quickly chip away at earlier pro-net neutrality rulings. Net neutrality has become a partisan lawmaker issue, with Democrats in near-unanimous support with Republicans referring to the ruling as ""Obamacare of the Internet."" Recode succinctly described Wheeler's departure as the ""death knell"" for net neutrality. The obvious winners of a repeal of net neutrality would be the ISPs themselves. The ability to charge sites more for using their network is another monetization method to boost top-line results. However, ISPs could still benefit from net neutrality's demise without charging websites for faster delivery. For example, Verizon could be well positioned since it has doubled down on a digital-strategy by purchasing AOL (and its host of digital properties like Engadget, The Huffington Post, and TechCrunch ) and is in the process of buying Yahoo!. Delivering these websites faster while slowing down others should boost the company's bottom line by making these sites more attractive to users...and by extension, marketers. To be fair, some consumers could be beneficiaries of net neutrality laws as well. As wireless service has become a quite-competitive space, carriers have resorted to creative ways to differentiate themselves and to promote higher-margin products. For example, AT&T has announced that streaming on its DirecTV Now products does not count against wireless data cap limits. Verizon offers the same deal for its NFL Mobile and Go90 streaming-video app. The FCC had argued these data-free cutouts, also known as zero-metering, were violations of net neutrality since they amounted to unfair treatment of competing services. Consumers may ultimately receive cheaper internet, but at the expense of a more-limited user experience dictated by consumer interest. One thing is for sure: ISPs are elated about Wheeler's pending departure -- whether consumers should be is decidedly less clear. ","

Although the media has focused on Dodd-Frank and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare) as the biggest regulatory rules enacted under President Barack Obama's administration, perhaps the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has been the most aggressive agency in terms of its regulatory relationship with the industry it oversees. Before Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC was known as a textbook case of regulatory capture with a virtual revolving door of lobbyists and industry titans filling its ranks. Wheeler was considered no different: As the former head of both the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NTCA) and Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, it was widely expected that Wheeler would continue to represent industry interests and apply light-touch regulation. Image source: Getty Images. Instead, Wheeler's FCC has been extremely pro-consumer, to the consternation of the industry. The news that Wheeler is now departing his position could mean a reversal of his pro-consumer legacy and, most notably, his signature net neutrality ruling. In 2015, Wheeler's FCC cemented its pro-consumer legacy. By classifying Internet-service providers (ISPs) as ""common carriers,"" the legislative rule-making body essentially guaranteed net neutrality by ensuring ISPs act as a neutral gateway to the Internet and banning ISPs from speeding up or slowing down legal content passing through their networks. While consumer advocates, digital publishers, and streaming video providers like Netflix were elated with the decision, network providers like Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T), and Comcast were enraged with the FCC's Title II designation. Quickly after the ruling, the NTCA (yes, the same organization once led by Chairman Wheeler) and the American Cable Association quickly moved to sue the FCC. AT&T filed a separate lawsuit quickly thereafter. In June, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the FCC and upheld their common carrier status. However, as is customary when a new party wins an election, Wheeler has agreed to step down as FCC chairman on Jan. 20, when Donald Trump is inaugurated. The newly appointed FCC head will most likely be a net-neutrality foe and, along with the new republican FCC majority, will quickly chip away at earlier pro-net neutrality rulings. Net neutrality has become a partisan lawmaker issue, with Democrats in near-unanimous support with Republicans referring to the ruling as ""Obamacare of the Internet."" Recode succinctly described Wheeler's departure as the ""death knell"" for net neutrality. The obvious winners of a repeal of net neutrality would be the ISPs themselves. The ability to charge sites more for using their network is another monetization method to boost top-line results. However, ISPs could still benefit from net neutrality's demise without charging websites for faster delivery. For example, Verizon could be well positioned since it has doubled down on a digital-strategy by purchasing AOL (and its host of digital properties like Engadget, The Huffington Post, and TechCrunch ) and is in the process of buying Yahoo!. Delivering these websites faster while slowing down others should boost the company's bottom line by making these sites more attractive to users...and by extension, marketers. To be fair, some consumers could be beneficiaries of net neutrality laws as well. As wireless service has become a quite-competitive space, carriers have resorted to creative ways to differentiate themselves and to promote higher-margin products. For example, AT&T has announced that streaming on its DirecTV Now products does not count against wireless data cap limits. Verizon offers the same deal for its NFL Mobile and Go90 streaming-video app. The FCC had argued these data-free cutouts, also known as zero-metering, were violations of net neutrality since they amounted to unfair treatment of competing services. Consumers may ultimately receive cheaper internet, but at the expense of a more-limited user experience dictated by consumer interest. One thing is for sure: ISPs are elated about Wheeler's pending departure -- whether consumers should be is decidedly less clear. ","

606,Michael Brush,12222016,MarketWatch,12152016,"Published: Dec 16, 2016 8:46 a.m. ET Those with high deferred tax liabilities will be the real winners By Many investors are now hunting for companies that pay high U.S. taxes because they stand to benefit the most if Donald Trump cuts corporate taxes, as he said he would. But the real accounting sleuths are looking elsewhere for the hidden gems that may get the biggest boost. They’re digging up the companies that have the largest “deferred tax liabilities” on the books. If you want to skip the details on the moving parts and just get to examples of the biggest beneficiaries, then go to the “ big potential winners” section below. Otherwise, here’s a little background on what’s at work. (Also read: How S&P 500 companies would save $87.1 billion if Trump passes his tax plan.) You can think of a deferred tax liability as a store of value on the balance sheet that gets released on to the income statement over time for accounting purposes. Companies use this account to make up for differences in how they keep their two sets of books — one for the tax collector and the other for investors. Companies typically expense certain costs — the price of big-ticket items like equipment and plants, for example — more quickly for the IRS than they can in the books prepared for investors. This lowers their taxes in the near term. But then they go up in later years, all things being equal. To make up for the timing differences, companies set aside deferred tax liabilities. Here’s where things get interesting for investors. Companies calculate the amount to set aside using the prevailing tax rate, currently 35%. But if Trump and Republicans in Congress reduce the tax rate, companies will suddenly have to set aside far less money for deferred tax liabilities, providing an immediate boost to earnings. Suppose the tax rate gets cut to 20%, a likely compromise scenario in Washington. (Trump wants 15%, but many Congressional leaders don’t want to go quite that far.) This would mean a company’s new deferred tax liability would be 57% (or 20%/35%) of the old one. Deferred tax liabilities would decline by 43%, in other words. That money would go straight to the income statement as “earnings” and, theoretically at least, boost the value of a company’s market value. “It’s a gift from the government. It’s like debt forgiveness,” says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock picks are up an annualized 7.9% since April 2006 versus 5% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index. “If they lower the tax rate, the deferred tax liability has to be restated, and that provides a onetime credit in the income statement.” True, this is a “non cash” event. There is no money that magically appears out of nowhere. But it will affect reported earnings and thus influence investor sentiment on a stock. The big potential winners To find some of the biggest potential winners, I asked S&P Global Market Intelligence to screen for the companies with the largest deferred tax liabilities. The two companies with the biggest are Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

                                   at $31.7 billion. Those companies could see their market values rise 7% to 10% from the effect of the tax reduction. To see why, let’s walk through an example, with AT&T. If the tax rate drops to 20%, AT&T’s deferred tax liability would decline to $34 billion from $59.6 billion, a reduction of $25.5 billion. Hence, there would be a $25.5 billion credit adjustment in the income statement, effectively boosting earnings by $25.5 billion in the year of the restatement, says Meyer. Since the company has a $245 billion market value, that $25.5 billion gain theoretically represents a 10.45% increase in market value, he says. That is just an estimate, not a hard-and-fast rule. But it’s a good gauge of the potential impact the change may have on how investors think about valuing the company. Now, consider Pfizer. The tax cut reduction to 20% would take down its deferred tax liability of $31.7 billion to $18.1 billion, for a “savings” of $13.6 billion. That could represent a 7% increase in its $186 billion market value. Utilities While the six companies above have the biggest absolute deferred tax liabilities, the biggest potential impact to stock prices may lie elsewhere — among the companies that have the largest liabilities relative to their market values. Since utilities spend a lot on plants and equipment, they have some of the biggest depreciation expenses for tax purposes. So they have some of the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value. Utilities also happen to be out of favor among investors right now, which makes them an interesting contrarian play. Investors are fleeing bond-like stocks that pay high dividends, such as utilities, on fears that Federal Reserve interest-rate increases will be bad for those stocks. The theory is that the shares of bond-like stocks (and bond prices) can fall as interest rates go up, since the price moves “adjust up” their yields to match yields set higher in the markets because of Fed rate hikes. This widespread aversion to utilities is one reason Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report likes utilities as a contrarian buy right now. An added plus for utilities is that they typically have big deferred tax liabilities. Thus, they stand to gain a lot if Washington cuts the corporate tax rate. According to my calculations using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, the six utilities with the biggest deferred tax liabilities relative to market value are: Entergy

607,Michael K. Farr,12292016,CNBC,12222016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary,0.9998
608,Ryan Vlastelica,12292016,MarketWatch,12222016,"Published: Dec 27, 2016 8:15 a.m. ET Many questions remain about Trump’s policies and geopolitical aims By In an increasingly tense world, why is Wall Street looking so sanguine? From a geopolitical perspective, 2016 has been the most volatile year in recent history, with historic elections in Britain, Italy, and the U.S. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president has ratcheted up anxieties, with the real-estate mogul recently saying that he planned to “greatly strengthen and expand” the country’s nuclear capability, raising the specter of a Cold War-era style arms race. However, observers may be hard pressed to discern any signs of the swiftly shifting political landscape in the equity markets. After a rocky start, trading this year was marked by a rally that has taken major indexes to repeated records, but despite the tilt higher Wall Street has mostly been marked by a historic level of quiescence.

                                   a measure of investor anxiety, recently fell to its lowest level since August 2015. According to LPL Financial, the average level for the “fear index” in 2016 was below 16, the fifth straight year it has averaged below 20, the level considered its long-term average. Readings below 12 suggests that the market isn’t betting on any sharp market swings. Despite that, investors are nearly unanimous that the events of the year have injected huge amounts of uncertainty into the economy. It is unknown what the fallout will be to the U.K.’s vote to exit from out of the European Union, known as Brexit, or the populist movements sweeping Europe. President-elect Donald Trump remains a wild card, as his tweets hint at potentially massive changes to U.S. policy on China, in addition to calling out companies and Wall Street executives. “The world economy and markets have embarked on a journey into the unknown,” researchers at Pimco wrote in a Dec. 15 note. The firm didn’t adjust its outlook for 2017, but wrote that “our confidence in any particular scenario is low. The reason: the world has now fully arrived in the radically uncertain, ‘stable but not secure’ predicament.” The most commonly invoked aphorism on Wall Street is “markets hate uncertainty.” So why hasn’t “a journey into the unknown” devolved into wild price swings? Some analysts believe that we might get that at some point—but not yet. Read:  Delayed reaction? Here’s when the latest terror attacks could rattle markets See also: How Trump and Brexit are shaking up investment portfolios for 2017 Perhaps the biggest question mark among geopolitical issue involves Russia. On Monday, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by a Turkish police officer, raising tensions that had already been elevated due to the country’s alleged hacking during the U.S. campaign; Moscow has been charged with stealing and leaking emails in an effort to interfere with the election in favor of Trump. While top Senate Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for investigations into the issue, Trump has dismissed intelligence assessments of the hack, raising questions about the kind of response will be made by the government, if any. “These are really big wild cards. You hear guys like [Sen. Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell saying that no matter what Russia did, they’re not our friend. And then Trump comes out to say he’s a fan of Putin—that’s a huge chasm, and we don’t know what side anyone is on,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners, which manages $89 billion. U.S. intelligence and Homeland security accused Russia of directing a series of cyberattacks to influence the outcome of the presidential election. “If the election was tampered with, then there should be some kind of retaliation, which would fly in the face of both Trump and Tillerson, who is also very friendly with Putin. Those are significant curveballs, and all they do is add more uncertainty to the market,” said Mullaney.

who was recently named Trump’s secretary of state and has had business dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the uncertainty, equities have risen steadily since the election, with investors betting that the broad outlines of Trump’s expected economic policy proposals—which include massive corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and heavy infrastructure spending—will accelerate economic growth and spur inflation. “Markets have factored in the prospect of lower taxes. That’s the numerical rationale for these gains; it’s not just euphoria about a business-oriented president,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “We’re not that goofy, overall,” she said of market analysts. Read: Wall Street’s Trump optimism comes with heavy dose of uncertainty Trump has released few details about the policies he will pursue, making it difficult to evaluate their impact on the economy or corporate growth. Thus far, however, corporate optimism doesn’t seem to match the expectations conveyed by Wall Street’s rapid rise. Nick Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group, recently noted that 2017 revenue growth estimates for Dow components had fallen to 4.5% from the 4.8% that had been forecast before the election. “If history is any guide, they will be trimming it further,” he wrote of company analysts in a newsletter. “Moreover, our first look at 2018 revenue [comparisons] for the Dow shows analysts expect top line growth to decelerate further, to just 3.7% versus 2017.” Don’t miss: Stocks get Trump bounce, but not the real economy Even if fundamentals don’t show signs of weakening, however, the prospect of elevated tension with military rivals like Russia, or with major trading partners like China or Mexico—both of which Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on—could be enough to bring markets down. “If you look at headlines about our relationship with China getting choppy, or the degree to which we may become buddies with Russia, or about how Europe manages itself in this political age, then it’s easy to see why we expect volatility will come back into this market,” said Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim. “The current lack of concern seems to be that the dust will settle in a way that’s not too dissimilar from what we have now, but even if that’s true, the path to the dust settling is uncertain.” Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

609,,1052017,Reuters,12292016,"(This January 3 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company) By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices. Trump’s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector. And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits. But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers. But the industry’s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say. “I don’t see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,” said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm. The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income. Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade. “We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,” Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement. Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and “listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out.” Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar’s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict. “This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank. “Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They’ll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I’m unsympathetic,” he added. Height Securities’ Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: “Trump doesn’t want to have refineries closing on his watch.” Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose. For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans’ plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump’s plan, to 15 percent. Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments. Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate. ","

As you would expect, the biggest recipients are defense contractors, which already had good reason to watch Trump closely after he was involved in a deal to keep Carrier jobs in Indiana. Companies like Lockheed Martin may top the list at $36 billion in contractual obligations, but companies across several other industries are getting a huge amount of their revenue from the government, according to data from the federal system and FactSet. For the energy sector, Exxon Mobil is the biggest contractor with almost $800 million in petroleum contracts, mostly for the Defense Logistics Agency. That may seem like a lot, but it's a negligible fraction of the energy giant's revenue each year. The same is true for the telecom leader, AT&T, and shipping leader FedEx, which each made a little over $600 million from the government in 2015. The situation is completely different for the leading firm in information technology, SAIC, which depends on government contracts for 78 percent of its revenue. Private prisons firm GEO Group lead the real estate sector, making about 71 percent of its $1.8 billion in sales from government contracts. In health care, McKesson Corp. made over $8 billion, most of which came from its lucrative relationship with Veteran's Affairs. That's about 4 percent of the pharmaceutical distributor's revenue. For companies classified as financial firms, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest government contractor. But the company didn't earn that position through its financial businesses — most of its government revenue came from its nonfinancial holdings, including providing metals to the U.S. Mint, mobile homes for FEMA and flight training for the FAA, according to government data. Not counting state or local spending, the federal government paid almost $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015. Those are big sums, and those companies are going to be noticing everything Trump says. ",Top government contractors: 52 public companies that make the most,0.9771
612,Michael K. Farr,1052017,CNBC,12292016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary,0.9998

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering. The company’s IPO filing included a lengthy disclosure of its risks related to climate-change policies.

614,Abigail Stevenson,1122017,CNBC,1052017,"While the market continues to focus on whether the Dow Jones industrial average will hit 20,000, Jim Cramer would rather look at how conceivable it is for the Dow to keep running after it does. Good news is that he does think it is possible. ""When you look at how far stocks would need to rally to get back to their all-time highs, you will find that many of these Dow names have been much higher in less fortuitous circumstances,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer boiled it down to 12 encouraging stocks that must advance more than 10 percent to get back to their old highs. No. 1 is Wal-Mart, which would need to climb 32 percent to get back to where it was two years ago. With the strength of Amazon, Cramer recognized that this is a lot to ask and said he doesn't expect it to help the Dow get to 20,000. No. 2 is American Express. The stock has 28 percent to run back to its 2014, and Cramer recommended buying it at current levels. All it would take is a multiple expansion now that the multiple is in favor. No. 3 was IBM, which would have to mount a 26 percent gain to get back to its $216 high in 2013. Unfortunately, Cramer didn't think IBM will get back to a 15 price-to-earnings multiple up from its current 12. ""In truth, IBM should never have been as high as $216. Its earnings were inflated by buybacks and the price was hyped by hoopla surrounding Warren Buffett's anointment of the stock,"" Cramer said. No. 4 was Nike, the most intriguing stock to Cramer. Nike would need its stock to advance 26 percent to reach old highs, and Cramer thinks if Donald Trump can lower the corporate tax rate, it could help move it higher. However, he wasn't confident that it can close the gap between $53 and $67. No. 5 was Caterpillar, which also told investors it's not doing that well. It also would be the most hurt if Trump starts to play hardball with China, but it would also be a large beneficiary to a domestic infrastructure program. Cramer was willing to bet that the stock can creep towards its old level on positive commodity data and cost cuts from Trump. No. 6 and 7 were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which need to add 17 percent to get back to their old highs, and Cramer won't count on them to get the Dow to 20,000. ""Frankly, that is just asking too much of these stocks,"" Cramer said. No. 8 was Coca-Cola, and with a new CEO coming in, Cramer was willing to bet that the restructuring designed by outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent means the company will meet its numbers. However, he says the stock cannot be relied on to rally 14 percent to its former glory. No. 9 was Apple, and Cramer thinks the stock is looking like it will break out soon. It must advance a little more than 13 percent, and Cramer is concerned that Apple hasn't augmented its service revenue stream and isn't using its massive cash hoard to make more acquisitions. No. 10 was Cisco, which is still reeling from a downbeat quarter. Cramer wants Cisco to find a way to make it clear that its legacy business isn't hurting it as it transitions to more of a cloud play. He wasn't confident that the stock can rally 13 percent to its recent high. No. 11 and 12 was Disney and United Technologies, which need to rally 12 and 10 percent respectively to get to all-time highs. Based on Disney's theme park attendance, movies and potential to be a beneficiary of a corporate tax cut, Cramer called this one an ""up"" stock United Technologies will have a tough time gaining traction because of its recent strong run. If anything, Cramer expects the numbers to come down. So, while Cramer only found a few stocks among the list that could get back to old highs, many of them reached such high levels in a worse environment. Perhaps they can do it again.

615,Fred Imbert,1122017,CNBC,1052017,"U.S. equities closed higher in choppy trade on Wednesday, shrugging off a sharp decline in health care stocks following remarks made by President-elect Donald Trump. ""We have to get our drug industry coming back. Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right,"" Trump said at his first news conference since winning the U.S. election. The Nasdaq composite fell after Trump made his remarks, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3 percent. The tech-heavy index, however, ended the session 0.2 percent higher at a record closing level. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent, shrugging off a 1 percent decline in health care. Energy stocks led the way in the S&P, rising 1.2 percent. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said the stock market has largely given Trump  the benefit of the doubt. He said that would change after the inauguration. ""After that point, his actions will become more important versus what he says,"" he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 99 points higher, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index briefly turned lower after Trump's remarks on the pharmaceutical industry. Investors came into the news conference looking for clues about his proposed policies. Stocks in the U.S. have rallied sharply since Trump's victory, amid hope that the incoming administration will cut corporate taxes, deregulate certain sectors and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Trump's news conference concluded without him providing details on these policies. ""We need some concrete numbers. We haven't sold off because there hasn't been a reason to do so. That said, you're dealing with some pretty nervous longs here,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Our hope is that these three policies will be enacted and a more pragmatic approach will be taken to trade and immigration,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. He also said he expects Trump to wait until the after the inauguration to provide more guidance on his policies. That said, some of the president-elect's tweets have raised concerns among investors. Since Nov. 8, Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize companies that planned to send jobs overseas rather than create them in the United States. He has also threatened to levy a high border tax against those firms. ""What's interesting about Trump is he's sort of managed to work around the traditional news cycle,"" said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. ""The market is also grappling with that, too."" ""Companies like Airbus and Boeing will not only have to think about their input cost, but they will also have to pay attention to (the) PR perspective,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Separately, Trump's nominee for secretary of State Rex Tillerson, testified on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearing. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has raised concerns among most of the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Marco Rubio, given his lack of public service experience and close ties to Russia. ""There's so much that could come out from those hearings,"" said Hartford Funds' Siomades. ""This cast of characters is not well known, and the market could react to that."" Wall Street also braced itself for the start of earnings season, as banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among others, are slated to report quarterly results on Friday. ""I think we're going to get a good earnings season,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. ""The question is can the market sustain the euphoria with what could still be considered relatively modest earnings growth."" In the bond market, meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys traded higher after Trump's news conference, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.365 percent and the two-year note yield holding near 1.18 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after trading higher, with the euro near $1.057 and the yen around 115.38. The pound briefly fell around 1 percent against the dollar, breaking below $1.21. Sterling last traded at $1.22. Overseas, European equities traded higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing 0.23 percent. In Asia, Chinese stocks closed lower overnight, with the Shanghai composite  dropping 0.79 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225  recorded a gain of 0.33 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 19,954.28, with Merck leading advancers and Pfizer  lagging. The S&P 500 rose 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at 2,275.32, with energy leading eight sectors higher and health care the top decliner. The Nasdaq composite advanced 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 5,563.65.

The election of Donald Trump has many wondering whether the renewable energy industry will continue to flourish in the United States. Much to FuelCell Energy's (NASDAQ:FCEL) delight, though, there are several signs suggesting that America's neighbors to the north have no intention of slowing down. Though it's uncertain how advantageous this is for FuelCell Energy, it does represent some interesting opportunities -- opportunities that could possibly translate to ever-elusive profits. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. There's certainly been no shortage of talk about pipelines extending from Canada recently. Stealing some of the headlines from the Dakota Access Pipeline, another familiar name -- Keystone XL -- has been reappearing since Donald Trump revealed his support of the pipeline to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Both leaders' apparent enthusiasm for activity in the oil sands bodes well for FuelCell Energy, which recently revealed its participation in related studies. Partnering with Alberta Innovates, FuelCell Energy will conduct an engineering study for a fuel-cell carbon capture application at a heavy oil refinery near Saskatchewan. According to FuelCell Energy's press release, ""A second potential site, the Scotford bitumen upgrading facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, will also be evaluated as part of the engineering study."" Operated by Royal Dutch Shell, the facility is part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project -- site of the first commercial application of carbon capture and storage in the oil sands industry. FuelCell Energy also revealed in its press release that should the study prove that the application is a success, it could lead to ""a megawatt-scale fuel cell carbon application at an existing gas-fired plant."" It's not just the oil sands that represent an opportunity for FuelCell Energy, but coal power as well. The Canadian government recently announced its plan to phase out traditional coal-power plants by 2030. In working toward that goal, the government will work with four provinces to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-power plants. Canada's commitment could benefit FuelCell Energy, as the company began a partnership with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) last spring on developing technology for carbon capture through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. A 2.8 MW DFC3000 fuel-cell power plant. Image source: FuelCell Energy corporate website. Addressing the benefits of this application, Chip Bottone, FuelCell Energy's president and CEO, recognized that, ""Carbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants."" Testing the fuel cell carbon capture technology with its DFC3000 fuel-cell power system at a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal- and gas-fired power plant in Alabama, the company estimates that the DFC3000 fuel-cell power system reduces approximately 70% of a plant's smog-producing pollutants like nitrogen oxides and remove 90% of carbon from the exhaust stream. Between the oil sands and transition from coal power, Canada's opportunities may very well be sources of revenue for FuelCellEnergy in the years to come. Unfortunately, those years are considerably down the line, and the company has much more pressing issues to contend with right now -- so much so that it may never get to realize those opportunities in the Great White North. Updating investors in December, management reported that it was ""reducing materials spend as well as implementing various cost control initiatives"" in order to achieve its long-term goals. The company, for example, reduced its global workforce by 17% as well as implementing other measures in order to reduce its operating expenses by $6 million on an annualized basis. This would translate to an approximate reduction of 14% based on the $42 million that the company reported in fiscal 2015. Further illustrating the company's precarious position, management noted it was forecasting revenue to fall to a range of $107 million to $109 million for fiscal 2016 -- a far cry from the range of $170 million to $210 million that it had forecast on the Q4 conference call in 2015. No longer a contender for the Beacon Falls Energy Park -- worth a potential $500 million between equipment and service over its life, according to management -- FuelCell Energy is relying on the more than $400 million it has in contracted backlog as of Oct. 31, 2016 to keep the lights on. Any opportunities in Canada that inspire hopes of profits must be tempered by the reality that the company is still struggling to prove the advantages of its fuel-cell solutions to customers.

Investors haven't been happy with IBM (NYSE:IBM) lately. Since Ginni Rometty started as CEO in January of 2012, IBM has seen 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year declining revenue -- essentially every quarter of her tenure. The stock has lost nearly 10% compared to a gain of 78% for the S&P 500 over the last five years. IBM 5 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. For IBM shareholders, Ginni Rometty's four-year reign as chief executive officer hasn't been anything to go to Disneyland about. But her company has become a leader in one corporate category: board members willing to shovel incentive pay at a CEO turning in a mediocre performance. With all the negative sentiment and equally dismal stock performance, should investors have any hope that IBM will right the ship? IBM believes it can, and it's betting the future on Watson. You may recall how Ken Jennings, famous for his 74 consecutive wins on Jeopardy, was dethroned by Watson, the IBM supercomputer. Why would a company risk so much on a game-playing computer? The key is not in the computer as much as in the science behind it. IBM's Watson beats 74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings.  Image source: Flickr user edwardhblake. Watson is a system based on artificial intelligence (AI). Computer simulations of the human brain, called neural networks, mimic humans' capacity to learn. Using massive amounts of data and complex algorithms, an AI system gradually learns to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. It is taught to recognize patterns within massive amounts of data. IBM has been betting heavily on Watson by leveraging its AI platform and data analytics for a variety of business applications. The company's CEO has said that, in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of Watson. Several recent high-profile partnerships illustrate how IBM has been approaching this goal, and the strategy appears to be gaining steam. UA Record smartphone app powers Healthbox.     Image source: Under Armour. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) announced a strategic partnership with IBM to leverage the 190 million registered users of its Connected Fitness platform and Watson's deep-learning technology. The system would provide users with individual health and fitness insights backed by data. It is intended to act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer, and assistant. This collaboration underpins the HealthBox, Under Armour's connected fitness system, which combines a fitness band, digital scale, heart-rate monitor, and the UA Record smartphone app. It will track sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, and training information, and provide personalized recommendations. This is a valuable project for IBM since Watson learns with each infusion of data. The partnership is a win for Under Armour as well, and is part of a bigger play. Its acquisition of three fitness app companies that now comprise its Connected Fitness platform, the release of Healthbox, and the integration of Watson provides Under Armour with an end-to-end health and fitness solution that connects to its users in a very real way. This will likely drive future adoption and boost customer satisfaction. OnStar Go powered by Watson. Image source: General Motors Company. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) partnered with IBM to pair its OnStar vehicle-communication system with Watson's learning capabilities to create OnStar Go, a cognitive mobility platform. According to the press release, the new platform's numerous benefits include helping drivers avoid traffic, giving them the ability to order coffee on the go, making restaurant recommendations, and reminding users to pick up diapers and formula on the way home. Drivers will have to consent, and Watson will recognize their preferences and patterns in their decisions and habits. This will also develop individualized and location-based marketing. The partnership will present other business opportunities. OnStar has already signed iHeartRadio, which will provide personalized musical experiences, and MasterCard, which will allow consumers to pay for gas and other services from their car. Other partners include ExxonMobil, Glympse, and Parkopedia. iOS enterprise developers get access to Watson. Image source: IBM. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM's partnership was first announced over two years ago but has evolved in the meantime. Initially, the pair planned the development of over 100 enterprise apps for a variety of industries, including retail, healthcare, banking, transportation, and insurance. According to a recent announcement, enterprise iOS users will have in-app access to Watson, opening the door to deep-learning technology for these made-for-business apps. iOS app developers will be able to use Watson's AI as a platform for their own apps. Apple has already benefited from the partnership by gaining inroads into enterprise. IBM announced last year that it had begun to replace its PCs with Apple Mac computers. Employees were given the option to make the switch and 73% chose Mac. In a presentation at Jamf Nation User Conference, a gathering of Mac system administrators, IBM told attendees that PCs were three times more expensive to manage, Macs had a lower total cost of ownership, and that the Mac was the standard at IBM Japan -- PCs were the exception. These recent developments will provide greater validation to Apple's prospective enterprise customers while advancing the company's AI agenda. Apple has an installed base of over 1 billion active iOS devices with a growing percentage of those in enterprise. This, combined with Watson's ability to learn from streams of data, will provide both companies with a stronger relative position from which to compete. These collaborations are merely the most high-profile examples of hundreds going on behind the scenes. IBM tweeted earlier this year that more than 500 partners and 80,000 developers were building products and apps powered by Watson. The installed base that comes with the partnerships is growing, and should eventually show up in IBM's revenue and provide vindication for the company's Watson-centric strategy. IBM expects Watson to contribute $1 billion in revenue by 2018, and $10 billion by 2023, though it doesn't currently break out that contribution. Strategic Initiatives, where Watson's revenue resides was $8 billion in the most recent quarter, of $19 billion total revenue for IBM. It's a relatively small slice for IBM now, but it's clear the company expects to build AI into a major pillar of its business in the next few years. If it works, it might just reverse fortunes for the flailing big tech company.  ","

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering.

619,Jack Hough,1122017,MarketWatch,1052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

                                   launched in 2011. “But investors are stepping on the gas with valuations high. If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016). Since then, the iShares Russell 1000 Value exchange-traded fund

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

Its managers screen the market to select the cheapest slice based on the relationship between share prices and the value of a company’s assets. They then favor smaller and more-prosperous companies. The approach keeps costs and turnover low for an active fund, but not returns. Over the past 15 years, the fund has beaten the S&P 500 by nearly two percentage points a year.

The fund lagged behind the S&P 500 in both 2014 and 2015 but trounced it last year, and is now ahead by two percentage points a year on average over the past five years. The GoodHaven fund is managed by a pair of alumni from the Fairholme fund, which is known for concentrated positions and spectacular periods of over- and underperformance, mostly the former. This has added up to long-term returns well ahead of the market, but also plenty of discomfort along the way. Launched in 2011, GoodHaven, too, is keeping things interesting. Last year, it beat the S&P 500 by eight percentage points. The year before it trailed by 20.

620,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"The deal, Exxon’s biggest since its 2009 buyout of XTO Energy, is the latest by oil producers across the Permian since last summer, with technological improvements and rangebound oil prices fueling the buyouts. Exxon is exchanging an initial $5.6 billion in stock for leases covering roughly 275,000 acres from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Additional payments of up to $1 billion will start in 2020, depending on how the acreage performs, Exxon said in a statement. Most of the wells to be drilled on the land should provide “attractive returns” with oil prices CLc1 at or above $40 per barrel, Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said. Much of the Permian’s oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more. About 250,000 acres is on three large parcels in the Permian, and the rest is on oil fields in Colorado and Louisiana. The Permian land, which Exxon estimates holds 3.4 billion barrels of oil retrievable with current technology, produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), most of which is crude. Most of the acreage is held by production, meaning Exxon will not have to rush to add new wells to honor lease contracts. Exxon pumps about 140,000 boepd from its current Permian holdings of roughly 1.5 million acres. The company operates 10 drilling rigs in the Permian and said it will boost that to 25 to develop the new acreage, though no timetable has been set. The deal is the first major move by Chief Executive Darren Woods since he took over from Rex Tillerson, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be U.S. secretary of state. Exxon plans to run the acreage through its XTO subsidiary, which operates elsewhere in Texas and North Dakota. Exxon’s shares were up about 0.6 percent in midday trading. ","

621,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

622,,1192017,Reuters,1122017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to overhaul a gasoline producing unit and the hydrocracker at its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery in March, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday. The 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 2 and the 25,000 bpd Hydrocracking Unit 1 will be shut along with other units during the overhaul, the sources said. FCCU 2 is the smaller of two cat crackers at the refinery. The 125,000 bpd FCCU 1 will remain in operation during the work. HCU 1 is the only hydrocracker at the refinery. A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high pressure to produce motor fuels, primarily diesel from gas oil. The Baytown refinery is the second largest in the United States and Exxon’s largest U.S. refinery. ","

623,Tom DiChristopher,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"The world's biggest publicly traded energy company is joining the land rush in the prolific Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil announced Tuesday it will pay $5.6 billion in stock to acquire companies owned by Texas' Bass family that control parts of the Permian in New Mexico. The purchase roughly doubles Exxon's holdings in the basin, adding acreage with an estimated 3.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The assets are located in the Delaware Basin, part of the larger Permian. The deal is the largest oil and gas acquisition in the United States since crude prices crashed in November 2014, according to Houston-based oil and gas research firm PLS. It tops the previous record-setting $4.4 billion purchase of Memorial Resources by Range Resources in May. ""This acquisition strengthens Exxon Mobil's significant presence in the dominant U.S. growth area for onshore oil production,"" Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren W. Woods said in a statement. ""This investment gives us an exceptional Delaware Basin position ... that can generate attractive returns in a low-price environment."" Shares of Exxon were up modestly Tuesday. The Delaware Basin has lately boasted eye-popping land prices. Deals there made up the bulk of last year's $69 billion in U.S. energy mergers and acquisitions. Permian acreage is a prized because the basin's geology allows drillers to produce oil at very low prices and profit from the operations even as a severe crude price downturn extends into a third year. The adjusted per-acre price for Exxon's purchase comes in at about $20,000, ""a very good number for New Mexico,"" said Andrew Dittmar, mergers and acquisitions analyst at PLS. Exxon will pay the Basses, a prominent Forth Worth energy family, up to $1 billion in cash contingent on the land's production. The deal marks the second recent purchase of Delaware Basin assets controlled by a storied energy family. In September, EOG Resources bought Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion. The Yates family's history in American oil stretches back about a century. EOG paid about $9,000 per acre in that deal, which was also centered on New Mexico's Lea and Eddy counties, PLS data shows. Exxon's deal also comes just one day after Noble Energy paid $3.2 billion, including debt, to buy Clayton Williams Energy. That acquisition focused on assets in the southern Delaware Basin in Texas, at a price of $33,000 per acre, according to PLS.

""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals.

625, ,1192017,CNBC,1122017,"Following are excerpts from a CNBC interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, from the World Economic Forum 2017 with Steve Sedgwick SS: Patrick great to see you again. Look the world is seemingly a different place 12 months on, the oil price has pretty much doubled. Does that make your job a lot easier? PP: For sure it is easier at 55 dollar then 28 dollar.  . I don't know if the word is easier. I begin to believe that the oil price is maybe a leading indicator of the mood of the world. But you know when you compare the situation one year ago, price collapse to 28 dollar a barrel, and the atmosphere in Davos was not very optimistic. This year is 55 but I remind you two years ago it was 100. So still some gap to do. People are more positive. And at the same time the status of the world did not improve a lot you know, in the one year many events in the Middle East, Brexit, many difficulties appear around the world so, but people are more positive. SS: Well that's interesting because we've seen the markets recover, we've seen the oil price recover and yet we've seen a whole host of quite damning political events for many in 2016 as well. But you think despite those political events the world is actually a more positive place and perhaps a safer place? PP: Safer, no. Not safer. There are many uncertainties. I would say what characterize the world for me today is a lot of uncertainty which is not good for business. There is an economist who was saying at the beginning of the century you have a difference between risks and uncertainty, risk you can manage, you can quantify risks. Uncertainty you don't know. And today what I face is many uncertainty- we are waiting to see what the foreign policy of Donald Trump will be, clearly Brexit and there is huge uncertainty over the future of Europe and how you deal with such a country outside of the European union, plus of course in the Middle East Iran is back because of the agreement last year- it involved many difficulties around. So there is much uncertainty. SS: All right, well you've mentioned three very important areas as well- Mr. Trump, Iran and Europe's cohesion. Let's start off with Mr. Trump as well. How's it going to be for you, do you think actually he's going to change the way that oil companies are going to do business in the US and elsewhere, do you think there's going to be any meteoric changes at all? PP:I think clearly, on energy, there are plenty of specialist of energy in this government, he has strong feeling that energy is one of the advantage of the U.S. economy already today in fact. So he's willing to not put too much regulations in order to help the investment in energy so it's good for energy companies, at least for oil and gas companies, so it's positive I think from these companies' point of view. We'll see then what he will do exactly- because you know there is a difference between what you say and when you are in power. We will see. SS: You say oil and gas companies, the oil companies are becoming more and more gas and oil companies and so the push to cleaner hydrocarbons, to renewables as well, the big investments that you at Total have been in making in green energy, in solar, in storage as well. Do you think a lot of that is actually going to be more difficult to carry on with large levels of investment because of Mr. Trump? PP: Not for gas, you know gas is one the big advantage of the U.S. economy, the shale gas revolution is at the heart of this rejuvenation of the US manufacturing industry, it is energy which is at the core of the capacity of the US to grow their manufacturing industry, to develop jobs. By the way we have invested in gas in the US this year, we have extended our position in Texas, in the Barnett. We just announced a deal with a (company name not clear) a gas company that wants to export energy. So for me US gas is working well. Renewables, we are also shown some progress- I suspect maybe the fiscal incentives which have been planned for renewables maybe will diminish but we will see. SS: That's quite damning in what is arguably the world's largest consumer of energy. PP: Yeah but OK in the meantime renewables have made progress so again it's a matter- I think there will be some debate between the congress, the President so we will see what the outcome will be of all that. But I'm positive, I think the U.S. economy is already strong. So I don't know if Mr. Trump will be able to do it stronger but it seems that it is his vision but we will see what he is doing exactly. SS: It's  no secret that Exxon Mobil and Total, and Total backed by a lot of other companies have a difference of opinion of a way to approach climate change and approach sustainability and what the remedy might be for oil and gas companies. How do you think Rex Tillerson might be as Secretary of State and what does it mean do you think for relations with other players including Russia? PP: There are many questions there. Climate change, Russia you know. I think first, I think the testimony from Rex Tillerson was quite clear- he believes in climate change, then there is the question of what is the strategy of Exxon now that he is no longer in charge. The difference was more between Exxon and Total: Should we involve the company in this green energy business to prepare for the future, that is a strategy decision, we believe that it is a matter of market, not just climate change, if we want to find new growth we can continue in oil and gas but at a certain point demand could peak so we prefer to prepare for the future and invest some of our money in renewable energy storage. Having said that, in twenty years we still remain an oil and gas company. But having also a foot in renewables. SS: And the second point, Mr. Tillerson knows Russia very well, you know Russia very well. There seems to be from Mr. Trump language of a rapprochement with Mr. Putin as well. Do you think it can benefit Total and the whole oil and gas industry? PP: It's not only the oil and gas industry, it's more a matter of world stability. Clearly Russia is a big player, by the way each time you have a new U.S. President- George W. Bush, Barack Obama, now Mr. Trump, first year they all began to engage in a positive dialogue with Russia. We will see if it happens. I hope so, because frankly we cannot have a [inaudible] it's important for Europe too to find a way to stabilize all of that. It's not so easy because the U.S. also like to have a big problem [inaudible]  in front of them. But of course I am an investor in Russia so if it is more stable it is better for me but I think also it is better for the world. SS: if the US is looking for closer relations with Russia. There is concern that it actually doesn't want to continue closer relations with Iran as well. You've made investments looking at developing South Pars as well. Do you fear for those investments? I spoke to one of your peers a while back who said he was concerned about investing in Iran precisely because of what sanctions could come from the U.S. PP: Let's be clear about Iran. There is a sanctions system existing in the U.S. we have to obey to that. There is no way for Total, or any other company, to escape from that. Having said that, and I've been very transparent with the Obama administration about all the moves- we made them aware of what we were doing, we respect what we have singed, we respect the agreements, if the sanctions framework is changing we will have to adapt ourselves. So I will just observe what will be done by the Trump administration about Iran. But you know it is a world where you cannot have many enemies- China, Russia, Iran you have to select things. So we will work and again it is an opportunity for us- you know for Total if you are an oil and gas company you have to go to where there is oil and gas- there is oil and gas in Russia, there is oil and gas in Iran. Having said that I'm perfectly aware there are some risks, it is a matter then of what is the size of the risk compared to the size of the company, and investing 1 or 2 billion in Iran when we have 150bn USD of assets is not a big risk and it could be a big reward for our shareholders. SS: Where is the biggest risk for Total in 2017? PP: The biggest risk? Again, for me it is more the uncertainty internationally, it's very difficult today to tell you what will happen and I suspect it will take some months.   Because I suspect that it's not only if President Trump came to office next Friday, you still have the full administration to put in place before we understand the full policies so it will take time. We are entering into 6 months, 9 months of uncertainty and it's not good for business because what business wants is predictability you know, if you are to invest, if you want to take decisions in energy you invest for 20 years, you need to have clear frameworks so that is the main risk for us. SS: Are you getting a clear framework from Europe as well? We mentioned Brexit, we mentioned the concerns about cohesion within the EU as well. France has got a very big election which is already dividing the population as well, you have of course have had some political experience as well. What do you think about Europe in 2017? Are you worried that we're going to see more of the same that we saw of Renzi and Brexit? PP: I hope no. But I think that clearly for the European leaders it will be a very important year. we'll have new leadership coming; elections in France, in Germany, in the Netherlands and I think clearly, by the way, the position of Mr. Trump is provocative vis a vis Europe but maybe we need to be provocative and I hope for the leaders in Europe, we wake up and we build again the project. Clearly we have a problem today. We have a problem of leadership by the way. It's a question of leadership. We need leaders. I hope the new leaders in Europe will be able to offer a vision to European citizens in order to move the project forward. SS: Don't we have a leader in Europe, don't we have Frau Merkel? PP: Well yes [inaudible] Merkel but maybe we will have the next French President as well SS: ...isnt that your former boss Mr. Fillon. Total: Yeah. And I think he can be a leader for Europe. But again, it's not a choice for me, let me be very clear. I am chairman and CEO of Total, I make no politics in that. As I have said in France, I vote for Total, which is more important for me. SS: Tell us a bit more about Total in 2017 as well. Do you feel slightly less pressure though because of this oil price move, because actually you're renewables division I think from the latest numbers actually some of the profits coming from that as well. It's looking better as well. Do you feel less pressure in 2017 than perhaps at any stage in the last couple of years? Total: For sure, but we have less pressure because we've made huge efforts. All the teams of Total worked hard. We have lowered our break even under 50 dollars per barrel and in terms of cash break even with a profit of sales we're now under 40 dollars a barrel so yes we made big efforts and so over the last two years where we had a lot of CapEx because we had lots of projects or projects to be delivered, we have no higher production and or financials banking [inaudible] strong. So for me 2017 is a new era. We were under pressure. Now we can be more offensive. We have, I would say, a very good status in the company. And our objective is to benefit from still a low price because there is low cost so we want to sanction projects and we want to make new deals to have access to resources like the one we have done in Brazil in December and in Uganda with Turo [inaudible]. So Total has gone through these difficult two years in good shape. And I'm very happy now we can be more offensive. SS: Are you calling time on CapEx cuts? PP: No, no, we have what we announce is that we will spend between 15 and 17 billion dollars of CapEx from 2017. I explained to investors it is a sustainable level of CapEx, with that we will be able to continue to grow the company larger more than the market services, or target that [inaudible]. This is what we want to do. So it's not a CapExs it is landing the CapEx to the sustainable level, which is more important. SS: And in terms of the renewable side of things: You and I were in a debate in Davos talking about the transition, the energy transition, the clean energy transition as well. And there was lot of concern from Christiana Figueres about the speed of transition. Are you happy with Total's investment in renewables. Is it just right?  You mentioned 15 to 17 billion dollars.I think your investments, I mean various figures, 500 million dollars a year is the figure that it's often cited? PP: Yeah. Let's be realistic, energy is a very important matter. I mean we are in the core of the energy, we have invested in renewables we are investing and I believe when we develop a strategy because again we want to remain a major company in the energy field. Renewables we love something.  But today, if I only had renewables Total would be unable to distribute any dividends. It's still an infant industry but we need to work on it. So accelerating is tough because as we were discussing in Davos, people want not only clean energy, people want reliable energy, people want cheap energy, so we have to be pragmatic. SS: Is that the priority with people reliable and cheap, reliable and cheap ahead of clean? PP I think I suspect yes because its energy is at the core of the development, economic development and when you go to India, when you go to China you think people, of course they want clean, to be able to have clean air but they want also to have access to energy which is more important for many people in the world. So I don't think, so I think yes an energy mix will evolve. You will have less coal, less oil, more gas. More renewables but it takes time. This transition is not because you decide. It's not, there is no magic tool there. It's just a matter of investments and words [inaudible]  that people need are serious and pragmatic strategies to prepare the future. So I hear [inaudible]  acceleration I suspect we have to be pragmatic and realistic but again it's a serious matter. SS: There's another great point raised and it's by Oleg  Deripaska of Rusal that he thought that some countries and I'll paraphrase in some countries are pretty hypocritical really they're using renewables as cover for increasing coal production and coal usage as well. Do you think there's a great degree of hypocrisy out there from some companies and perhaps some countries especially. PP: No I don't think, I mean medically I don't think there is some hypocrisy but what Mr. Deripaska pointed is right. What I observe in many countries, because they have a lot of coal, coal is burnt out in China, is burnt out in India, in the US as well, is that and it's cheap to produce coal, much cheaper than gas because gas is complex, you need to liquify it and you need to transport it so what I observe is that you have many countries which try to be genuinely like India, on the road map of two degrees. We have this national production of coal and they invest in solar and wind. One hundred seventy five gigawatts by 2022. And I think the Prime Minister Modi is very dedicated to that. But yes we see a mix of coal and renewables. It's a strange mix but I observe this trend in Germany, I observe this trend in Japan. Japan wants to decrease gas and increase coal with renewables. So there's something there and I think it is one of the for me the main concern about the climate change debate because frankly if we are unable to lower the coal share in the mix, there is no chance we can reach the two degree road map [inaudible] and that requires you to pricing. SS: We need the carbon pricing. Finally, there's a lot of inequality concerns. There's a lot of concerns about the haves and have nots and if Davos is anything it's a lot of haves, it's a very rich concentration of very wealthy and influential people. Do you think the Davos bubble the Davos echo chamber actually gets the message that there's some real problems out there and they need resolving very quick. PP: Yeah you're right. Clearly we are in a bubble and we are in part of the bubble. And Total, when you speak about globalization is one of the winners of this globalisation. We have been able to develop a company. I think what is important to know is that yes we discussed about what is happening around us. I'm not sure we fully understand but there is really a willingness and we have been proposed by Davos to sign a compact about responsible leadership. Responsible leadership for me it's very important. I think big companies like us it's not only a matter to distribute salaries to employees, dividends, social orders, taxes to states. It's not enough. By listening to all of these moves but we need to bring something else to the territories from which we work. You know we have the global company for us for example in France first. Then we moved out. We are moving because we are a global company because the cost of labour is lower in other countries. But if we stay, if we leave the territories behind us without taking care, I think we are making a mistake. Normally the states should take care of that but the states are unable and so it's back to what is the responsibility of a global corporation like Total and I think there is a fourth dimension, salaries, dividends, taxes plus something which is to take care also of our own territories. And I think we need to move on that and not only to think it's a matter for all of us. It's not a problem of all of us. It's our problems because I strongly believe globalisation is a good thing for the world. We have major poverty in the world. We have plenty of emerging countries. But all population in all developed countries seem to disagree so why they disagree because they are afraid so we need to answer them. And it's not only a politician story, it's also a matter for the leaders of large corporations like Total. I don't have the magic tool there again but I am convinced that we need to do that and to tell the people we were discussing these type of matters amongst the leaders of the world in Davos so it's not only we are yes, it's a bubble but this bubble is asking itself some questions. And it's important. ","Interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total from the World Economic Forum 2017",0.9998

Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

627,Dan Caplinger,1192017,Fool,1122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","

Wall Street trading over the past several days has been subdued as investors await signs that the stock-market rally that followed President-elect Donald Trump’s November election victory, supported by his campaign promises to increase fiscal spending, cut taxes and roll back regulations, is based in reality and underpinned by solid corporate quarterly results.

Read: Trump is waving adios to the longstanding ‘strong-dollar policy’ Economic docket: On the economic front, the consumer-price index, a widely watched gauge of inflationary pressure, showed price growth accelerated in 2016 at the fastest pace since 2011. In December, the index rose 0.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 0.2%. The reading was in line with investor expectations and had little impact on stock futures. U.S. industrial output accelerated last month at its strongest pace in two years. The housing-market index from the National Association of Homebuilders showed that builder sentiment slipped in January after notching its highest reading of the business cycle in December.

629,,1262017,Reuters,1192017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

Investors will not only be looking at how the company performed in 2016, but will also be eager to get a sense of the company’s investment plans for 2017. Oil companies have aggressively scaled back capital expenditures since the oil price downturn in 2014. The chart below shows capital expenditure for ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP), which collectively fell by 47.3% from 2013 to 3Q-2016. This has left some industry experts wondering if spending reductions have gone too far. For example, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih has warned that there could by a global oil shortage as soon as 2020 if investment flows continue to be scaled back. In an investor presentation in November 2016 posted on Chevron’s website, the company says it plans to reduce capital and exploratory spending again in 2017 by about 25% from planned 2016 spending. Friday’s results should provide an update into whether these spending cuts are being accelerated or scaled back in a rising oil price environment. Some companies are already boosting investment spending. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China's largest offshore oil explorer, CNOOC (CEO), is planning to increase investment spending in 2017 between 19% and 39% for the first time since 2014. The marginal spending increase is equivalent to approximately $8.7 to $10.2 billion, or equal to roughly half of Chevron’s entire 2017 budgeted capital spending. 2017 will likely be a pivotal year for the oil industry. Those companies increasing investment spending could benefit if oil prices continue their upward path. A renewed downturn in prices, however, could see those who increased spending nursing large losses. On the other hand, companies that are scaling back investments could see their long term competitiveness eroded, especially if the oil shortage predicted by Saudi energy minister comes to pass.

632,Patti Domm,1262017,CNBC,1192017,"President Donald Trump could lift sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine by himself — and may justify doing so by saying that he is putting America first. Trump is expected to discuss the sanctions when he speaks by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview Friday. The White House also announced that Trump has separate calls with the leaders of Germany and France, two U.S. NATO allies that support sanctions on Russia. ""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said regarding Russia sanctions at a press conference on Friday. ""As far as the sanctions, it's very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally."" The U.S. sanctions, imposed through executive order by President Barack Obama, can be lifted by Trump's pen — without the vote of Congress — if he so wishes, experts said. It's not clear whether his intention is to lift sanctions right away, but Trump's first official discussion with Putin could lay the groundwork for removal. ""People said Trump will never remove the sanctions on Russia. Of course he will. It's a leveling of the playing field for U.S. corporations,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities research at RBC. The sanctions against Russia hurt that country's energy industry and make it harder for Russia to raise capital. Getting rid of the sanctions is a major priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. companies, including Exxon Mobil, were forced to drop activities in Russia if they were in new areas of development, such as Arctic drilling and Russian shale. But Croft explained that European companies, under separate European Union sanctions, were allowed to continue work on existing projects while being barred only from new ones. Based on Trump's rapid-fire execution of orders in his first week, such as directing the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, experts say it's possible he could move toward lifting sanctions against Russia. He could do so without the consent of European allies, which have sanctioned Russia separately. ""Clearly, he really wants this relationship to work. I have some sympathy in the sense the U.S. relationship with Russia has been very badly damaged, and a lot of that has Obama to blame,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of global political consultancy Eurasia Group. Trump has been moving toward lifting the sanctions already. ""He has so many of his speaking points aligned with those of the Kremlin, around Crimea, Ukraine, around Syria, around American exceptionalism and values,"" Bremmer said. Trump also seems bent to to move forward without gaining agreement from historic allies in Europe. ""If I were advising Trump, I would want him to be coordinating with Merkel and others who were steadfast allies ... I think he's made up his mind on this,"" said Bremmer. ""I guess what we've been learning about Trump is that he actually does what he said he was going to do. The problem is the sanctions were imposed for what the Russians did in Ukraine and Crimea. The Germans have worked hard to keep this together, as the French president has,"" said Professor Angela Stent, director Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. ""This would send a message to Russia that it can get away with it, but it undermines the European Union's efforts to hold Russia accountable."" Obama first imposed sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea, claiming it to be part of Russia. ""It's the Europeans who did it much later when the (Malaysian) airline was shot down over Ukraine,"" Stent said. Bremmer expects Trump to move forward regardless of prevailing sentiment Europe, where nationalist candidates stand to gain ground in several elections this year. In France, Marine Le Pen has gained in polls. She says she wants to get rid of the euro currency. ""Germany is the country that's in the most vulnerable position because of Trump, compared to most of the American allies. Europe is getting weaker. He likes Brexit, says other countries should leave. Germany is the country most interested in maintaining a strong Europe, and Trump is undermining (Merkel). Trump is renouncing American exceptionalism, in not telling other countries what to do,"" said Bremmer. At the same press conference where Trump spoke on Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May was forthright in saying that sanctions against Russia should continue until Russia conforms agreements designed to reduce fighting in Ukraine. Bremmer believes Trump will move forward quickly. But other experts say Trump may ease sanctions slowly — and therefore less visibly — rather than tossing them out right after taking office. Critics have called out Trump for praising Vladimir Putin, whom U.S. intelligence concluded was personally involved in trying to undermine last year's U.S. presidential election and help get Trump elected. Rex Tillerson, Trump's candidate for Secretary of State who just retired as CEO of ExxonMobil, and has strong personal links to Moscow and his former company has billions at stake in Russia. Trump initially refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russian officials intentionally meddled in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic National Committee computers. Trump has since vowed to make the U.S. more secure from cyber espionage, but has said nothing about punishing Russia. There is also another consideration. Tillerson has yet to be approved by the Senate. Tillerson was questioned by Congress on his feelings about Russia. One strategist said Trump may not lift sanctions right away because of the Tillerson vote, expected next week. Exxon has one of the most high-profile projects that was disrupted by sanctions, an Arctic drilling deal with Rosneft. The joint venture with Russian state-controlled oil giant was to explore and produce fossil fuels in Arctic waters, and it represents a big part of Exxon's potential future production growth. The sanctions were imposed in 2014, and Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its ""maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures"" totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Russian projects were able to find some other funding sources, including China. Rosneft recently raised funds by selling an $11 billion stake to Qatar and Glencore. If the sanctions are lifted, Croft said the knee jerk reaction in the oil market would likely be a decline in prices just because of the prospect of more supply. Under the sanctions, Russia actually was able to increase its oil production, and the decline in the ruble actually helped producers by keeping production costs lower. Croft said the move in oil prices would be temporary, since the new supply from Russia would not be immediate, and Russia is part of a producers group, with OPEC, that has agreed to cut back production to keep oil prices at a higher level. If the sanctions are lifted, one area of immediate interest would be in the potential for Russian shale. The Bazhenov Shale formation in the West Siberian basin is believed to hold massive reserves of tight oil — which can be reached by U.S.-pioneered technology that Russia can't access because of the sanctions — and that could be one of the first places companies might want to invest. ""Russian oil production has been strong, and it's actually increased until the OPEC deal. It could mean a renewal of Western investment in Russian oil, in the new areas in terms of tight oil, Arctic and offshore,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of research firm IHS Markit. ""The taste for big expensive long term projects is a lot lower today than it was when the sanctions were imposed. One area that is very interesting is tight oil in Russia."" Tight oil has been much cheaper to extract through horizontal drilling than deep water projects. ""There's a debate about how prolific it is,"" said Yergin, who said the Bazhenov by all signs is a huge reserve and would take a while to develop. ""If the analysis of U.S. shale is used, it could be very significant. I think all these development take time, and it takes a lot of experience to determine all of these resources and how to recover it. Certainly it would be a whole new horizon for Russian oil,"" he said. ",President Trump could say 'America first' to end sanctions on Russia,0.9917
633,Fred Imbert,1262017,CNBC,1192017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Thursday, with real estate falling around 1 percent, as investors eagerly awaited President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. ""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued. Bank of New York Mellon and Union Pacific were among the companies reporting before the bell, with Dow components IBM and American Express set to report after the close. Video streaming giant Netflix saw its shares rose 3.8 percent, having posted solid results on strong subscriber growth. Overseas, European equities traded mostly lower after the European Central Bank kept monetary policy unchanged. The euro briefly fell versus the dollar after ECB President Mario Draghi said in a news conference there is no sign of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 19,732.40, with Exxon Mobil leading decliners and UnitedHealth the biggest advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 8.20 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 2,263.69, with real estate leading nine sectors lower and industrials and telecommunications as the only risers.

Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","
      
    The Best Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors -- The Motley Fool

635,Matthew DiLallo,1262017,Fool,1192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. It would be an understatement to say that 2016 was a tough year for the oil patch. Plunging crude prices heading into the year forced producers to reduce investment spending so deeply that many couldn't even drill enough wells needed to keep production flat. Because of these market conditions, oil companies spent minuscule amounts of capital exploring for new oil and gas sources. As a result, the industry found the fewest new barrels of oil in 70 years. According to a report by energy research firm Rystad Energy, oil companies discovered a mere 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) last year outside of North American shale plays. For perspective, the U.S. alone consumes more than 7 billion barrels annually, which meant the industry did not come close to replacing consumption last year. Meanwhile, offshore discoveries, which is where companies uncovered most of the new sources of oil in recent years, fell 90% from 2010's level to just 2.3 billion BOE last year. This trend is not one that can continue given that world oil demand is not expected to peak until 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Image source: ConocoPhillips. The primary driver of last year's decline was the continued drop in exploration spending. Energy companies only spent $40 billion on exploratory drilling last year, which resulted in 40% fewer wells drilled than in 2014 when prices started on their downward spiral. Global oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for example, cut its global capital and exploratory budget by 24% from 2015's level to $26.6 billion. However, Chevron only earmarked $1 billion of that budget for exploration, well below the $3 billion budget the company set for 2015. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) cut its global exploration and appraisal budget down to $1.4 billion last year, a decline of 22% from 2015. Another culprit behind last year's low level of oil discoveries is that several exploration prospects came up dry. For example, a joint venture between ConocoPhillips, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) struck out in its initial attempt at finding oil in the Shelburne Basin off Canada's Atlantic Coast. As a result, Suncor Energy noted that it had to write off its share of the costs, which totaled 105 million Canadian dollars. That dry hole was one of a growing number of deepwater exploration failures for ConocoPhillips in recent years. In 2015, the company noted that a deepwater exploration well in Angola found a non-commercial gas column and another in the Gulf of Mexico did not encounter any hydrocarbons. As a result, it plugged and abandoned both wells, writing off $142 million in dry hole expenses. These and other dry holes drove its decision to exit deepwater exploration altogether. Image source: Suncor Energy Inc. While oil discoveries were down significantly, oil companies still found several notable new oil and gas deposits. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), for example, announced in June that an offshore well in Guyana confirmed a world-class oil discovery. According to ExxonMobil, this deposit contains between 800 million to 1.4 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Then, in October, the oil giant confirmed a discovery offshore Nigeria that holds between 500 million to 1 billion barrels of oil. Finally, the company capped the year off with a December announcement of a new onshore natural gas discovery in Papua New Guinea. Energy companies made several other smaller discoveries around the world last year. Norwegian oil giant Statoil (NYSE:EQNR), for example, finished up its Canadian Atlantic exploration program last year, which resulted in two more discoveries and the confirmation that its 2013 Bay du Nord find contains between 300 million to 600 million barrels of recoverable oil. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell made a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at its Fort Sumter prospect, uncovering more than 125 million BOE. That was one of three new Gulf finds last year, though that is down from seven in 2015. Image source: Apache Corporation. While offshore discoveries proved tougher to locate, North American onshore shale plays continued to be the gifts that keep on giving. One of the most notable shale discoveries was Apache's (NYSE:APA) Alpine High play in a sleepy part of Texas' Permian Basin. Apache believes that there's at least 3 billion barrels of oil and another 75 trillion cubic feet of gas in just two of the five rock formations underneath its acreage position in the region. Apache believes that the other formations could also contain significant quantities of recoverable hydrocarbons. On top of that, several other producers increased their estimates for ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries from their acreage position in various shale plays. One of the most notable was EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), which more than doubled its Permian Basin net resource potential from 2.35 billion BOE to 6 billion BOE. That upward revision came just a year after EOG Resources boosted its resource estimate in the region by 1 billion BOE due to improved recoveries resulting from advances in technology. The decline in offshore oil and gas discoveries will not have an immediate impact on global oil supplies. That is because it can often take a decade or more to turn offshore finds into production due to the high costs and long construction lead times. Furthermore, there's plenty of prior deepwater discoveries to develop as well as a plethora of shale resources to unleash. That said, the lack of new discoveries in recent years could prove problematic a decade from now as producers deplete currently producing fields. Given the forecast that oil demand will not peak for several decades, it suggests that the world will need to continue uncovering and developing new oil deposits. That means the industry cannot continue the recent history of failing even to come close to replacing production because there will come a point where this shortfall will impact supply. Such an event could cause a significant run-up in oil prices while producers race to meet the market's needs. ","
      
    Oil Companies Just Had Their Worst Year Since 1940 -- The Motley Fool

636,Michael Brush,1262017,MarketWatch,1192017,"Published: Jan 24, 2017 9:50 a.m. ET These are the companies that may benefit the most, according to a survey of analysts and fund managers By Donald Trump’s critics like to claim he doesn’t stand for anything. But that’s just because they haven’t looked hard enough. In speeches, online campaign policy messages and even tweets, Trump has regularly detailed policy reforms especially for business and the economy. These include lower taxes, fiscal stimulus, incentives to bring earnings home and protectionist policies. Though he didn’t add any details in his inauguration speech — and that’s never the point of this ceremonial address — his “America first” theme underscored his intent to enact those policies. After all, those policies basically put U.S. companies and the U.S. economy first. Will he actually get all of this done? No one knows. But with so many friends in Congress, and a majority there, it would be a mistake to count him out. As we’ve seen, prognosticators who discount Trump have a way of ending up looking dumb. So as the new president starts his first week in the White House, this is a good time to take stock of companies that will benefit the most from key Trump business and economic policies, according to Wall Street analysts. Here’s a comprehensive roundup. Companies with sales in the good ol’ US of A Trump has made it clear he wants some form of protectionism as a cornerstone of his economic policy. For better or worse, and whatever form this takes, it’s likely to benefit companies that generate most of their sales at home. Those companies will also get a direct shot of assistance from fiscal stimulus. They’ll get a relative boost from any ongoing strength in the dollar, since this reduces reported earnings for companies that get much of their earnings overseas. Goldman Sachs singles out the following companies as potential Trump policy beneficiaries because they generate virtually all of their revenue in the U.S. Naturally, many of them are in retail, and consumer products and services. Candidates for a Trump bump here include: Lowe’s

That’s because the new president is likely to take steps to block subsidized steel from China sold here below cost. “We are going to have greater scrutiny on steel tariffs and how much steel is imported,” says Marshall. U.S. steel companies will also benefit from a rebound in infrastructure spending and manufacturing. “A lot of them are at 60% capacity,” says Marshall. “We think it could get closer to 80% or 90%.” One of his favorites is Commercial Metals

                                   in this space. Companies with low labor costs The labor markets are so tight at 4.7% unemployment, companies have to bid up wages to get or keep workers. This is why average hourly wages recently saw the biggest jump since 2009, at 2.9%. Now, Trump wants to apply fiscal stimulus in the form of personal and corporate tax cuts, and more spending on the military, veterans benefits and infrastructure. That’s an unorthodox policy at full employment, because it risks sparking so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to get overly aggressive in raising rates — which could spook markets. All of this remains to be seen as a risk. In the meantime, with labor costs clearly on the march and greater wage pressure ahead, thanks to Trump stimulus, it makes sense to favor companies that don’t spend a lot on labor, relative to revenue. A group of low-labor-cost companies suggested by Goldman Sachs late last year has vastly outperformed companies with high labor costs. Analysts at the investment bank expect this to continue in 2017, as wages continue to go up and the market prices in higher inflation. As an added plus, the low-labor-cost companies singled out by Goldman Sachs, below, have faster sales and earnings growth compared with high-labor-cost companies. Consumer-facing low-labor-cost companies favored as winners by Goldman Sachs include: Netflix

                                    QCOM, -0.41% Companies that pay high taxes After Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act lowered taxes in October 1986, large-cap companies paying the highest tax rates beat the broad market for the next three years, points out Credit Suisse analyst Lori Calvasina. So now with Trump looking to lower the corporate tax rate, it makes sense to go with companies that pay high tax rates. Trump wants a 15% corporate tax rate. House Republican lawmakers propose a 20% rate. But even a reduction to 25% would boost S&P 500 Index

                                   earnings by 8%, say analysts at Goldman Sachs. As an added plus, many of the high-tax-rate companies also generate most, or all, of their sales at home. That makes them less vulnerable to steps to penalize importers and bigger direct beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus. Stocks to consider because they pay the highest effective tax rates, according to Goldman Sachs, include: Goodyear Tire & Rubber

For now, it’s probably better to stay away from this group, as a Trump play. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword,” says Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. It’s also tough to know at this point which defense programs and services will get priority, says Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi. For now it’s probably best to simply monitor the group for trading opportunities. Lockheed fell hard on Dec. 23 when Trump tweeted negatively about F-35 program costs. But it then went on to post 4% gains in two weeks as it recovered from the Trump twitter storm. Infrastructure plays This group is another tough one. Yes, our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling. You see this all the time when you drive around. And Trump’s plan to boost infrastructure spending would no doubt help this space, especially materials companies like Vulcan Materials

                                    SUM, +4.42% But infrastructure plays face three challenges. 1. The earliest the industry could see any measurable spending benefit from Trump policies would be 2018, said economists Kermit Baker of the American Institute of Architects and Ken Simonson at the Associated General Contractors of America at a lunch recently sponsored by Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy. But it’s more likely to arrive in 2019. That’s a long way off. 2. Trump’s immigration policies could aggravate the construction labor shortage. Immigrants make up 30% of construction labor. 3. The group has rallied a lot, despite those challenges. “Our concern is that something will break investor euphoria,” says Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Indeed, this is a risk for all “Trump plays” and the market in general. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5% since Election Day, which means investors have priced in a lot of Trump success. If he stumbles at all in his legislative agenda, the market could reverse itself, especially because investor sentiment is so high. But as we saw during the campaign, Trump has a way of getting what he wants. So any reversal in the market, and especially the names above, on a Trump stumble will probably be a buying opportunity.

637,,2022017,Reuters,1262017,"The world’s largest publicly traded oil producer wrote down the book value of part of its North American natural gas and crude reserves, some of which were acquired in 2009’s all-stock buyout of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time. After conducting an annual asset review, Exxon said the value of some reserves in North America’s Rocky Mountain region should be lowered due to weak performance and its own tepid outlook on the potential for future commodity price rises. Exxon declined to provide its internal forecast for oil and gas prices. Exxon will report estimates for the value of its proved reserves in February. The $2 billion impairment charge likely will reduce the value of the proved reserves. Wall Street traders expect oil prices to stay near their current range, between $54 and $55 per barrel, for several years and for natural gas prices to remain near their current level, about $3.13 per million cubic feet. <0#CLCAL:> NG12Mst The 14 percent boost in capital expenditures and the writedown reflect a delicate balancing act by oil and natural gas companies in an era of extreme volatility after a two-year price rout. The higher spending is not due to rising prices for oilfield contract work or other services, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon’s vice president of investor relations, said on an earnings conference call with investors. “It is, by an large, a function of activity level” increasing, Woodbury said. Exxon’s announcement came after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. The results reflected the slow and steady improvement in the global oil and gas industry as commodity prices inch higher after a two-year rout. The quarterly report was Exxon’s first under Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. Rex Tillerson, the former CEO, has been nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be secretary of state and is awaiting confirmation. Fourth-quarter earnings fell to $1.68 billion, or 41 cents per share, from $2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding the $2 billion writedown, Exxon earned 90 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production fell 3 percent to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this month Exxon said it would pay up to $6.6 billion to double its holdings in the oil-rich Permian Basin of west Texas, the largest oil field in the United States. Shares of Texas-based Exxon fell 1.7 percent to $83.40 in afternoon trading. ","

638,Tom DiChristopher,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Exxon Mobil beat earnings forecasts on Tuesday as revenues increased, though the company took a $2 billion impairment charge, mostly due to lowering the value of some of its U.S. gas assets. Excluding one-time items, Exxon reported a fourth-quarter profit of 90 cents a share, versus Wall Street expectations of 70 cents a share. Results for the Irving, Texas-based oil giant were helped by belt-tightening throughout 2016. However, persistently low oil prices and weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business weighed on earnings for the full year. ""Financial results for the year were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in commodity prices and the impairment charge,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. Shares of Exxon slipped about 1 percent Tuesday. Evercore analyst Doug Teresson said many market watchers were focused on the charge. Including that impairment, Exxon would have missed profit forecasts. ""The market did view the result negatively because they missed the headline number, but that's really only because of ... impairments for Exxon, which are non-recurring. And so the clean results were actually similar to consensus, but they were just messy,"" he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report."" Excluding that charge, Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.7 billion, or 90 cents a share. In the period a year ago, it reported earnings of $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share. Revenues for the most recent quarter were $61.01 billion, compared with expectations of $62.28 billion. Exxon said it will increase its 2017 capital spending program, which includes exploration, to an estimated $22 billion. In 2016, capital spending fell 38 percent to $19.3 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from a year ago in all three of the company's major segments: exploration and production, refining and chemicals. The $2 billion impairment resulted from the company's review of its reserves. Exxon determined that some of its U.S. assets' future cash flows no longer exceeded their carrying value. These were primarily in the Rockies. Exxon warned last quarter it would have to revise the amount of unproduced resources it holds if oil prices remained low through the end of the year. In the current price environment, the resources would no longer qualify as proven reserves under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company said at the time. Liquid petroleum products fetched a higher price than they did a year ago. That was partially offset by weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon have seen their refining margins shrink as the price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels, stabilizes above $50 a barrel. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry — improved significantly from last year. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. Cash flow from asset sales was also higher, hitting $2.1 billion, versus about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last week, the company announced a dividend of 75 cents, unchanged from the third quarter. ",Exxon Mobil profit and revenue rise as the oil giant takes $2 billion impairment,0.9556
639,Rebecca Ungarino,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Energy, the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, could see further pain. Chevron, one of the top-weighted holdings in a popular energy ETF (the XLE) fell nearly 2 percent on Monday after posting disappointing quarterly earnings Friday, and Exxon Mobil and Schlumberger closed down about 1 percent each. Crude oil, which has generally moved in tandem with energy names for the last year, has fallen 2 percent in 2017. In a note Monday, Miller Tabak managing director Matt Maley said the XLE is nearing a critical multiyear trend line that if broken could mean the energy sector ""is getting quite close to a compelling decline."" In addition, some strategists noted, futures traders' crude oil positions as expressed in commitment of trader data are at historic extremes, with their longest positions on record. This is quite the contrarian indicator, Maley wrote, as the ""specs"" are ""almost always wrong at extremes."" ""In other words, there are A LOT of people on the bullish side of the boat in crude oil,"" Maley wrote, while ""commercials"" in the energy space have their largest short positions ever. The extreme positioning gives pause to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who sees downside ahead for energy. ""Now when you talk about energy stocks, you have to remember it was the best-performing sector last year, but most of that was a function of a reversal of it being the worst-performing sector for much of 2014 and 2015. And the bulk of that gain came in the early part of last year. So if you weren't overweight energy stocks by April, you missed out on most of the outperformance,"" Krinsky said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" And now, Krinsky said, the opposite is occurring; the XLE relative to the S&P 500 as well as on an absolute basis is beginning to break down below its uptrend line back to early 2015, echoing some of Maley's sentiment. However, Eddy Elfenbein, editor of the Crossing Wall Street blog, likes energy at this juncture in light of recently agreed-upon production cuts from OPEC.   ""I think it's just an unwinding of some of the recent trades. I mean, oil has had a spectacular year since the lows of about a year ago,"" Elfenbein said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""    The XLE is up 25 percent in the last year. Elfenbein noted the energy sector's poor performance over the last seven weeks or so, but sees upside in roughly six months to a year as crude oil production cuts will take some time to play out.    ""The key, this is the big game changer is that the OPEC cuts that they announced in November, these were the first major cuts in eight years, they're actually working. OPEC… they never cooperate. And it really is working this time,"" Elfenbein said, adding that such cuts had put a ""floor"" of sorts at the $50 a barrel level.     Still, the technicals in Krinsky's eyes don't appear promising.   ""We don't think it's going to be anything like we saw in 2015, but [the] XLE probably has some more downside, lower to mid-60s,"" Krinsky said, adding that although the ETF is still well above its 200-day moving average, the extreme positions are reason enough to believe underperformance will continue in the near term.

The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Boeing is running into trouble this week and now faces a critical technical test, according to one technician. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter. Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Michael Bapis of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management discuss whether the stock is a social safety trade.

640,Tom DiChristopher,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"Shares of Chevron gave up about 2 percent of their value in pre-market trading Friday as the oil giant turned in quarterly results that badly missed estimates. Chevron executives pointed to lower margins in its refining business and tax charges as drags on earnings during a conference call. They also said layoffs were largely behind them, but the company would continue looking for ways to drive down costs. The company also said it will be able to fund spending and dividends in 2017 with cash generated from operations, following a downturn that forced oil giants and smaller drillers alike to tap debt and other to sources to pay for normal business operations. ""Our 2016 earnings reflect the low oil and gas prices we saw during the year,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement. ""We responded aggressively to those conditions, cutting capital and operating expenses by $14 billion."" Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said on the conference call Chevron is considering more assets sales. ""Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017,"" she said. Last month, the company said it would lower its capital spending for a fourth consecutive year. Chevron's $19.8 billion program for 2017 will focus on projects with shorter cycles and higher returns aimed at producing oil and gas within two years. That includes more drilling in the the U.S. Permian basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, which is leading the nation's shale oil recovery, Watson said. The company said it was operating 10 oil rigs in the region and planning to add another about every eight weeks, he said on Friday. Chevron also provided updates on its critical Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, which experienced some shutdowns in 2016, as well as its Wheatstone natural gas hub. Watson acknowledged the first phase of Gorgon's ramp-up missed expectations and said Chevron would apply those lessons to future phases there and at Wheatstone. He said the next phase of Gorgon would start processing LNG early in the second quarter. Phase one of Wheatstone is scheduled for mid-2017, with phase two expected six to eight months later. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $415 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had expected Chevron to earn 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. In the year-ago period, Chevron reported a loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, shortly before oil prices hit 12-year lows. Low crude oil and gas prices throughout much of 2016 pushed the oil giant to a loss for the year. For 2016, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million, or 27 cents a share. Cash flow, a key measure of corporate health in the oil and gas industry, was $12.8 billion in 2016, down from $19.5 billion the previous year. Chevron spent $22.4 billion on capital projects and exploration last year, down from $34 billion in 2015, reflecting the industry trend of reducing expenses to weather the downturn. Chevron saw results improve from the year-ago period in its upstream business, which includes exploration and production of fossil fuels. The company chalked that up to lower exploration and operating expenses and its oil and gas fetching a higher price. Oil prices stabilized above $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter after OPEC and other major oil producers agreed to cut production. In the downstream segment, which includes refining and marketing fuel, Chevron saw fourth-quarter profits slide both in the United States and abroad. The company broke even in its U.S. downstream business, compared with profits of $496 million a year ago. Integrated oil companies such as Chevron have seen their refining margins shrink on the rising price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 7 percent from sales of $28 billion a year ago. On Wednesday, the San Ramon, California-based oil giant announced a quarterly dividend of $1.08 a share, unchanged from the previous quarter, when it hiked the shareholder payout by a penny.

641,Fred Imbert,2022017,CNBC,1262017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Monday, notching their worst day of the year, as a new measure taken by the Trump administration on immigration sent jitters through the market. President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday that would temporarily bar entry into the U.S. to Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens. The order seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. In signing the order, Trump said he pledged to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America."" ""We spent the first two months [following the election] focusing on the positives for companies. What we're seeing here is  that life is not a straight line,"" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. ""Perhaps the market is looking at the other side of things. Maybe the Trump administration is not going to do all the things businesses want."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell around 120 points after sliding more than 223.39 points, dropping below 20,000, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent, with energy shedding 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling 0.8 percent. ""I think it also has to do with what the immigration policy represents [in terms of] the way the Trump administration is going to operate,"" said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. ""The fact is that you've got a major policy that was implemented very quickly. That's causing uncertainty."" The order sparked outrage as thousands took to the streets across the U.S. in protest. Several world and corporate leaders also condemned the order. On Saturday, a federal judge issued an emergency stay to halt the deportation of people with valid visas who landed in the U.S. ""The Trump worries are now beginning to set in,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. ""We're having this ongoing worry effect that could overtake earnings and economic data."" The U.S. stock market has seen a massive rally since Trump's election, with the S&P and Dow advancing 7.25 percent and 9.61 percent since Nov. 8, respectively. ""You're coming off all-time highs on virtually every index,"" said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds. ""It doesn't take much for people to take a breather."" Traders have bet on Trump's promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation that would boost growth, just as earnings have begun growing again. ""While investors were very quick to price in the expected impact that deregulation, infrastructure spending and job growth could have on the U.S. economy, I find it very difficult to believe that after pricing in heavy premiums based on fiscal promises, that investors are not now reconsidering what damage Trump might do by implementing other promises that supplemented an incoherent and ranting political campaign,"" said Jameel Ahmad, vice president of research at FXTM. ""Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the U.S.,"" Ahmad said. In economic news, pending home sales for December rose 1.6 percent, while personal income rose 0.3 percent, below an expected increase of 0.4 percent. The data releases come a day before the Federal Reserve kicks off its first monetary policy meeting of the year. The central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percent at its December meeting. However, market expectations for a rate following this meeting are just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""I'm as enthused as anyone about tax cuts (even though we don't know what final form will look like) and regulatory relief (but worried about trade protectionism and immigration bans),"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. ""But to think that somehow the Fed is no longer relevant to both the economy and markets as they step up rate hikes I think is delusional,"" Boockvar said. U.S. Treasurys were mostly steady, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding near 2.496 percent and the short-term two-year note yield around 1.22 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.069 and the yen around 113.7. In corporate news, earnings season continues this week as the likes of Exxon Mobil, Apple, Facebook and UPS get set to report quarterly results. European stocks traded broadly lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.05 percent. In Asia, stocks also fell, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 dropping 0.51 percent. The Shanghai equity market was closed for the Chinese New Year holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.65 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 19,971.13, with Caterpillar leading decliners and Wal-Mart the top advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 13.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 2,280.90, with energy leading all nine sectors lower and consumer staples and utilities advancing. The Nasdaq composite slid 47.07 points, or 0.83 percent, to close 5,613.71. About three stocks declined for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 873.13 million and a composite volume of 3.585 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, rose 12.5 percent to around 11.9. Gold futures for April delivery rose $4.90 to settle at $1,196 an ounce.

ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) peers have written down and impaired the value of several of their assets since the beginning of this oil and gas downturn, but ExxonMobil had not yet done so. That changed this past quarter when the company took a $2 billion hit to the bottom line. Despite that large asset charge, ExxonMobil's results weren't all that bad. Let's take a look at the numbers to see why the fourth quarter should give some hope for the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: ExxonMobil earnings release. * In millions, except per-share data. Last quarter, management gave everyone a heads-up that we should expect a sizable asset writedown this quarter. Well, we got it. Management took a $2.02 billion asset impairment, mostly related to its dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains. This is a little bit of a surprise, actually. Based on the statement last quarter about taking oil and gas reserves off the books, there was the assumption that assets like its Canadian oil sands would be impaired. This writedown is pretty revealing, though. Management does writedowns based on discounted cash flows for those assets and the current carrying values of those assets. So reading the tea leaves into this impairment charge, we can come to two conclusions: The long life aspect of Canadian oil sands means that their asset value may not face as much risk as many might assume, and that there has been a permanent structural shift in natural gas production and pricing in the U.S. Aside from that one big change, the rest of ExxonMobil's results were par for the course. Downstream and chemical results suffered slightly from rising crude oil prices that impacted feedstock costs for these segments, and some favorable tax-related items gave its corporate segment a rare gain. DATA SOURCE:  EXXONMOBIL EARNINGS RELEASES. CHART BY AUTHOR. The one bright spot in the quarter was ExxonMobil's cash from operations. The $7.4 billion in cash was more than enough to cover its $4.8 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, but fell just short of also covering the $3.1 billion in dividend payments. The $2.1 billion in asset sales helped to make up for the rest without having to take on any additional debt, something few integrated oil and gas companies have been able to do lately. Management quickly put that excess cash generation to work as it reduced total debt by $3.4 billion to $42.8 billion. Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury gave his typical ""just the facts"" conference call, where he pointed out on multiple occasions that the company was generating more cash from operations than its capital budget. He said: ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day and maintain focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015, as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to push -- pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance, combined with continued investment and cost discipline, generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion, and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered the dividend and net investments in the business. ExxonMobil's results, even adding in the large asset impairment, weren't that bad. The big asset charge hides the fact that the company's cash generation has improved significantly compared to the prior quarter and portends a much better 2017. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of ExxonMobil, its analyst day presentation is on March 1, where it will go into detail about its production and spending outlook for the next several years.

    ExxonMobil's Earnings Slip on a Rare Writedown -- The Motley Fool

643,Tyler Crowe,2022017,Fool,1262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

644,Rich Smith,2022017,Fool,1262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

645,Barbara Kollmeyer,2022017,MarketWatch,1262017,"Published: Jan 31, 2017 3:39 p.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By Traders begging for nonpresidential drivers may get exactly that today, thanks to Apple and the start of a Fed meeting. “This week was supposed to be dominated by central banks’ decisions, earnings, and economic data from across the globe, but with Donald Trump in office, nothing seems capable of taking the spotlight from the White House.” That was FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed in a note that pretty much nails the mood. The jitters look set to stick around today, with some youngsters in for a #SaturdayNightMasscare history-refresher after Trump sent a defiant attorney general packing: Much debate now surrounds just when to start worrying about politics in earnest, and Sayed has one answer: “The major risk looming now is the breakup of the Republican coalition, although this doesn’t seem to be the case for now. I believe it’s going to be the biggest risk to financial markets in the near future, as we end up with protectionist policies without the implementation of fiscal policies, thus triggering a sharp reversal in stocks worldwide.” Our call of the day echoes this a bit. From Macro Man blogger Macronick comes the warning that markets could be headed for an “escalator up, elevator down” selloff. And “even a garden-variety 5% dip in the S&P would feel pretty vicious,” given the subdued state of volatility over the last two months, the blogger adds. If the Trump administration “overplays its hand,” eroding its relationship with the GOP, its much-anticipated infrastructure spending and tax-cut programs could get delayed or downsized, Macronick says. Then, harking back to the debt-ceiling shock of 2011, a prolonged political upset could start to hit growth and business confidence. Next would come a reflation reversal for stocks. While we’re not there yet, there’s plenty of time for more fireworks, says Macronick. “Investors have been viewing Trump as a second coming of Reagan,” the blogger adds. “They should remember his presidency may yet end up bearing much in common with Nixon’s—a period marked by widespread civil unrest and extreme animosity between the White House and press.” To be sure, strategists have been warning about Trump-inspired selling for a while, and the market has instead scored records.

649,Tyler Crowe,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

650,Rich Smith,2092017,Fool,2022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","
