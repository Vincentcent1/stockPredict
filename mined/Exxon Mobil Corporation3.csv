For the fifth year in a row, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT), a company with an outsized physical store presence, has taken the top spot in Fortune magazine's ranking of the top 500 companies. The Arkansas-based company, which is also the world's largest retailer, reported revenue of $485.8 billion last year. That figure is more than double the $223.6 billion revenue of second-place company on the list, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A). With reported revenue of $215.6 billion, tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL) rounded out the top three. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) dropped two places from last year to the fourth position, and pharma company McKesson Corporation (MCK) placed fifth. (See also: Fact Sheet: What Is the Fortune 500 List?) In recent years, investor sentiment has turned bearish toward Wal-Mart's future growth largely because the company has been slow on the uptake as far as e-commerce is concerned. However, an outsized revenue is not a guarantee of overall profits. On an overall basis, Wal-Mart ranked 11th in profits. The top spot in that category was taken by Apple, which reported profits of $45.7 billion. (See also: Wal-Mart to Consolidate Buying Operations.) Healthcare and pharma firms accounted for three of the top 10 largest companies in America, according to Fortune. Meanwhile, General Motors Company (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F) represented the automotive sector on the list. The tech sector, which has powered much of the S&P 500's growth this year, had only one company – Apple – within the top ten. In a display of the margins and efficiency that are possible within the tech sector, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) joined Apple among the top five most profitable companies. (See also: The Tech Bubble Will Burst: The Question Is When.) A change in the presidential administration has also brought about a change in priorities for Fortune 500 companies. According to a survey conducted by the publication, the rapid pace of tech innovation has displaced the threat of increased regulation as the most pressing concern for American CEOs.

Bob Pisani,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"For the second day in a row, value stocks (banks, energy) are outperforming growth stocks (technology). Has the time finally arrived for value stocks? Growth versus value is one of the oldest investment styles known. Value-buying stocks that are underpriced, according to some fundamental metric, such as price-to-book ratio, gained fame under Ben Graham and David Dodd, whose 1934 text ""Security Analysis"" is generally viewed as the bible of value investing, even though they never explicitly used the phrase ""value investing."" One thing is clear: buying growth stocks—those that are growing earnings at an above-average rate — has been a sound strategy this year. The iShares S&P Growth ETF (IVW) is up 12.5 percent year to date, while the iShares S&P Value (IVE) is up only 4.1 percent. Why is there such outperformance this year for growth? As a rule, growth stocks this year are technology, consumer discretionary, and health care. As a rule, value stocks this year are financials, energy, and consumer staples. It shouldn't surprise you that the reason growth has outperformed value is because of the huge outperformance of big-cap tech stocks. Here are the top holdings in the S&P Growth Index, by their weight in the index. S&P Growth: top holdingsApple: 7 percentMicrosoft: 4.8 percentAmazon: 3.4 percentFacebook: 3.1 percentGoogle: 2.6 percent These are the so-called ""FANG"" stocks (with Microsoft added) that everyone has been talking about this year. By contrast, the Value index's biggest names are energy and financials, which have all underperformed this year: For the past two days, we have seen a rotation out of tech outperformers and into energy and bank underperformers. This is a healthy sign: rather than just selling off, investors are using these over-owned technology names as a source of funds to buy underperforming energy and bank names. Will that continue? Opinions are divided. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, splits the difference by telling clients, ""We are not advising a style tilt at this point"" but notes the obvious: ""On a short-term basis, value's underperformance is moving to an extreme and due for a reprieve."" The good news is that the action in the past couple days is a good reminder that nothing goes in a straight line and the momentum guys can just as quickly abandon growth names, and have done so many times in the past. And growth does not have a monopoly on price appreciation: there are long periods when value does outperform. Lerner notes that while growth has outperformed value this year, growth underperformed value by 9 percent in 2016. ""Thus, over the entire period from 2016 until now, growth's outperformance is less extreme at less than 4%,"" Lerner notes. One final note: a common complaint about growth vs. value investing is that you get a lot of ""bleed,"" that is, because the parameters of what constitutes value and growth are a bit fuzzy, you can (and do) get stocks that have characteristics of both, so they are usually included in both indices. For example, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson are in both the Growth and Value indices. If this bothers you—that you can get the same stocks in two different investment styles that seem, well, opposite—you're not alone. There have been numerous attempts to create ""pure"" investment styles. Sticking with ETFs, one example is Guggenheim's S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) and S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) ETFs. Guggenheim splits the S&P into three groups: a growth basket that weights stocks on traditional growth fundamentals (sales and earnings growth, price momentum), a value basket that weights value stocks on traditional value fundamentals (price/book ratio, sales/price ratio, and earnings/price ratio), and a ""blend basket"" of stocks that have both growth & value attributes. It throws out the ""blend basket"" and creates funds that they believe how ""purer"" growth and value characteristics. The results? It sounds like a good idea, but at least this year there's not a huge difference between the performances of the S&P 500 Growth and Value and the ""Pure"" S&P 500 Growth and Value Indices: iShares S&P Growth (IVW) up 12.5 percentGuggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) up 12.8 percent iShares S&P Value (IVE) up 4.1 percent Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) up 3.8 percent The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Even as stocks were steadier Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, some charts still look dicey, and that could be a warning for the broader market.

John Bromels,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Two stocks. One price. Any buys? Currently, shares of Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) are both sitting just below $47/share. Earlier this year, though, Apache's per-share price was above $60, and Anadarko's was above $70! Let's look at which one of these beaten-down energy industry stocks is likely to have better performance for investors. Both Apache and Anadarko are building up their oil and gas assets in Texas, hoping to benefit from lower production costs. Image source: Getty Images. Apache and Anadarko each released their first-quarter 2017 earnings report in early May. Both companies performed better than the prior year, which is hardly surprising considering how much oil prices have increased since then. The companies' biggest rival ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), for example, saw a billion-dollar year-over-year improvement in earnings in Q1. Despite these improvements, all three companies' stock prices have suffered since. Anadarko saw impressive sales volume growth during the quarter -- up a divestiture-adjusted 20% year over year. It was also able to enhance its product mix to 61% liquids versus 53% in the year-ago quarter. Because liquids command higher prices, this improved the company's overall margins. In spite of that, though, the company still didn't manage to turn a profit during the quarter, posting an adjusted $330 million loss. Apache, on the other hand, posted a small profit, but on lower volumes than in the year-ago quarter. (although that wasn't unexpected). Revenue and cash flow were both up, and the company is seeing better-than-expected results from its Alpine High play (more on that later). Nevertheless, the market had hoped for more, sending shares downward after the announcement. Both companies are clearly benefiting from an improved oil market, although there's still a long way to go. However, a profit beats a loss, so this one goes to Apache. Especially in the current environment, when stocks across the industry are down and with no clear recovery on the horizon, a dividend can be a godsend for investors. The regular payout a dividend provides can reward investors for their patience as they wait for share prices to recover. Both Anadarko and Apache pay a dividend, although Apache's is much more robust. In early 2014, both companies increased their dividend payouts. Anadarko upped its dividend to $0.27/share, while Apache raised its to an even $0.25/share. Of course, shortly thereafter, the bottom fell out of the oil market, and the entire industry started to suffer. Anadarko held its dividend at that level for nearly two years, but eventually, Anadarko's management -- wisely, in my opinion -- bit the bullet and slashed its dividend to just $0.05/share, where it remains today. Apache, on the other hand, has been able to keep its dividend steady at $0.25/share and doesn't seem likely to cut it -- or, for that matter, raise it -- anytime soon. That gives Apache an attractive current yield of about 2.1%. Which is close to best-in-class ConocoPhillips' 2.4% yield. Of course, some of the integrated majors, like ExxonMobil or Royal Dutch Shell yield far more or have a longer history of increases, but 2.1% is not bad, especially compared to Anadarko's tiny 0.4% yield. The importance of past earnings and current dividend yield, though, pale in importance to a company's future prospects and performance. And both Apache and Anadarko are undergoing some changes that could have a big impact on their upcoming operations. For Anadarko, the changes stem from an April explosion at a home in Colorado, which killed two people. Investigators discovered that an abandoned return flowline connected to a nearby Anadarko-owned well hadn't been properly capped. Gas from a cut in the pipeline seeped into the home, causing the blast. As a result, Anadarko -- Colorado's largest gas producer -- was ordered to inspect all of its wells located within 1,000 feet of buildings. Anadarko wrapped up those inspections in early June and submitted a report to the state, but it's still unclear what further actions -- if any -- Anadarko might have to take. And of course, there are almost certain to be legal ramifications. Apache, on the other hand, is busily developing the infrastructure at its monster Alpine High find in the Delaware Basin of Texas. The area around the find had been ignored by the industry until recently, so Apache is basically starting from scratch, but it's currently ahead of schedule and under budget. The company estimates production won't be able to start in earnest until the second half of 2017, and it won't really take off until 2018. In the meantime, the infrastructure development coupled with some scheduled maintenance downtime in the company's North Sea operations is going to make for lackluster performance. The near-term outlook is uncertain for both companies -- particularly with oil prices dropping again. However, there's still a lot we don't know about Anadarko's Colorado operations and how the company will be affected overall. Apache's position -- sitting on a huge oil and gas find and just needing to build out some infrastructure -- seems much more secure. Apache may not have had the best performance so far this year, but it pays a nice dividend and has excellent prospects for growth once its Alpine High find comes online. In fact, these factors convinced me to put my own money into the stock in May. However, if things in Colorado can be resolved quickly for Anadarko, and if it can start turning a profit from its record production, it could still be worth a look. Today, though, Apache is the clear winner. ","

Reuben Gregg Brewer,06152017,Fool,06082017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In early 2017, discussions between BHP Billiton Limited (NYSE:BHP) and Elliott Management spilled out into the open. The activist investor is looking for BHP to make changes that it believes will enhance shareholder value, most notably spinning off the miner's oil business. Elliott has had success cajoling other companies to actions lately, notably metal parts maker Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), which means investors should be asking what will happen to BHP Billiton's oil business. Elliott has three main requests of BHP. The first is to simplify its corporate structure, which involves dual shares, buying back $6 billion worth of stock, and spinning off the company's oil business. BHP is pushing back on all three, suggesting that the company's unique corporate structure isn't an impediment to its business, it's not the right time to spend so much on share buybacks, and that the oil business is a good fit for BHP. Image source: Getty Images. The demands are notable because of Elliott Management's track record. For example, it recently got into a public spat with Arconic. In that case the dissident investor was looking for the ouster of the CEO and additional board seats. In the end, Arconic's CEO left the company and Elliott and Arconic came to terms about the board without having to resort to a disputed shareholder vote. Elliott also took on technology giant Samsung. In this case it wanted Samsung to restructure its business as a holding company. Although Elliott didn't get what it wanted, Samsung did agree to cancel treasury shares and to start paying a dividend. I count that as another broad win. BHP doesn't like Elliott's ideas very much. Image source: BHP Billiton. So it's legitimate to wonder how long BHP can resist with Elliott pushing for change. Saying no to changing the dual corporate structure is relatively easy. Making that change would be technically difficult, time consuming, and would require regulatory approval. It's probably not worth the effort since the current structure hasn't really been much of an impediment so far. Share buybacks on the scale that Elliott is asking, meanwhile, would require BHP to use roughly 40% of the cash it has on its balance sheet or the issuance of new debt. It could easily afford the expense, but BHP says it would rather have additional balance sheet flexibility right now. I'm willing to take management at its word on this one, but it's probably not a big deal either way. The last requested change, however, is a big one: Jettisoning the oil business. Elliott makes a good case for a spin-off. For example, drilling for oil is a different business than mining iron ore, copper, and metallurgical coal. BHP suggests that its knowledge of geology gives it an edge here. I'm not so sure being that it competes with oil industry giants like ExxonMobil. Oil is a big part of BHP's future, for now. Image source: BHP Billiton. That said, the company's oil assets do separate it from competitors like Rio Tinto plc and Vale SA that don't drill for oil. It clearly gives BHP a unique level of diversification. And oil is a big business for BHP, accounting for around 20% of underlying EBITDA through the first six months of the current fiscal year. Moreover, over the last five years the oil business' EBITDA margin exceeded that of all of its mining segments. This is a notable and profitable business and BHP has big plans for it. BHP, however, can't claim that its oil business has been a perfect investment. In early 2016 it announced it was writing down the value of its U.S. shale oil assets by roughly $7 billion. Adding that to earlier write-offs brings the total to around $13 billion on roughly $20 billion in investments in the U.S. shale space. Clearly, Elliott can easily point to mistakes that have been made that suggest BHP shouldn't be in the oil business. But that's just one part of the company's oil portfolio and BHP has started looking at ""alternatives"" for its U.S. shale operations. The rest of the oil business, however, isn't included in this process. It appears that BHP is hoping to give Elliott a little something so it doesn't have to give the dissident shareholder everything it wants. For now, based on BHP's pushback against Elliott, getting out of the U.S. shale business is probably all that investors should expect to see happen in BHP's oil business. At the end of the day, that's probably not a bad thing. BHP just went through a huge spin off, jettisoning assets into South32 in early 2015. That means it's still only a couple of years removed from its last big makeover. That's not really enough time to assess if the new focus is working. And commodities are only just starting to show signs of strength, including oil, which has lifted off its lows of around $30 a barrel to hit the $50 area. It's also important to remember that the oil assets aren't exactly going anywhere. So BHP can spin them off at a later date just as well as it could spin them off today -- why rush into a new spin off so soon? Fine tuning the oil business seems like a more prudent move at this point. With BHP clearly willing to defend its position, I wouldn't expect much more than that for now. ","

    Buzz60 John Flannery will become CEO of GE on Aug. 1, 2017, replacing Jeff Immelt.(Photo: GE) John Flannery, the veteran General Electric executive who leads its healthcare unit, was a relatively newcomer to the speculative list of who would be the next CEO of the global conglomerate. But in naming the 55-year old executive as the replacement for GE CEO Jeff Immelt starting in August, GE turned to someone who is deeply familiar with the various parts of the complex company that is in the midst of tumultuous changes. Flannery joined GE in 1987, working as an analyst evaluating GE's risk in using debt to buy new businesses. He then took on a various finance-related jobs, including a stint as a leader in the corporate restructuring and workout group and business development. RELATED: GE CEO Jeff Immelt stepping down, John Flannery to take over role General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt: We're seeing 'end of the global elite' GE profit falls, but 'more optimistic' as Trump arrives A year after Immelt took over as CEO in 2001, he dispatched Flannery to head other positions where he's had to repeatedly prove and display his investment acumen. Flannery took over as the chief of GE's private equity group and was given expanded roles in the financial services unit, GE Capital, which was eventually sold. Starting 2005, he led the Asia Pacific region for GE Capital. During his tenure in Asia, GE Capital's profit in Japan doubled and grew 35% in Korea. Four years later, he moved to India, a key emerging market where he focused on growing its industrial business. Flannery's assignment to India was partly made to see what ""he can do globally"" and Immelt was impressed by his ability to expand local business contacts quickly, Immelt said. With a majority of GE's revenue now coming from abroad, Flannery's global exposure ultimately gave him an edge in winning the CEO job, Immelt said. ""I've had opportunity to see John do five jobs,"" Immelt said during an employee meeting Monday, adding Flannery also had once been in his ""doghouse."" ""He’s the perfect person to run this company,"" Immelt said. After returning to the U.S., Flannery moved up quickly on the business development side, tasked with how best to invest GE's funds. In 2015, he led the $10 billion acquisition of Alstom, the largest industrial acquisition in GE's history. He also was directly involved in shrinking or eliminating GE's financial services businesses, which Immelt identified as not being aligned with future growth opportunities. He soon took over GE Healthcare, an $18 billion business. Co-founded by inventor Thomas Edison, GE has a rich legacy of rigorous leadership and succession planning and has frequently touted its emphasis on spotting and nurturing management talent. And Immelt's ascension in 2001 came after a heated internal competition closely monitored by his predecessor, Jack Welch. Flannery was something of a dark horse candidate. Even as Flannery led one of GE's largest business units, his name didn't rise immediately as a potential replacement for Immelt. GE CFO Jeff Bornstein, GE Power division chief Steve Bolze and GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli were frequently mentioned as possible candidates. But Flannery began to emerge quickly in recent months among company watchers, said Gautam Khanna, an industry analyst at financial services firm Cowen. The process of selecting the new CEO was noticeably more muted this time around than 16 years ago, noted Michael Useem, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""By having it more muted and more inside-ballpark, the directors and Immelt can do a better job vetting the candidates. Having a public bake-off...becomes a spectacle,"" he said. In a conference call, Flannery told investors that he will focus on comprehensively reviewing the company's assets in the next few weeks before revealing his strategy in September. But ""cost structure and cash flow"" are among the areas he's looking to focus on, he said. GE has undergone painful rounds of cost-cutting, shedding about $7 billion in costs in recent years. ""I'd suspect there is some incremental costs to cut,"" Khanna said. ""He may also look harder at spending on the digital side."" Flannery, whose dog is named ""Mookie"" (after Boston Red Sox player Mookie Betts), plans to move to Boston to work from GE's headquarters. He graduated from Fairfield University in Connecticut and earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Follow USA TODAY reporter Roger Yu on Twitter @ByRogerYu.

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Friday it and partners would spend $4.4 billion to develop part of the Liza oilfield off the coast of Guyana, approving a megaproject at a time when the oil industry has grown obsessed with lower-cost shale. Exxon’s decision shows that oil companies remain interested in large projects, especially offshore, even in an era of belt-tightening after two years of low crude prices. The Guyana announcement from Exxon and partners Hess Corp and CNOOC was the fifth deepwater project to gain approvals this year. BP Plc  and Reliance Industries said on Thursday they would spend $6 billion to develop natural gas reserves off the Indian coast. Exxon, which spent nearly $7 billion earlier this year to more than double its holdings in the Permian shale formation in the United States, said the Guyana project was approved due in part to its low cost of production. “We’re excited about the tremendous potential of the Liza field and accelerating first production through a phased development in this lower cost environment,” Liam Mallon, Exxon’s head of development, said in a statement. Phase One of the Liza development project should tap about 450 million barrels of oil and pump about 120,000 barrels per day when it comes online in 2020, Exxon said in a statement. The Liza field is roughly 190 kilometers off the coast of Guyana. Exxon plans 17 wells as part of the project’s first phase. A second phase is possible in the future, the company said. New York-based Hess said it expects its share of the project’s cost to be about $955 million. Shares of Exxon rose 0.7 percent to $82.97 on Friday. ","

,06222017,Reuters,06152017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Synthetic Genomics Inc said on Monday they had found a way to more than double the amount of lipids produced by algae in a lab, moving a potential alternative to fossil fuels closer to commercial viability. The development comes as Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, fights accusations by environmentalists and others that it misled investors and the public for years about the risks of climate change from fossil fuels. In the past decade, Exxon has boosted investment in fuel cells, biodiesel, algae and other alternative energy technologies, in collaboration with private partners. The company also has invested in television advertisements to tout its renewable energy investments, including during last summer’s Olympic Games. “Algae can be a viable, renewable source for volumes of oil at scale,” said Vijay Swarup, Exxon’s vice president for research and development. “We like algae because it’s fast-growing, doesn’t compete for food and water and can grow in all sorts of climates and brackish water.” Exxon and Synthetic cautioned that they are far from being able to run the process at commercial scale. The oil company’s ultimate goal is to make an oil from algae that can be processed by existing refineries, though that goal remains elusive. Exxon began working with California-based Synthetic on algae research in 2009. The lab work is conducted at Synthetic facilities and funded by Exxon, which declined to disclose its financial investment. Scientists studied the way that algae cells partition carbon - typically from carbon dioxide - and produce lipids, a kind of hydrocarbon. Algae converts carbon dioxide into lipids much in the same way the human body converts sugar into fat. The scientists were able to genetically modify algae to convert 40 percent of CO2 into lipids, up from a prior 15 percent. “This was not an overnight breakthrough. This was a lot of sweat and toil,” said Craig Venter, chairman of Synthetic Genomics. Up next, scientists will need to unlock how to speed up the process and strengthen the algae cells. “This just gives us hope and optimism that we’re on the right track,” said Swarup. ","

Tom DiChristopher,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Pittsburgh-based EQT Corp. is poised to become the largest producer of natural gas in the United States after announcing it will acquire fellow shale driller Rice Energy. EQT announced on Monday it will buy all of Rice Energy's shares in a deal worth $6.7 billion. After closing, EQT's output will total 3.6 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, topping U.S. production by oil major Exxon Mobil and shale drilling pioneer Chesapeake Energy. Shares of EQT Corp. were down about 9 percent to $53.51 on Monday. Rice Energy's stock price soared nearly 25 percent to $24.57 a share. The acquisition extends EQT's footprint in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. The area underlying Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia is the epicenter of a boom in American natural gas produced through hydraulic fracturing, the process of injecting water, minerals and chemicals underground to free oil and gas from rock formations. ""This transaction brings together two of the top Marcellus and Utica producers to form a natural gas operating position that will be unmatched in the industry,"" EQT President and CEO Steve Schlotterbeck said in a statement. EQT expects the deal to close in the final quarter of this year. Most of the acreage EQT will acquire from Rice is contiguous to its existing holdings, so it will be able to produce more efficiently through horizontal drilling, the company said. This means EQT needs to drill fewer vertical wells because it can drill sideways into neighboring pockets of natural gas. EQT appears to be ""empire building,"" and it's unlikely another driller will submit a successful bid for Rice, according to Mizuho Securities. That is because EQT's footprint overlaps with Rice's in southwestern Pennsylvania and the two companies have similar midstream operations, which focus on transporting natural gas through the Appalachian region, according to Mizuho. As part of the deal, EQT will acquire Rice's 92 percent interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings. EQT already owns a 90 percent limited partner interest in EQT GP Holdings, which also operates transportation infrastructure through EQT Midstream Partners.

Jim Pavia,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Did you know that a former CEO of ExxonMobil is fourth in the U.S. presidential line of succession? Or that Ben Carson — neurosurgeon, controversial former presidential candidate and now secretary of Housing and Urban Development — stands 13th in line to replace President Donald Trump if he dies, resigns or is removed from office? The transportation secretary is 14th in line, but since Elaine Chao is a naturalized U.S. citizen — not born in the United States — she is ineligible. Amid the continuing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, there, of course, has been a great deal of discussion and news coverage of the 45th commander in chief not completing his full term in office. If a sitting president leaves office, the vice president — currently Mike Pence — becomes president for the rest of the term. If he is unable to serve, the next person in the line of succession acts as president (see the chart below). To date, only a vice president has ever replaced the president. The second in line, after Pence, is House Speaker Paul Ryan. And that oilman, who would follow Ryan and then Senate President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch, into the West Wing? That would be Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. American presidential succession laws date to 1792. The line of succession has been shuffled several times, including in 1868, when Congress removed the leaders of the Senate and House from the list, and, most recently, in 1967. Several of the countries want to avoid regulatory hurdles that come with dealing with the U.S., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Sources told NBC News that local police officers detained him after responding to an incident involving Avenatti in west Los Angeles. On Tuesday, Kudlow slammed Navarro for his remarks on the White House's ongoing trade negotiations with China.

Reuben Gregg Brewer,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. International oil major Eni SpA (NYSE:E) has a huge 8.4% dividend yield, more than double ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield. But that fat yield doesn't make Eni the better dividend stock. To be fair, there are reasons to like Eni beyond the dividend yield, including the huge opportunities presented by its Zohr project in Egypt and its Mozambique natural gas fields. But despite some positives, here are three reasons why ExxonMobil is a better choice for dividend investors than higher yielding Eni. At the end of the first quarter long-term debt made up 28% of Eni's capital structure. That's not an unreasonable level of debt by any means. However, Eni's core business is selling a commodity subject to often large and sudden price swings. Which is exactly what happened in mid-2014 when oil fell from over $100 a barrel to the $30 a barrel area at the worst of the decline. Oil prices have moved higher since that point, hovering in the $40 to $50 per barrel range lately, but it's still well off its highs. Image source: Getty Images. Exxon's long-term debt makes up just 12% of its capital structure. That gives the oil giant a material amount of flexibility that Eni just doesn't have. In fact, Exxon has made extensive use of its balance sheet strength during the downturn to support its business and dividend.  At the start of 2014, long-term debt was roughly 5% of the capital structure. Eni's long-term debt, for comparison, was around 26% of its capital structure at the start of 2014... Clearly Eni didn't have the same capacity to support its business with debt, and still doesn't. Which helps explain why Eni sold a stake in its Mozambique gas field to Exxon. And why it partnered up with BP on the Zohr project. Basically, you can get a piece of Eni's high profile projects without buying Eni and it's heavy debt load. In my opinion, Exxon's solid balance sheet is the better option. The next reason to prefer Exxon over Eni is the basic business of each company. Exxon is a truly integrated oil major, with oil and natural gas drilling balanced against its chemicals and refining assets. To highlight the benefit of this, Exxon's earnings after income taxes fell by roughly 50% in 2015, a really bad year for all oil companies. But earnings at its chemicals business were up slightly year over year and its downstream earnings more than doubled, as refining benefited from falling oil prices. That helped offset the massive 75% drop in earnings from its upstream oil and gas drilling business. In fact, the downstream business earned almost as much on an absolute basis as the upstream business that year. This balanced approach allowed Exxon to report a profit for the full year. Now compare that to Eni, which has a diversified business but is more heavily weighted toward exploration and production. Adjusted net profit in 2015 fell a massive 90%, with asset write downs pushing the company's earnings deep into the red. It simply didn't have the balance to offset the decline on the oil and natural gas side of the business. To give you an idea of the scale of the problem, in 2015 adjusted earnings in the downstream business totaled 387 million euro compared to the 4.1 billion euro provided by the upstream segment. In other words, when Eni needed diversification its downstream business was little more than a rounding error. I'll take Exxon's truly diversified business, thanks. If Eni's big yield attracted you to the name, then step back and take a look at the company's dividend history. Between 2014 and 2015 it cut the dividend roughly 30%. Essentially, at the first sign of trouble shareholders took a dividend haircut. When you look at Eni's leverage relative to Exxon and the relative lack of diversification in its business you can see why that decision was made. And it was probably the right move for the company. However, if you were relying on those dividend checks, the cut would have hurt. At this point you shouldn't look at Eni's dividend as secure in any environment. (Note that currency fluctuations have recently pushed Eni's dividend even lower in dollar terms, in euros it has remained at the same level since the cut.) E Dividend Per Share (Annual) data by YCharts. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, used its balance sheet strength and truly diversified business model to keep rewarding investors with annual dividend increases each year through the downturn. The company's annual streak is now up to 35 consecutive years, making Exxon a dividend aristocrat. Recent hikes have been more modest than historical increases, but that's to be expected in a difficult industry environment. The real point is that Exxon wins hands down compared to Eni when it comes to returning value to shareholders via a consistently growing dividend. Eni offers investors a massive yield right now. But once you look past that, the positives at the oil giant just don't offset the negatives. Eni has less financial flexibility than Exxon, a less than inspiring dividend track record on an absolute and relative basis, and it lacks the diversification that Exxon's business offers -- a difference that showed up notably in 2015 when Eni chose to trim its dividend. Exxon has proven its dividend commitment for 35 consecutive years and despite the relatively low yield, I'd rather own Exxon than Eni any day. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Investors are slowly starting to push companies to reduce their carbon footprint and help the world meet targets on limiting global warming that were agreed in the 2015 Paris climate talks. Energy firms have faced shareholder demands to do more to curb carbon emissions, while some pension funds are demanding more commitment to climate goals from firms they invest in. Yet progress has still been modest since the Paris deal agreed by almost 200 nations came into force in November last year, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. “Lots of investors are looking to align their investments with a 2 degrees world. It’s just at what pace they all get there,” said Fiona Reynolds, managing director at the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Advocates of the climate deal hope new impetus will come from Thursday’s document published by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a group set up by G20 nations. The task force’s document outlines a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, drawing support from more than 100 companies with $11 trillion of assets. It aims to help investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders understand how firms manage climate risk and guide companies on information they should provide to explain their climate strategy, ultimately helping ensure corporate laggards are held to account. “The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement,” said Philippe Desfossés, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP. Sweden’s largest national pension fund AP7 set a high benchmark in June when it named six companies it said had breached the Paris accord, and ditched them from its portfolio. Several energy firms have faced shareholder rebellions at annual general meetings over their stance on climate change. ExxonMobil XON.N has been accused of misleading investors by a U.S. prosecutor, allegations the U.S. firm has dismissed as “frivolous”. Many energy firms have been sharing more information on their climate strategies, and some mining companies are starting to follow suit, such as iron ore miner Vale VALE5.SA. In a Reuters survey, 13 leading public and corporate pension schemes in Europe, Asia and North America managing a total $1.1 trillion said they were committed to engaging firms on their climate strategy. Three of those funds said explicitly that divestment was an option if talks were unsatisfactory. However, some funds said the threat of divestment was not the best approach to encouraging firms to improve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. “We think engagement investment is about promoting companies to be involved with ESG through engagement,” said Hiroichi Yagi, an adviser to the pension fund of Japan’s Secom, a leading security firm. “If you just sell and stop investing in companies that are not mindful of climate change, then you are abandoning engagement there,” he said, adding that he was not aware of any Japanese pension funds advocating divestment as an option. To date, most divestments have tended to be from companies mining coal, the dirtiest energy source. Some large investors, such as Norway’s $960-billion sovereign wealth fund, have set limits on how much revenues can come from that source. The most active asset owners on climate change have tended to be big pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds - Norway’s and New Zealand’s have reduced exposure to fossil fuels. Such firms have more in-house analysts to assess investments. Smaller funds are making slower progress in pushing climate issues up the agenda in determining investment policy. A survey by consultants Mercer of 1,241 European pension schemes, half of which had less than 100 million euros ($114 million) in assets, showed just 5 percent considered the financial impact of climate change on their portfolios. However, that was up from 4 percent a year earlier. “It’s ironic that the pace of response to this enormous issue is best described as glacial, outside a small group of leading funds,” said Phil Edwards, Mercer’s Global Director of Strategic Research, calling for more “urgency” to be applied. Advocates of the Paris accord hope the TFCD’s framework document will particularly assist smaller firms. Britain’s Environment Agency Protection Fund, a founder member of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) that aims to help asset owners assess firms, said more than 3 trillion pounds  ($3.9 trillion) of assets were now being invested using the TPI’s guidelines. “We are aiming to be one of the first asset owners to do this to show our support for the TCFD and its pick up by other asset owners,” said Faith Ward, the scheme’s chief responsible investment officer. She said her fund planned to link its annual report to the TCFD framework. ","

Rakesh Sharma,06292017,Investopedia,06222017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs That is one big bite of Apple Inc. (AAPL). According to Calcbench, a research firm that analyzes financial data from the SEC, Apple has averaged $107.1 million in share repurchases daily since initiating its stock buyback program in August 2012. In sum, this means that the company has purchased $142 billion worth of its own stock during that period. For context, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), which is the second biggest purchaser of its own stock, averaged $42.4 million of stock repurchases per day and spent a total of $55.88 billion for the initiative between 2012 and 2017. In its latest earnings report, Apple announced that it had spent $151 billion on stock repurchases since August 2012. Its pace of buybacks has accelerated since 2015, when it had purchased $80 billion worth of its own stock from shareholders. Apple also announced during its latest earnings call that it was planning to increase its share repurchase program to $210 billion from the year-ago level of $175 billion. (See also: Why Would a Company Buy Back Its Own Shares?) The Cupertino, California-based company's stock price has appreciated by 68% from 2012 to 2017, after adjusting for a stock split that occurred in 2014. Share repurchases increase the value of outstanding shares because the total number of shares available decreases even as their price remains the same. For example, Apple had 6.6 billion of its shares trading in the markets in 2013. As of this May, that number is down to 5.2 billion. According to some estimates, the decline in the number of shares has translated to a 21% bump in earnings per share for the company. (For more on Apple's history of stock splits, check out: If You Had Invested Right After Apple's IPO.) Much of Apple's share repurchase program is financed from its overseas cash pile. Of the company's $250 billion in cash, 90% is estimated to be parked abroad. In recent times, criticism has mounted against the company for failing to make acquisitions of innovative startups or invest in improving its innovation track record through the use of its cash. Critics have charged the company with ""financial engineering"" through stock buybacks to boost its bottom line, especially in the face of declining enthusiasm for its iconic iPhone.

"Scott Stringer, Comptroller of New York City",06292017,CNBC,06222017,"At the upcoming G20 summit, world leaders will have their work cut out for them. But one topic is particularly primed for action: climate change. With President Trump withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever that the G20 take action to fight climate change. Because at the end of the day, this is a global crisis — and it demands a global solution. If the White House won't lead on the climate it's going to be up to the rest of the world to do just that. The G20 has an important role to play — from continuing to support and implement the Paris Agreement, to driving investment in the low-carbon economy, to improving corporate disclosure of climate change related risks. That last step — climate change risk disclosure — may not sound Earth-shattering, but it can play a crucial role in the fight against global warming. Right now, however, most companies have stayed silent and refused to take that step. But as anyone in the business world knows, when there's more information, markets work better. And ultimately, outcomes improve. That means transparency yields stronger investments and helps us create a greener planet. It's not a market standard today — but the G20 could change that soon. This week, the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures — formed in 2015 at the request of the G20 to study this issue — will release its recommendations, which will be presented to the full G20 in July. The recommendations will cover everything from board oversight of climate issues — which we at the New York City Pension Funds have focused on for years — to standardizing the metrics used to manage climate issues. Perhaps most important, the task force will encourage every company to disclose how their businesses, strategies, and financial planning would fare in world where warming is limited to 2-degrees Celsius or less. This process — known as ""scenario analysis"" — is a  key step to understanding how transitioning to a low-carbon world would impact a company's long-term financial health. In other words, when it comes to transparency about climate change, the G20 meeting in Hamburg could be the dawn of a new era. For decades, institutional investors have pushed companies to recalibrate their strategies and prepare for a low-carbon world. The New York City Pension Funds have worked with groups like the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk and Sustainability — a coalition of 130 members who collectively manage over $17 trillion in assets — to make a difference. And this year marked a historic shift. Resolutions calling on  ExxonMobil and  Occidental Petroleum to analyze what a low-carbon future means for them received unprecedented majority investor support. I'm proud that the New York City Pension Funds co-filed these resolutions — and also supported a similar resolution which passed at electric utility PPL Corporation. Across the business world, leaders are coalescing around these climate change disclosures. Consulting firms McKinsey and Deloitte — along with credit ratings company Moody's — have publicly endorsed them. Large asset managers like BlackRock are on board. And CEOs of dozens of companies have  urged G20 governments to formally accept the task force's recommendations. These are all steps in the right direction — but given the link between task force's recommendations and avoiding the dangers of climate change, we must do more. With the release of the recommendations and the G20 meeting approaching, there's a chance for scenario analysis and climate change disclosure to take a leap toward becoming a market standard. That means more corporate and investor voices are needed. With more than 2,000 companies, investors, universities, states and cities that have pledged to continue to support climate action, now we all need to stand up for corporate transparency, forward-thinking planning, and a greener planet. When it comes to climate change disclosure, we need to  stand together and be visionaries. This isn't disclosure for disclosure's sake. It's about protecting our investments — and our planet — for generations to come.

Reuben Gregg Brewer,06292017,Fool,06222017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. International oil major Eni SpA (NYSE:E) has a huge 8.4% dividend yield, more than double ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield. But that fat yield doesn't make Eni the better dividend stock. To be fair, there are reasons to like Eni beyond the dividend yield, including the huge opportunities presented by its Zohr project in Egypt and its Mozambique natural gas fields. But despite some positives, here are three reasons why ExxonMobil is a better choice for dividend investors than higher yielding Eni. At the end of the first quarter long-term debt made up 28% of Eni's capital structure. That's not an unreasonable level of debt by any means. However, Eni's core business is selling a commodity subject to often large and sudden price swings. Which is exactly what happened in mid-2014 when oil fell from over $100 a barrel to the $30 a barrel area at the worst of the decline. Oil prices have moved higher since that point, hovering in the $40 to $50 per barrel range lately, but it's still well off its highs. Image source: Getty Images. Exxon's long-term debt makes up just 12% of its capital structure. That gives the oil giant a material amount of flexibility that Eni just doesn't have. In fact, Exxon has made extensive use of its balance sheet strength during the downturn to support its business and dividend.  At the start of 2014, long-term debt was roughly 5% of the capital structure. Eni's long-term debt, for comparison, was around 26% of its capital structure at the start of 2014... Clearly Eni didn't have the same capacity to support its business with debt, and still doesn't. Which helps explain why Eni sold a stake in its Mozambique gas field to Exxon. And why it partnered up with BP on the Zohr project. Basically, you can get a piece of Eni's high profile projects without buying Eni and it's heavy debt load. In my opinion, Exxon's solid balance sheet is the better option. The next reason to prefer Exxon over Eni is the basic business of each company. Exxon is a truly integrated oil major, with oil and natural gas drilling balanced against its chemicals and refining assets. To highlight the benefit of this, Exxon's earnings after income taxes fell by roughly 50% in 2015, a really bad year for all oil companies. But earnings at its chemicals business were up slightly year over year and its downstream earnings more than doubled, as refining benefited from falling oil prices. That helped offset the massive 75% drop in earnings from its upstream oil and gas drilling business. In fact, the downstream business earned almost as much on an absolute basis as the upstream business that year. This balanced approach allowed Exxon to report a profit for the full year. Now compare that to Eni, which has a diversified business but is more heavily weighted toward exploration and production. Adjusted net profit in 2015 fell a massive 90%, with asset write downs pushing the company's earnings deep into the red. It simply didn't have the balance to offset the decline on the oil and natural gas side of the business. To give you an idea of the scale of the problem, in 2015 adjusted earnings in the downstream business totaled 387 million euro compared to the 4.1 billion euro provided by the upstream segment. In other words, when Eni needed diversification its downstream business was little more than a rounding error. I'll take Exxon's truly diversified business, thanks. If Eni's big yield attracted you to the name, then step back and take a look at the company's dividend history. Between 2014 and 2015 it cut the dividend roughly 30%. Essentially, at the first sign of trouble shareholders took a dividend haircut. When you look at Eni's leverage relative to Exxon and the relative lack of diversification in its business you can see why that decision was made. And it was probably the right move for the company. However, if you were relying on those dividend checks, the cut would have hurt. At this point you shouldn't look at Eni's dividend as secure in any environment. (Note that currency fluctuations have recently pushed Eni's dividend even lower in dollar terms, in euros it has remained at the same level since the cut.) E Dividend Per Share (Annual) data by YCharts. ExxonMobil, on the other hand, used its balance sheet strength and truly diversified business model to keep rewarding investors with annual dividend increases each year through the downturn. The company's annual streak is now up to 35 consecutive years, making Exxon a dividend aristocrat. Recent hikes have been more modest than historical increases, but that's to be expected in a difficult industry environment. The real point is that Exxon wins hands down compared to Eni when it comes to returning value to shareholders via a consistently growing dividend. Eni offers investors a massive yield right now. But once you look past that, the positives at the oil giant just don't offset the negatives. Eni has less financial flexibility than Exxon, a less than inspiring dividend track record on an absolute and relative basis, and it lacks the diversification that Exxon's business offers -- a difference that showed up notably in 2015 when Eni chose to trim its dividend. Exxon has proven its dividend commitment for 35 consecutive years and despite the relatively low yield, I'd rather own Exxon than Eni any day. ","

                                   Rumors involved Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP as buyers surfaced. There seemed to be a very nice fit given the mass of reserves of Chesapeake Energy, and the price of oil and natural gas at the time obviously helped valuation calculations. But everything changed when oil prices collapsed in 2014. Suddenly, instead of appearing to be a takeover target, Chesapeake Energy was trying desperately to produce profitably and to even survive. Just one a year ago, it appeared to be on the verge of bankruptcy. Since then, however, Chesapeake and the rest of the industry has figured out how to produce oil at lower costs and are once again competitive. This has been frustrating to OPEC, which is attempting to stabilize oil prices through production cuts. On Monday, Chesapeake Energy’s president told a J.P. Morgan Chase conference that “the financial strength of the company ... is better than it’s ever been before.” In that case, maybe Chesapeake Energy should go back on lists of potential buyout targets. Based on proven reserves and current oil prices, Chesapeake Energy has assets totaling over $80 billion, and its stock-market value is just $4.33 billion. There’s also approximately $9 billion in debt. So any buyout today likely would cost roughly $15 billion. When looking at the proven reserves vs. the cost of an acquisition, the general numbers start to look attractive. But that’s not the whole picture. For three consecutive quarters, Chesapeake Energy has produced positive earnings, with first-quarter earnings hitting 23 cents a share, up from 7 cents in the previous quarter. Analysts are currently expecting the company to earn approximately 85 cents per share this year, and $1.09 per share next year. That means the shares are trading near 4.4 times 2018 earnings. Granted, the past lingers for any company that was on the verge of bankruptcy as recently as a year ago. For any potential suitor, however, knowing that the company is in good financial condition is reason enough to open their eyes. Given the valuation metrics that currently exist, and assuming that the company is in as good a financial condition as expressed on Monday, what until recently was an ugly duckling may suddenly be appealing to any large industry player looking to acquire a shale producer on the cheap.
