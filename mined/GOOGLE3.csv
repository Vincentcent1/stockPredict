,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties — like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play — are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”—separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily—continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” ","

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"Google announced a deal with Yandex and Russia’s competition watchdog on April 17, pledging to stop requiring manufacturers of Android-based devices to pre-install its search engine and other applications. Yandex expects the settlement to “open the door to market share gains on mobile (devices) in 2017 and beyond,” Chief Executive Arkady Volozh said in a statement. Yandex is the largest internet search engine in Russia, but has struggled to increase its share of this market on mobile devices, most of which use Android. The company’s overall share of the Russian search market, including mobile, was flat quarter on quarter at 55.4 percent but down from 57.6 percent a year earlier. Yandex said on a conference call on Thursday that the Android case settlement’s impact on the company’s market share would be skewed to the second half of the year. The company now expects 2017 revenue growth of between 17 and 20 percent, having predicted in February a rise of 16-19 percent. First-quarter revenue jumped 25 percent. The company also said its cash pile stood at 61.4 billion roubles ($1.08 billion) as of March 31. Yandex said in February it did not rule out that its board of directors could discuss the possibility of a maiden dividend payout at one of its meetings this year. “Clearly we do see an increasing confidence about the overall economic backdrop,” Greg Abovsky, Yandex chief financial officer, told a conference call when asked about the prospect of a dividend payout. “We do believe that we are in a better position, we have a strong balance sheet and we’ve just hedged out two years worth of office lease expense so I think the board will feel more confident about making a cash distribution decision now than it has before,” Abovsky said. The company increased adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 19 percent in the first quarter to 6.9 billion roubles on 20.7 billion roubles of sales. Net income was down 23 percent to 0.8 billion roubles due to a 2.2 billion rouble foreign exchange loss, while adjusted net income rose 18 percent to 3.7 billion roubles. It said online advertising revenues grew 23 percent, adding that its online taxi booking service was a major growth driver with sales up 75 percent. Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up 5.8 percent in early trade on Thursday at $26.30. ($1 = 57.0386 roubles) ","

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"The proliferation of hate speech and fake news on social media has led to companies coming under increased pressure to take it down quickly. In a draft policy paper, the European Commission says there is a “high degree of variation in the approaches taken to removal of illegal content - be it incitement to terrorism, hate speech, child sexual abuse material, or infringements of intellectual property rights”. “Such divergences may be justified in some cases (e.g. for certain types of illegal content); but in other cases they reduce the effectiveness of the system (e.g. by delaying the removal of terrorist propaganda).” The Commission says it may come forward with legislative and/or non-legislative instruments by the end of the year to address “legal fragmentation and uncertainty related to the removal of illegal content by online platforms”. Germany last month unveiled a law which would fine social media companies up to 50 million euros ($53.62 million) if they fail to remove hate postings quickly, prompting concerns it could threaten free speech. Companies say they are in a difficult position as they are not liable for content posted on their platforms and not required to actively monitor what goes up. However, they do have to take down illegal content when notified. The paper, which is a mid-term review of the Commission’s strategy to create a digital single market in Europe, says the EU executive is exploring options to clarify the role of online platforms without impinging on the liability exemption. “The Commission considers that a more transparent and predictable environment would create incentives for platforms to adopt proactive measures to maintain a healthy online ecosystem.” An EU official said the Commission was considering adopting a so-called “good Samaritan” principle whereby online platforms would not be held liable for content if they actively searched for illegal content on their websites, hoping this would make companies more proactive. The mid-term review should be adopted in May. ","

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam’s government said Facebook has committed to work with it to prevent content that violates the country’s laws from appearing on its platform. In February, communist Vietnam complained about “toxic” anti-government and offensive content on Facebook and Google Inc.’s YouTube and pressured local companies to withdraw advertising until the social media firms found a solution. Facebook’s commitment came during a meeting between its Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert and Vietnamese information and communication minister Truong Minh Tuan in Hanoi on Wednesday, a statement on the government’s website said. “Facebook will set up a separate channel to directly coordinate with Vietnam’s communication and information ministry to prioritize requests from the ministry and other competent authorities in the country,” the statement said. The firm will also remove fake accounts and fake content about senior government officials, it said. A Facebook representative said the company had a clear and consistent process for governments to report illegal content. “We review all these requests against our terms of service and applicable law. We are transparent about the requests we receive from government and content we restrict pursuant with local law in our Global Government Requests Report,” the representative said in an emailed statement. The report shows no content restricted at the request of Vietnam’s government between July 2015 and June 2016, the latest period for which Facebook has published data. Vietnam’s government tolerates little dissent and human rights groups and western countries have criticized its arrest of anti-government bloggers. While Vietnam makes up a very small part of the business operations of companies like Google and Facebook, it is one of Asia’s fastest growing economies and a hot investment target for global consumer brands. Within Vietnam itself, YouTube and Facebook account for two-thirds of digital media market share in Vietnam, according to local agency Isobar Vietnam. Facebook has faced an unrelated challenge this week in nearby Thailand, where a man broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter in a live video on Facebook that stayed on the platform for 24 hours before being removed.

Revenue rose 17 percent to $2.98 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $2.94 billion. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said the company was planning some staff cuts and other restructuring initiatives which will slash $75 million in annual costs. “Less than 3 percent of our global workforce will be affected and based on current plans, we do not expect a net decrease in headcount for the year,” Rainey said. PayPal’s shares jumped 6 percent to $47.08 in after-hours trading.

Rainey said growth in revenue had been driven by an increase in payments processing volumes in both its core business and other services such payments platform provider BrainTree. PayPal’s total payments volume jumped 22.5 percent to $99.33 billion, beating research firm FactSet StreetAccount’s estimate of $99.20 billion.

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U.S. companies operating in Southeast Asia’s largest economy, visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta’s investment chief said. The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties. “We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access,” Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo. “The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully,” Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour. Indonesia’s investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said. Indonesia’s Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed “we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries”. “I’m optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment,” Lembong told Reuters. “I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength.” Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, “especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports.” Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late. Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday. “We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia,” Pence said, adding the agreements would “draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people.” COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism. “The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples,” Pence said. A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State. Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia’s largest, and said Indonesia’s moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations. Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration’s proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts. Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines. ","

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget about French elections or the flagging Trump trade. Corporate America is set to unleash its biggest profit-reporting fest in at least a decade next week, with more than 190 members of the S&P 500 index .SPX delivering quarterly scorecards, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The onslaught could keep U.S. stock investors’ focus largely on earnings next week even as the world’s attention is likely to be drawn elsewhere. “That would be our hope,” said Joe Zidle, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. “A lot of people looked at this market and said it was the result of the Trump bump or the Hillary relief rally,” while earnings have been rebounding, he said. “The faster earnings growth is underappreciated by investors.” Many strategists have attributed the 10 percent rally in the S&P 500 .INX since Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election to optimism Trump would boost the domestic economy through tax cuts and an infrastructure spending binge. The gains drove market valuations recently to their highest since 2004, even with little progress in Washington on the fiscal policy front. Meanwhile, other anxiety-provoking events have grabbed headlines, including unsettling relations with North Korea and this weekend’s election in France, which has a bearing on the country’s membership in the European Union and its currency, the euro. Expectations for the quarter’s profit growth have risen as well, and the first three months of the year now appear set to mark the strongest quarterly earnings growth in more than five years. In the last week alone, expected S&P 500 first-quarter earnings per share growth rose to 11.2 percent from 10.4 percent, a more than 7 percent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data. “This week definitely has proven that the Street likes earnings - it’s controllable, it’s U.S.,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The reason for the slew of reports next week is anyone’s guess, Silverblatt said, although recent holidays possibly played a role. Passover, Good Friday and Easter all fell in the previous weeks, which may have prompted some companies that typically report earlier to delay a week. Just 76 companies reported this week compared with 134 in the comparable week a year ago, Silverblatt said. Next week’s rush will represent a 15 percent increase from the 166 S&P constituents that reported in the comparable week last year. That could make for a bang in the market on Friday, Silverblatt said, which is also the final trading day of April. ","

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"SINAGPORE (Reuters) - Companies from Singapore to Finland are racing to improve artificial intelligence so software can automatically spot and block videos of grisly murders and mayhem before they go viral on social media. None, so far, claim to have cracked the problem completely. A Thai man who broadcast himself killing his 11-month-old daughter in a live video on Facebook this week, was the latest in a string of violent crimes shown live on the social media company. The incidents have prompted questions about how Facebook’s reporting system works and how violent content can be flagged faster. A dozen or more companies are wrestling with the problem, those in the industry say. Google - which faces similar problems with its YouTube service - and Facebook are working on their own solutions. Most are focusing on deep learning: a type of artificial intelligence that makes use of computerized neural networks. It is an approach that David Lissmyr, founder of Paris-based image and video analysis company Sightengine, says goes back to efforts in the 1950s to mimic the way neurons work and interact in the brain. Teaching computers to learn with deep layers of artificial neurons has really only taken off in the past few years, said Matt Zeiler, founder and CEO of New York-based Clarifai, another video analysis company. It’s only been relatively recently that there has been enough computing power and data available for teaching these systems, enabling “exponential leaps in the accuracy and efficacy of machine learning”, Zeiler said. The teaching system begins with images fed through the computer’s neural layers, which then “learn” to identify a street sign, say, or a violent scene in a video. Violent acts might include hacking actions, or blood, says Abhijit Shanbhag, CEO of Singapore-based Graymatics. If his engineers can’t find a suitable scene, they film it themselves in the office. Zeiler says Clarifai’s algorithms can also recognize objects in a video that could be precursors to violence — a knife or gun, for instance. But there are limits. One is the software is only as good as the examples it is trained on. When someone decides to hang a child from a building, it’s not necessarily something the software has been programmed to watch for. “As people get more innovative about such gruesome activity, the system needs to be trained on that,” said Shanbhag, whose company filters video and image content on behalf of several social media clients in Asia and elsewhere. Another limitation is that violence can be subjective. A fast-moving scene with lots of gore should be easy enough to spot, says Junle Wang, head of R&D at France-based PicPurify. But the company is still working on identifying violent scenes that don’t involve blood or weapons. Psychological torture, too, is hard to spot, says his colleague, CEO Yann Mareschal. And then there’s content that could be deemed offensive without being intrinsically violent — an ISIS flag, for example — says Graymatics’s Shanbhag. That could require the system to be tweaked depending on the client. Yet another limitation is that while automation may help, humans must still be involved to verify the authenticity of content that has been flagged as offensive or dangerous, said Mika Rautiainen, founder and CEO of Valossa, a Finnish company which finds undesirable content for media, entertainment and advertising companies. Indeed, likely solutions would involve looking beyond the images themselves to incorporate other cues. PicPurify’s Wang says using algorithms to monitor the reaction of viewers — a sharp increase in reposts of a video, for example — might be an indicator. Michael Pogrebnyak, CEO of Kuznech, said his Russian-U.S. company has added to its arsenal of pornographic image-spotting algorithms - which mostly focus on skin detection and camera motion — to include others that detect the logos of studios and warning text screens. Facebook says it is using similar techniques to spot nudity, violence or other topics that don’t comply with its policies. A spokesperson didn’t respond to questions about whether the software was used in the Thai and other recent cases. Some of the companies said industry adoption was slower than it could be, in part because of the added expense. That, they say, will change. Companies that manage user-generated content could increasingly come under regulatory pressure, says Valossa’s Rautiainen. “Even without tightening regulation, not being able to deliver proper curation will increasingly lead to negative effects in online brand identity,” Rautiainen says.

,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sex traffickers are growing more adept at using sophisticated technology to exploit people, especially tools to hide their identity and encrypt data, fanning an ongoing battle between online privacy and security, a conference heard on Tuesday. Websites, chat rooms and virtual currency all are used by traffickers to hunt for child victims and sell them, said Kevin Gutfleish, a specialist in violent crimes against children at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Traffickers advertise online, track victims by cellphones and use encrypted messaging systems to communicate with accomplices, experts say, fuelling debate between human rights advocates who value protection against authorities concerned that encryption hampers law enforcement and enables criminals. “It has in some cases very significantly adversely affected our ability to solve cases and to get justice for victims,” Cyrus Vance, New York County District Attorney, told Trust Conference/America Forum, a one-day Thomson Reuters Foundation event on the fight against slavery and trafficking. Tech giants Apple and Google have come under scrutiny after changing their operating systems in 2014 to encrypt users’ data by default which boosted privacy online but made it harder for law enforcement agencies to get information off smartphones. Facebook-owned messaging system WhatsApp last year turned on end-to-end encryption that protects messages. Due to such encryption, Vance said his investigators have more than 500 cells phones that contain potential evidence in criminal cases but are locked and inaccessible. He called on Congress to pass legislation balancing the interests of security, privacy, law enforcement, crime victims and technology companies. “We want our privacy, but we also want to make sure that where criminals are involved, there’s going to be a way to solve the crimes,” he said. But Human Rights Watch Executive Director Ken Roth said human rights groups value online privacy and encryption in protecting victims, and breaching that privacy wall would create a vulnerability that will be exploited by criminals. “Yes, there are a handful of crimes that are going to be solved ... but think about the crimes that are going to be committed,” he told the Trust Conference/America Forum. “There are reams of hackers out there, criminal and governmental,” Roth said. “And they’re going to win.” The FBI’s Gutfleish told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that traffickers are keeping up with technology - and exploiting it for their purposes. “They’re not opposed to using what’s available to them,” he said. A survey of more than 1,000 law enforcement officers conducted for the Department of Justice last year found more than a third said the technical sophistication and expertise of sex traffickers had increased in the last five years, Gutfleish said. In particular, they reported seeing an increase in the use of tools and services that protect identities such as proxy servers that can mask the source of communication and the FBI was keeping pace with this and also trying to benefit from this technology. “Sex traffickers are readily taking advantage of those technologies that are available to them .. You have a lot to lose when you’re exploiting children,” he said. ","

Daniel Liberto,04272017,Investopedia,04202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Alphabet Inc.'s Google (GOOG) is considering introducing an ad-blocking feature to its widely used Chrome internet browser in a bid to filter out commercial messages that hinder user web-surfing experiences. According to the Wall Street Journal, the ad-blocker, which is expected to be officially announced by Google in the next couple of weeks, is still in the development phase. Current details being mulled over include whether to block individual ads or all advertising that appears on offensive websites. The tool will reportedly be usable on desktop and mobile versions of Chrome and could be activated by default. The New-York-based newspaper added that Google is likely to consult with the Coalition for Better Ads to establish what type of external messages merit blocking. The industry group released a list of standards in March. In it, pop-up ads, auto-play video ads, prestitial ads with countdown timers and large sticky ads were identified as unacceptable. For mobile devices, it also outlawed flashing animated ads, full-screen scrollover ads and ads with a density greater than 30 percent. (See also: Are Adblockers Changing Internet Business Models?) Given Google’s reliance on advertising revenues — the company generated over $60 billion in revenue from online advertising last year — its decision to potentially block ads appears to be a strange move. It has also attracted some controversy, particularly as it would enable Google, whose Chrome browser is used by nearly 60 percent of the global population, to effectively control the market and cut off revenue from rivals. (See also: Google, Facebook Dominate Digital Ads in 2017.)  According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is building its own ad-blocker in an attempt to stop an increasing number of web users from installing tools offered by other companies. By providing its own solution, Google could, in theory, control which ads are blocked. Google has previously attracted criticism for paying the maker of Adblock Plus, one of the most popular ad-filtering brands, to not block advertisements on its website. However, if the company’s new tool abides by the standards introduced by the Coalition for Better Ads, it will effectively be forced to apply measures that do not necessarily favor its own advertising customers.

Prableen Bajpai,04272017,Investopedia,04202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Often dubbed as ‘silver to bitcoin’s gold’, Litecoin has been around for around six years. While Litecoin is broadly built on a structure similar to Bitcoin's​, it has a faster block generation rate and hence offers a faster transaction confirmation. While it witnessed a lifetime high of $50 in November 2013, it hasn't seen much activity in the past two years or so with its price hovering around $2-$5 range. However, the recent movement in its price has got cryptocurrency enthusiasts to take a second look at it? Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, a MIT graduate and former Google engineer. Litecoin is based on an open source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority and uses ""scrypt"" as a proof of work, which can be decoded with the help of CPUs of consumer grade. Its price has risen from approximately $4 to $13 during the past one month. The main reason behind the recent rally has been the rising support towards adopting Segregated Witness, or simply SegWit. Litecoin like Bitcoin has a block capacity of one megabyte (MB) that limits the transactions per block. As the network grows, this tends to slow down the confirmation of transactions. SegWit is thus a ‘scaling’ mechanism originally developed for bitcoin. The adoption of SegWit requires a network consensus which has hindered its upgrade in case of bitcoin. However, Litecoin is getting closer to SegWit upgrade amid growing consensus. SegWit activation threshold is at 75%. This is a positive development for Litecoin and a successful upgrade could possibility trigger the same for Bitcoin which currently has just about 33% pool support for SegWit. There are a couple of Litecoin Segregated Witness adoption trackers which show the adoption progress. Charlie Lee has been advocating for SegWit to activate on Litecoin as well as Bitcoin, he says, “Litecoin does not have a block size problem. That’s right, and SegWit is not just a block scaling solution. I would even say block scaling is just a side benefit of SegWit. The main fix is transaction malleability, which would allow Lightning Networks (LN) to be built on top of Litecoin. And there are a bunch nicer features of SegWit.” Amid Bitcoin’s scaling debate, the possibility of Litecoin upgrade portrays a positive picture for its price, and usability. In fact, the increase in the latter would possibility make the price rally more sustainable for Litecoin. Litecoin is currently ranks fourth among the 700 plus cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of $687.31 million.

Daniel Liberto,04272017,Investopedia,04202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Marissa Mayer’s disappointing reign as CEO of Yahoo (YHOO) is looking pretty rich for her. According to documents filed on Monday, Mayer will make $186 million once the internet company that she was criticized for running into the ground finally sells its core holdings to Verizon (VZ). The protracted $4.48 billion merger, which was delayed following a number of big security breaches, is expected to be completed in June. Security filings state that Mayer’s Yahoo stock, stock options and restricted stock units are worth up to $186 million, based on Monday’s share price of $48.15. That hefty payout, which will come on top of Mayer's regularly salary, bonuses and stock that she has already sold, will be rewarded to her if Yahoo shareholders vote to sell the company June 8. (See also: Verizon Finally Acquires Yahoo Core Operations.) Mayer, who joined Yahoo from Google (GOOG) five years ago to popular acclaim, has largely been criticized for failing to achieve her mandate to improve trading across the company’s core e-mail, news and search engine business. However, despite these troubles, the excitement generated by Verizon’s takeover offer, together with lucrative long-held investments in China e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA), helped to lift the company’s stock price substantially, fattening Mayer’s final payout. (See also: 3 Big Reasons Why Marissa Mayer's Hiring Is A Huge Win For Yahoo!) When Mayer first joined Yahoo she was tasked with restoring the once internet giant to greatness. Instead, she encountered a major hacking disaster, a prolonged trading downturn and criticism over her lavish spending and acquisition strategy — under her leadership Yahoo bought social networking platform Tumblr for $1.1 billion. She was the company's sixth CEO in five years when she took the top spot in 2012. These difficulties were among the main reasons why Verizon decided not to retain Mayer’s services when the long-awaited merger goes through. The wireless telecommunications specialist’s newly-formed Oath division plans, however, to welcome some her peers on board. Oath is being billed as a way for Verizon to bolster its presence in the fast-growing online advertising market, which is currently dominated by the likes of Facebook (FB) and Alphabet’s Google. (See also: Yahoo and AOL Will Form 'Oath'.)

(AMZN), which has been riding high through much of this year, was downgraded by research firm Raymond James to Market Perform from Outperform this morning. After a slight decline in its share price during morning trading, the Seattle company bounced back and ended the day at $907.02, almost unchanged from its start price. (For more, see also: Amazon Hits All-Time High as Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Market Cap.) In his note about Amazon, Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler stated that the company would need to show “greater operating leverage” in its business to move towards the firm’s previous price estimate of $925. Kessler did not provide a new price target in his note. He identified the firm’s international operations, shipping costs and Prime video as areas where it could improve its margins. He also cited price cuts instituted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and increased competition from the likes of Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG), which has highlighted key capabilities of its cloud business recently, as reasons for limited operating margins in that business.  Amazon is famous for operating with low margins in its e-commerce business. But analysts and investors have sent its shares on an upward trajectory in anticipation of expected returns, once e-commerce overtakes physical retail. The company’s shares have also bumped up in the last two years after it revealed run rates for its cloud business. Given that infrastructure is the main expense for cloud, the operating margins for Amazon Web Services have increased as the number of customers for its services has multiplied. For example, its AWS operating margins increased from 16.9% in 2015 to 27% two quarters ago. However, the company disclosed a decline in cloud operating margins this past quarter. (For more, see also: Amazon Tumbles After Hours on Revenue Miss.) Despite the downgrade, Kessler’s assessment of Amazon’s earnings this Thursday remains in line with estimates by other analysts. He has forecast revenues of $35.5 billion on earnings per share of $2.37. The Street’s consensus is for earnings of $35.34 billion on earnings per share of $2.35.

Tobacco makers have seen their operating profits surge 77% to $18.4 billion between 2006 and 2016, figures provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research show. (For more, see also: Behind Tobacco Stocks' Recent Strength.) Amid this period of strong profitability, the stocks of Altria Group Inc. (MO) and Reynolds American, Inc.

Altria and Reynolds American had 46.6% and 33.6% shares of this market in 2015, according to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) data reported on by the Journal. The two companies have developed these dominant positions as the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a development that has helped major players generate billions in cost savings. As for how the industry will fare going forward, tobacco companies face significant regulatory headwinds, according to the Journal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may be able to prohibit the sale of menthol cigarettes—which have been shown to be more dangerous than regular cigarettes—as a result of a law passed in 2009. As a result, many industry firms have been exploring innovative approaches that provide lower health risks than traditional cigarettes.

The firm, which has an Outperform rating for the stock, raised its price target on Apple by $10 to $170 based on its assessment. (See also: Apple Bets on Apps, Services to Fuel Growth.) In the note, which takes a deep dive into Apple's business, Credit Suisse predicts that the Cupertino, California-based company's Services segment could turn into a substantial annual revenue stream and contribute as much as 33 percent to Apple's gross profit. The firm's analysts wrote in their note ""that the markets underestimate gross profit contribution from Services but, more importantly, that it underappreciates its growth potential and the annuity-type business it drives in terms of retention and replacement across the business."" Credit Suisse estimates that revenue from Apple's Services segment will double to $52 billion by 2020 from its current $26 billion figure. Gross profit from the business will show a similar trajectory, doubling to $39 billion from $19 billion today. Apple's Services segment includes its iTunes App store, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple Music. (See also: Apple Rises on Services and iPhone X Bullishness.) The primary drivers for this growth are an increase in the number of installed Apple devices and the company's attractive customer demographics. According to Credit Suisse, the number of Apple devices will increase from 1 billion today to 1.5 billion by 2020. A high retention rate of over 90 percent and increased average customer spend will further boost Apple's Services revenues. (See also: Apple Said to Be Forming a Division for Cloud Services.) In their note, the analysts also evaluated Apple's services stack, which includes an assortment of hardware and software offerings. This is important because provision of services is intimately linked with the creation of a hardware ecosystem for technology companies. For example, Apple's hardware offerings are a tightly controlled, closed ecosystem that runs on iOS, its mobile operating system. In contrast, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google's Android smartphones and tablets are manufactured by third-party manufacturers. They are open source and run on a mobile operating system that is customized to different flavors by these manufacturers. (See also: Android App Spending to Surpass Apple in 2017.) Apple holds an edge here because its devices have already attained a cult-like following among users and customers. That edge is complemented by a variety of mechanisms that the company has put in place to offer content and other services. (See also: Top 3 Cult Stocks for 2017.) For example, Apple Music is already the second most popular music streaming platform after Spotify. Similarly, the Apple TV app competes with the likes of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) in the video streaming business. Apple is also a player in the gaming industry with its iTunes platform, which was responsible for last year's megahit Pokemon Go. Then, there is Apple Pay, which can be used for payment, while iMessage competes with the likes of Facebook Inc.'s (FB) WhatsApp in the messaging sweepstakes. In sum, Apple's services stack is comprehensive and already generates substantial revenue to contribute to its bottom line, unlike those of its competitors. (See also: Apple May See $3B in Pokemon Go Revenue.) According to Credit Suisse, Apple's customers and devices are high end. This means that its devices have premium prices and are bought by affluent users, who transact frequently on them. Credit Suisse analysts posit that this trend is expected to continue in the future, as Apple expands to new markets, such as India and China. In fact, Credit Suisse predicts that Apple's spend per user will accelerate from approximately $68 in 2015 to $135 by 2020. ""iPhone users earn more than their Android counterparts, and this indicates higher monetization potential (for the company),"" the research firm's analysts wrote in their note. (See also: Apple Set to Begin Manufacturing in India.) The analyst note also contains suggestions for Apple to generate more business from its Services segment. According to the analysts, Apple needs to double down on video streaming to generate more revenue. They suggested four routes that the company could take to gain traction from video streaming. First, Apple could continue its current strategy of enabling video downloads through its iTunes platform. However, the total addressable market for such a strategy is low, Credit Suisse analysts write. Second, Apple could aggregate a skinny bundle (similar to rival Google, which recently debuted YouTube TV) for customers. Third, it could produce original programming to attract users to its platform. Fourth, Apple could take the acquisition route and buy up a major streaming provider. Netflix is the best target, according to Credit Suisse. (See also: Google Launches YouTube TV.) To be sure, Apple is already doing most of the things mentioned by the analysts. For example, it launched an updated version of its Apple TV app that features new partnerships with cable companies. The company is also said to be in talks with studios to produce original content for its app. (See also: Apple Pursues the Holy Grail of Original Content.)

John Shinal,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Google's own Internet services grabbed an increasing share of digital advertising away from the partner sites that use its technology in the first quarter, yet another sign the Internet giant is extending its dominance over all online ad rivals other than Facebook. The company said first quarter ad sales on its properties rose 21 percent during the period, while those on its partners' sites climbed just 8.6 percent. Google's own sales now comprise 81 percent of the ad revenue derived from its online network, at $17.4 billion, up from 71 percent a year ago. Total ad sales from all sources rose almost 19 percent to $21.4 billion. ""The increase in (Google) sites revenue reflects healthy growth in mobile search,"" Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said on a conference call with analysts late Thursday. Google has been updating the algorithm it uses to display search results to weed out sites marked by fake news, malware and other unsavory content. It's also been dropping in its rankings mobile sites whose pages are unstable or take a long time to load on consumer's smartphones. While the changes have been made in part to improve the Internet experience of online consumers, they're also benefitting the company's business. Alphabet reported first quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, with sales rising 22 percent from a year ago to $24.75 billion. Its shares rose as much as 4 percent in after-hours trading. ""The growth for the size of the company is actually pretty amazing,"" Denny Fish, a portfolio manager at Janus, told CNBC after the results were released. The revenue gains were driven by a surge in activity on Google services, including its search page and services ranging from Gmail to YouTube. The company said the number of paid clicks on its properties rose a whopping 53 percent year-over-year, while the rise on its partners' sites was a small fraction of that, at 10 percent. The total number of clicks rose 44 percent. Meanwhile, the cost-per-click on Google sites fell 21 percent as the company gets ever more efficient in providing results for advertisers. At the same time, its YouTube property has been garnering an increasing share of video ad dollars. ",Alphabet's Google unit grabbing ever more ad revenue from partners
By Sheera Frenkel,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Google's servers in Cuba went live on Wednesday, making the internet giant the first foreign internet company to host content within the long cut-off country. The servers are part of Google's global network of caching servers, called GGC nodes, the servers work by storing popular content — like a viral YouTube video — on a local server. Instead of having to travel the long distance through a submarine cable, which currently connects Cuba to the internet through Venezuela, Cubans will now be able to access content through the nearest Google server in their country. ""I think this will be very noticeable for Cubans,"" said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Dyn, a global internet monitoring company. ""The internet in Cuba will still be a painfully slow process. This is just another somewhat rare step forward. For Google services, which will be hosted in country, it will be a milestone."" Despite hopes that Cuba would begin opening up its internet access following the re-establishment of diplomatic between the US and Cuba in 2015, Cuba still has the lowest level of internet connectivity in the western hemisphere. For most Cubans, the internet can only be accessed through 240 public access wi-fi spots dotted around the country. An hour of internet access costs roughly $1.50, which for Cubans earning the country's average wage of $25 a month, can be prohibitively expensive. Cuba's State Telecommunications company, Etecsa, recently begun running a pilot program to install internet connections in 2,000 homes throughout the country, but once the pilot is over the service will cost around $15 for 30 hours of internet at a slow speed of 128 kilobytes per second — a similarly off-putting price for most Cubans. Google acknowledges that the deal won't do much to increase internet access for the average person in Cuba. In a blog post  published last December to mark the signing of the deal between Cuba and the tech giant, Google executives wrote, ""Cubans who already have access to the internet and want to use our services can expect to see an improvement in terms of quality of service and reduced latency for cached content."" Madory, however, said that it appeared that Google was rolling out the change slowly. When he tested the service Wednesday morning using a server in Cuba he could access remotely, he was still being directed to Google services outside the country. ""I can see the server is there and I can interact with it, but Cubans are not yet getting automatically connected to it.""

In March, the Justice Department arrested Evaldas Rimasauskas, the man they believe is at the center of the cyber crime, the publication reported. However, the names of the companies at the center of the scam weren't initially disclosed in the indictment. Meanwhile, the accused—who is being held in Lithuania pending extradition—has denied the allegations. According to information obtained by Fortune, from 2013-2015 Rimasauskas allegedly impersonated Quanta Computer, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, by sending phishing emails to staffers at both Google and Facebook that requested payment for goods and services. After the companies wired the money intended for Quanta, Rimasauskas was alleged to have moved the funds to different bank accounts around the world to places such as Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong. In order to obtain the transferred funds, he is said to have forged the signatures of Facebook and Google executives on invoices, contracts, and letters that he submitted to banks. Before getting caught, Rimasauskas allegedly received a total of $100 million in transfers from both Google and Facebook. Neither company reported the losses to the SEC as a 'material event', Fortune reported.

Michelle Castillo,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Earlier this week, the advertising industry was alarmed at a report that suggested Google was developing an ad blocker for its Chrome browser. The report, it turns out, is partially true. Google is thinking about making the ad-blocker – and has discussed the idea with others in the advertising industry — but the end-product might not be as threatening as it first sounded. Google has talked with the Coalition for Better Ads — an ad industry trade group — regarding an ad blocking feature on its Chrome browser, several sources told CNBC.  Theoretically, it would work similarly to Chrome's update in 2015 that blocked all ads that used Adobe Flash technology, and would not discriminate if the ad was placed by Google's ad exchanges or another competing service, a source said. But if it becomes a reality, the end product would likely be very friendly towards advertisers and media companies, and adhere to industry standards that are currently being hashed out, said Coalition for Better Ads' counsel Stu Ingis. Those standards are likely to be determined in the next six months to a year, Ingis said. Ingis said calling the proposed product an ""ad blocker"" isn't strictly accurate. ""To me an 'ad blocker' is a company blocking ads and eliminating the consumer interest in experience without any dialogue with these [advertising and publisher] companies,"" said Ingis. ""I would view anything that is adopting this type of standard process set forth by the industry based on the consumer research as not an 'ad blocker.'"" If Google does decide to make the Chrome feature, the goal would be to provide users with choice and options about their online experience, a Google spokesperson said. Google agreed that it would also be in line with guidelines set by the advertising industry. ""We've said publicly for awhile now that Google alone cannot solve the bad experiences users have online — we need a data-driven industry approach to improving ads experiences,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""As a member of the [Coalition], we've been talking to a number industry associations, publishers, advertisers and other technology companies about the development of the Better Ads Standard. One option we're exploring is how Chrome could help support this Standard. We can't confirm any additional details or timing right now."" The Coalition is creating guidelines to improve the online ad experience with input from its members,  which include Facebook, News Corp., Procter & Gamble and Unilever, as well as agencies like Group M and Omnicom. The organization is also including information from its 25,000-person survey on what they disliked about online advertising. Google has been a ""very collaborative participant,"" Ingis added. But the ad industry's worries aren't completely soothed, and agencies say there are still unanswered questions. IPG Mediabrands senior vice president of ad operations Mitch Weinstein pointed out several potential conflicts-of-interest. Would the service would only allow ads served (or placed on websites) through Google's owned-and-operated services? Would YouTube ads would be blocked if watched through a Chrome browser? ""[There's] a lot of questions on this, but it could potentially be a very big deal,"" he said. Google has no plans to exempt itself, a source with knowledge of project said. Slow-loading websites, inaccessible content, and cluttered webpages have made many people hate online advertising, Weinstein said. At the same time, ads are a necessary part of the ecosystem because it's a major source of revenue for online publishers. IPG Mediabrands is also working with several organizations to make sure its ads are ""lighter and less intrusive,"" to keep customers happy. Advertisers are always concerned when they hear the words ""ad blocker,"" said BBH communications planner Zack Green. But if Google creates its own with everyone's input, it could be an big win for them. The company could develop its own ad format that wouldn't be blocked, Green pointed out. It would also force the entire industry to think more ""creatively"" to find ways to weave ads into content, he added. ""Google is giving people what they want, but it's also may be a place for Google to come up with their own bespoke in-line ad opportunities,"" he said.

""As the poor folks at Snapchat are finding, these companies can crush even well-capitalized companies like Snapchat, by just knocking off their features,"" Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Monday. Recently public, Snap makes its money from advertising. Despite Snapchat's popularity, eMarketer projects that it will  account for only about 1.3 percent of the U.S. mobile ad market this year. Meanwhile, Facebook has introduced copycat features to rival Snapchat. One solution, Taplin said, is to treat companies like Google as a ""utility"" that's required to share its patents with the rest of the community. Google does make many of its products available to developers and consumers for free, and many tech innovations actually reduce prices for consumers — not typical of an economic monopoly. Still, Taplin said, ""you could argue that Google is a natural monopoly."" ""The problem is, the rise of Google, Facebook and Amazon has meant the fall of the creative economy,"" Taplin said citing falling profits in industries like books, newspapers, music and movies. Taplin is the author of ""Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy."" In an opinion piece for The New York Times this week, Taplin argued that rather than drive down the cut that musicians and artists get for their work, the tech giants need to share more of their revenue.

 ,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Supported by By David Streitfeld The day is still distant when you can actually own a self-driving car, but in certain parts of the Phoenix area, hundreds of people will soon be integrating one into their daily lives. Waymo, the self-driving-car outfit spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been putting millions of miles on its autonomous cars in various cities for years. On Tuesday, the company was to announce the next phase of testing: putting ordinary people inside its Chrysler minivans and Lexuses. Those accepted into the program, which has already begun quietly operating, will summon a car with an app and then go about their business. They will be encouraged to use the vehicles to go anywhere they would normally go at any hour — the office, the movies, the supermarket, even a late-night search for ice cream. Waymo is not charging those involved in the trial. It says it is casting a broad net for all types of people in an effort to accumulate reams of data about how driverless cars will be used in practice and not just in theory. “We’ve given 10,000 rides internally, but if you’re just providing experiences to folks inside the company, you’re missing the broader range of diversity,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive, said. The application, on the Waymo website, is relatively brief. It asks for an address, the members of a household and a reason for applying. Choices include: “I think the technology is awesome,” “I want more time and resources back during my commute,” and “I dislike driving and think a self-driving car would be safer.” Applicants are not allowed to select “all of the above.” Only those who live in Chandler, Mesa, Tempe and Gilbert — roughly the southeastern Phoenix area — will be eligible for the program. And the cars, for that matter, will not take them anywhere else — no weekend jaunts to the Grand Canyon. Waymo, which has cautiously expanded the testing of its autonomous vehicles, did not give a specific number of people it hopes to enroll in the program beyond saying it would be in the hundreds. The company is adding 500 specially outfitted Chrysler minivans to its self-driving fleet, up from 100 now. Many of the minivans are destined for Phoenix. Uber, the ride-hailing company that is Waymo’s biggest and bitterest competitor, began deploying self-driving cars in September in Pittsburgh. In December, it expanded the testing to San Francisco, but the city forced it to stop because its permits were not in order. Uber moved to Tempe, Ariz., before it began testing again in San Francisco. Self-driving cars have evolved rapidly, with plenty of accompanying drama, but there are many miles to go. All the Waymo cars will have a technician who can take control in an emergency. Waymo is also doing testing in the San Francisco Bay Area, near Seattle and in Austin. It has been working closely with Fiat Chrysler, leading to speculation they will jointly form a ride-hailing service that will compete directly with Uber. “We’re not about building better cars; we’re about building better drivers,” Mr. Krafcik said. In February, Waymo sued Uber in federal court, claiming the company was using self-driving car technology stolen by Anthony Levandowski, a former employee. But Uber says it started developing the component — called lidar, for light detection and ranging sensors — before it acquired Otto, a company created by Mr. Levandowski, who now runs Uber’s self-driving car effort. Waymo has asked the court to file an order halting Uber’s self-driving car work with an injunction. Several months before filing its suit against Uber, Google also demanded arbitration against Mr. Levandowski, claiming he had used confidential salary information while trying to poach former colleagues to his new venture. It is not clear if the arbitration was settled. Uber is arguing that the Waymo suit should also be decided in arbitration because the claims stem from Mr. Levandowski’s time at Google and are covered by an arbitration clause in his employment contract.

 ,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving automobiles they are building under an expanding partnership. The companies announced in the spring of last year that they would build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles have been tested in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo, Google's self-driving care project, said Tuesday that it will allow hundreds of people in Phoenix to take rides in the vehicles so that it can get feedback on the experience. People can apply on Waymo's website. The company also said that it's expanding its fleet to 500 Pacifica hybrids. Waymo — created by Google in 2009 — has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Others in the race to develop self-driving vehicles have been putting people in their cars since last fall. Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh for some time. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. ""This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology,"" said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Our early riders will play an important role in shaping the way we bring self-driving technology into the world through personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics and more. Self-driving cars have the potential to reshape each and every one of these areas, transforming our lives and our cities by making them safer, more convenient and more accessible. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration.

Some key creators of that project — the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU — recently left to team up with Chamath Palihapitiya, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent and outspoken young venture investors, on a stealth start-up. Groq Inc. is the name of the company, at least for the time being. There are no promotional materials or website. All that exists online are a couple SEC filings from October and December showing that the company raised $10.3 million, and an incorporation filing in the state of Delaware on Sept. 12. ""We're really excited about Groq,"" Palihapitiya wrote in an e-mail. ""It's too early to talk specifics, but we think what they're building could become a fundamental building block for the next generation of computing.""

The listed address is Social Capital's headquarters. Palihapitiya told CNBC last month that he invested in a team of ex-Googlers who helped build the chip, which he first heard about on an earnings call 2 ½ years ago. ""They randomly mentioned that they built their own chip for AI and I thought, 'what is going on here, why is Google competing with Intel?'"" Palihapitiya said in an interview on ""Squawk Box."" The company (which we now know is Groq) now has eight of the first 10 people from the TPU team ""building a next-generation chip,"" he said.

Also, the incumbents — Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia — are massive, and Google, Apple and Amazon are developing their own silicon. As crazy as it may be, Palihapitiya is taking the plunge. This next wave of chip innovation ""can empower companies like Facebook and Amazon, Tesla, the government to do things with machine learning and computers that nobody could do before,"" he said in last month's interview. Ross' LinkedIn page says he left Google in September and is currently ""gainfully unemployed."" According to Wightman's profile, he left the same month but doesn't say where he went. Wightman confirmed the funding in an e-mail and said, ""We're still heads down right now."" Google made its first public pronouncement about the TPU in May with a blog post just ahead of the company's annual developers conference. Norm Jouppi, one of the project heads, said Google had been using the technology internally for over a year for things like improving the relevance of search results and the accuracy of its maps. It's also part of Google's Cloud Platform in a product called TensorFlow that lets other companies run machine learning workloads in Google's data centers. The essence of TPUs is the ability to squeeze heavy and highly sophisticated computation into less silicon. Machine learning, or the training of computers to get smarter as data sets increase and without the need for human interference, is weaving its way into all types of consumer and business apps. At Google's scale, that work is too taxing for today's processors. Palihapitiya said at a conference in January that the main reason he's bullish on Google as an investment is because ""they're an order of magnitude ahead"" of everyone else. He's not the only investor paying attention. Denny Fish, a portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Janus, said Google is doing everything it can to ensure maximum performance and efficiency to handle the heft of machine learning workloads. ""They've said, if we're going to do this and win, we need the most efficient way using the least amount of power,"" he said. ""They feel like they've cracked the code."" Earlier this month, Google provided its first real update on TPUs in a 17-page report titled, ""In-Datacenter performance analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit."" In a summary blog post, Jouppi wrote that AI workloads using TPUs are running 15 to 30 times faster than contemporary processors, while efficiency is 30 to 80 times better. The study compared TPUs to chips from Intel and Nvidia. Ross was one of 75 authors of the report. He's also listed in the paper as an inventor on four patents, all tied to neural networks processors and computation, which you can think of as computing systems designed to mimic the brain. Ross' LinkedIn page says he started the TPU with one other engineer as part of a 20 percent project, the perk that lets Google employees spend one-fifth of their time working on a side project they think will benefit the company. From 2013 to 2015, he worked as a Google hardware engineer in Madison, Wisconsin, home to one of the principal hotbeds of TPU development. Wightman co-founded four companies before his Google days. At Google X he worked on futuristic projects like Loon, a network of balloons that's setting out to provide a more extensive internet.

Ari Levy,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Alphabet's effort to catch Amazon's cloud is taking center stage at one of the media industry's biggest conferences of the year. In an exclusive interview with CNBC.com prior to the event, Shaukat said the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can help media businesses move faster at a lower cost, personalize their messages and increase their revenue. As in every industry it's attacking, GCP faces a tall task with the biggest media companies. Amazon Web Services (AWS) ran off to about a seven-year head start and has dominant market share over its top challengers, Microsoft, Google and IBM. ""This is one of the top verticals we're investing in,"" Shaukat said. Within media in particular, Google is touting a product called Zync that enables high-speed rendering of projects that are bandwidth intensive. From animated TV shows to virtual reality content, teams of artists and designers can turn to Google's cloud to quickly and affordably get their work into production. Such businesses can still use AWS for their data storage and server needs, while turning to GCP for specific projects, even as Google is competing for the other stuff. ""We're finding that almost without exception every customer we have is a multi-cloud customer,"" Shaukat said. AWS, as the market leader, doesn't talk much about a multi-cloud world. Rather, AWS CEO Andy Jassy said at a summit last week that clients are running more of their workloads in Amazon because developer teams don't want to learn multiple systems and code bases. And the more work they do in AWS, the more they can take advantage of volume discounts, he said. Google has notched some high-profile media wins. Snap said in its IPO prospectus earlier this year that it's spending $400 million a year with GCP, twice as much as its average annual AWS outlay. Spotify announced last year that it was exiting its own data centers in favor of Google's. Spotify's online and mobile music service requires some of the magic that makes Google's search engine work: speed and personalization. ""The focus on personalization is hugely important to customers we're talking to,"" Shaukat said. In addition to its ability to quickly make recommendations for customers, Google's big data and machine learning tools are also helping businesses in need of speech-to-text services, image recognition and video search, Shaukat said. Media companies at NAB will be able to hear competing messages from Amazon. The conference features a session on securing content in the AWS cloud and another on how Discovery Communications uses AWS to support hundreds of channels across the globe.

Cora Lewis,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"Google has committed to not retaliate against workers — both direct employees and contracted staff — who take time off from work to protest the Trump administration's policies on May 1, BuzzFeed News has learned. Google has said the policy of non-retaliation applies whether or not workers ask for time off in advance of the day. For months now, workers across the country have been planning a  May 1 General Strike across industries, with a focus on immigrant, low-wage, and subcontracted workers, in protest of Trump's administration's policies and in support of labor rights. SEIU-USWW, a powerful California-based local of the Service Employees International Union, has led the call, along with the Brandworkers food chain workers alliance. In the past few weeks, Facebook and  other tech firms have committed to not retaliating against their employees who choose to demonstrate on that date, traditionally observed as International Workers Day.  Labor advocates have pushed them to extend their policies towards their sub-contracted workforces as well, who are not directly employed by the tech giants. Facebook has said it would ""re-evaluate its ties to any vendor if it breaks the law that protects workers' rights to organize and protect themselves,""  Bloomberg reported. And Google said if it becomes aware of any illegal actions by vendors, it will investigate and take any necessary follow up. However, neither company provided more specifics on how they would protect contracted workers if the vendors who do employ them choose to retaliate. More from BuzzFeed News:  Workers involved in union activities say Tesla is illegally intimidating them   This lawsuit could change how waiters get paid   Women ironworkers will get six months of paid maternity leave ""We respect everyone's choice to act on their beliefs,"" a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News. ""We care deeply about creating an environment at Google where everyone — employees and contractors, engineers, cafeteria workers and janitorial staff — feels comfortable doing so. We're asking managers to be flexible in accommodating time-off requests and have let our vendor partners know that we support them doing the same."" In an email to Google suppliers reviewed by BuzzFeed News, with the subject line, ""As May 1 approaches,"" the company states, ""As you've likely seen in the press, there has been some discussion around May 1 events in the U.S. I wanted to get in touch to let you know how we're approaching this."" The email includes the above statement as well as the line, ""It's our hope that you'll take a similar approach,"" and concludes by asking vendors to ""reach out to your Google contact"" if they ""would like to discuss."" While  Google, Facebook, and other tech companies permitted engineers and other highly-paid employees to take time off to protest when President Trump first instituted an immigration ban on Muslim-majority countries, the employers are being more explicit about mentioning their sub-contracted workers this time around. That's partly thanks to pressure and organizing by California-based labor groups like Silicon Valley Rising and unions like UNITE HERE, which have sent in-person delegations and letters to major corporations, asking that they specify their policies towards the labor forces down the employment chain. Meghan Cohorst, a spokesperson for UNITE HERE, said in email to BuzzFeed News that the union is ""very happy that Google has joined with other companies in the tech industry and made a public commitment to ensure that all workers employed in its offices are able to freely and safely participate in May Day actions.""

Andrew Tonner,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- the holding company formerly known as Google -- are, in all likelihood, the two most powerful technology companies in the world today. To avoid burying the lede, both companies have outstanding economics and deserve a place as core technology holdings in many investors' portfolios. However, that isn't to say one company doesn't present a more compelling option for investors right now. As such, this article will analyze Alphabet and Apple stocks through three important dimensions to see which company is more deserving of investors' attention in the here and now. Both Apple and Alphabet are two absurdly profitable companies. With cash positions dwarfing the annual economic output of some pretty large countries, these two companies are financial fortresses in every sense of the word. Here's a quick breakdown of a few of the most commonly used solvency and liquidity metrics for both companies. Data sources: Apple investor relations, Alphabet investor relations, Yahoo! Finance. Cash from operations reflects most recent 12 months. Most importantly, Alphabet and Apple carry effectively no financial risk. Their respective net-cash positions of $82.4 billion and $158.6 billion alone are larger than most successful companies' total market capitalizations, and this totally overlooks the tens of billions in operating cash flow Apple and Alphabet generate annually. Sure, Alphabet's current ratio trounces that of Apple. However, taken in the context of Apple's broader business. Neither company is at any risk of falling short of its financial commitments. And given that Apple edges Alphabet out in terms of net cash and cash-flow generation, the Mac maker deserves a win in the first category of this analysis. Image source: Apple. As alluded to in the introduction, both Apple and Alphabet enjoy considerable durable competitive advantages. For Apple, the company's unique ability to combine beautifully designed hardware with its internal software and app ecosystems allows the consumer electronics giant to command prices far higher than those of its peers. Last year, Apple recorded a $645 average selling price (ASP) for the iPhone, compared to $217 for the average Android handset. This device premium has allowed Apple to consistently capture the overwhelming majority of smartphone industry profits in recent years; one sell-side analyst estimated that Apple earned 92% of all smartphone market profits in Q4 2016. This pricing power is the heart and soul of Apple's competitive advantages, and it seems likely to endure into the company's coming device cycle as Apple launches a totally redesigned iPhone 8 this fall. Alphabet dominates its core internet search business in much the same way that Apple controls the smartphone market. The search giant typically controls two-thirds of the global search market, a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that the Google search engine is blocked and effectively inaccessible in China. According to recent data, Google receives over 30 billion search queries each month across its various platforms. This breadth of exposure and the intent-based nature of Google's searches enabled the Internet giant to command 31% of global online advertising spending last year, and evidence suggests Facebook and Alphabet will continue to capture greater percentages of online ad-spend in the future. This platform gives Alphabet a massive profit stream that the tech giant has aggressively funneled back into a series of futuristic business ideas it collects in its Other Bets reporting segment. Though they garner significant media attention, Google's only real profit center -- and the source of its massive competitive advantages -- is its search business. Image source: Google. Turning to the third area of this investigation, here's a quick overview of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics as a starting point to frame our discussion. Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Obviously, Apple is cheaper on an absolute basis. However, the key to finding attractive stocks to buy lies in finding relative mispricings between a company's current valuation and its expected future performance. We can do this through a number of ways. One popular metric that tries to capture this is the PEG ratio, which compares companies' growth estimates against their valuations, Alphabet trades at a PEG ratio of 1.3, while Apple is, in theory, slightly more expensive with a PEG ratio of 1.7; a PEG ratio of 1 is, in theory, correctly valued. However, with the average analyst estimating it will grow sales 6% this year, I see Apple's elevated PEG ratio more as a reflection that Wall Street is underestimating Apple's growth potential in the year ahead. Furthermore, Apple's dividend yield and the likelihood that it will increase its capital return program in the coming quarterly report further enhances the company's return profile. This one is tough, but I see Apple as more attractively valued than Alphabet based on my thesis that the market is underestimating the iPhone 8's potential impact. Hopefully, you sensed that both companies are indeed worthy investments. However, Apple holds a slight edge in today's analysis because of its cheaper relative valuation and its more easily identifiable near-term growth catalyst in the form of the iPhone 8. Still, you can't go wrong holding either tech giant as a part of the core technology stocks in your portfolio for the long term. ","
      
    Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. Google -- The Motley Fool

Danny Vena,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. As smartphones rose to prominence, one of the expected side effects was increasing adoption of the digital wallet -- apps on a smartphone designed to store credit card information and used to facilitate mobile payments. As it turns out, consumers are creatures of habit, and the rate of adoption has been slower than expected. Consumers have become accustomed to swiping credit or debit cards and aren't ready to switch just yet. A recent report by Statista revealed that just 14% of U.S. consumers had used a mobile payment to make a purchase in 2016, though that number is expected to grow to 18% in 2017, and to 37% by 2021. The transaction value of these payments totaled $24 billion in the U.S. last year. PayPal joins forces with Google in the digital wallet. Image source: PayPal. Seeking to get their share of this nascent opportunity, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google are joining forces. The partnership will allow users to link their PayPal account to Android Pay, Google's mobile payments platform. The companies are expanding on a collaboration that started nearly three years ago, with PayPal being added as a payment option for Google Play, the company's online app store. Consumers upload their credit card information into a digital wallet app in their phone, which allows users to pass their smartphone over a terminal equipped with near-field communications technology rather than swiping or inserting their credit card. These mobile payment systems use one-time-only codes, rather than the card number, making them a more secure form of payment. Ironically, worries about personal data and fear of fraud are the most cited reasons among consumers who have not yet used mobile payments, according to Statista. Image source: Google. PayPal, whose service got its start as a secure payment option on websites, has been partnering with a growing number of companies to expand its footprint. Over the past year, PayPal has announced deals with major credit card processors Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated, and most recently Discover Financial Services, along with a host of other providers. PayPal believes that by partnering with other companies it will provide more choices to consumers. Google is hoping to increase adoption of its mobile-payment service, which has been lagging competitor Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the digital-wallet space. Statista reports that while 12% of consumers have used Apple Pay for a transaction, only 9% have used Android pay, and 6% have used Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Pay, the other major smartphone-based mobile wallet. The principal reason for its lead is availability. Apple Pay is accepted at 36% of U.S. merchants, followed by Android Pay at 24%, and Samsung Pay at third with 18%. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) boasts one of the most popular store-only mobile payments. The company launched its app in 2011, one of the first such hybrid programs joining a mobile-payment app with a customer-loyalty program. Statista reports that mobile payments accounted for 25% of all Starbucks' transactions in the United States. The coffee purveyor has taken things a step further with its Mobile Order & Pay program, by allowing customers to order and pay in advance and pick up their purchase without waiting in a register line. Starbucks recently announced the opening of a location at the company's Seattle headquarters that will only accept ordering and payments via mobile. We are still early in the adoption cycle, and as digital wallet technology becomes more pervasive, companies are vying for their share of the proceeds. These transactions are expected to grow at a rate of 52% annually to $866 billion by 2021. The digital payment space is highly fragmented, with a host of options available to consumers. These partnerships and innovative solutions are only the beginning of a trend that will be years in the making. ","

Matthew Cochrane,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Last month, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced Gmail users would now be able to send and receive money on Android devices through its Google Wallet platform. The service had been available through Gmail since 2013 but, until last month, was unavailable on mobile devices. To use the service, all that is needed is to compose a new email in the Gmail app on any Android mobile device. Once a new email is opened, users simply choose the ""Send money"" or ""Request money"" options under he attachment icon. After a debit card is linked and the amount of money is selected, the funds can then be sent to anyone with an email address or phone number. The recipient does not need to be an existing Google Wallet user or have a Gmail account and is free to all users. The service is currently only available in the United States and United Kingdom. Image source: Pixabay. The feature is the latest attempt by Alphabet to engage its over one billion active Gmail users. The Android operating system, which runs on most smartphones and tablets, had 1.4 billion active users as of September 2015. The overlap between the two is almost certain to be in the hundreds of millions, making this new feature an avenue Alphabet could pursue to deepen its relationships with its huge account holder base. While Alphabet has never released official figures on how many active users exist on Google Wallet, it doesn't take too much digging to discover it is not widely used; a situation almost assuredly of Alphabet's own making. From the beginning, the platform has struggled from a lack of attention and strategy from its parent company. As a prime example of this neglect, this very feature of using Gmail to send money to other people was first available to desktop users in 2013. Yet it took four additional years for Google to incorporate it into Gmail's app on mobile devices. Image source: Alphabet Inc's Google blog. Originally, NFC (near field communication) technology was to be used in conjunction with Google Wallet so that the app could be used to make point-of-sale (POS) purchases. However, this capability was dropped in September 2015. In 2016, Google discontinued the Google Wallet card, a physical debit card linked directly to one's Google Wallet account. These decisions effectively ended any way customers could use their Google Wallet accounts to make POS transactions at physical retail locations, though there are some work-arounds, such as linking a Google Wallet account to Android Pay, a separate payment app available only to Android users. The constant meddling with Google Wallet's capabilities has certainly contributed to its lagging popularity. It is now essentially a P2P payment platform left to compete with the likes of PayPal Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo and the newly launched Zelle, a P2P app provided by many of the nation's largest banks to their customers. Google Wallet will have to overcome many obstacles if it is to capture significant market share. In Accenture's 2016 North America Consumer Digital Payments Survey, consumers indicated they trusted traditional card providers, alternative payment providers (e.g. PayPal), and established retail banks as potential mobile payment providers over larger tech companies. And the competition isn't standing still. In 2016's fourth quarter, PayPal's Venmo app, a hit with millennials, facilitated $5.6 billion in payment volume, an eye-popping 126% increase year over year! In December 2016, Venmo crossed the $2 billion total payment volume mark in a single month for the first time in its history. It was just earlier in the year when it first passed the $1 billion threshold in a single month! Zelle is a P2P payment service operated by Early Warning which is owned by some of the country's largest financial institutions including Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, JP Morgan Chase, PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo. As with Google Wallet's new service, these banks' account holders will be able to send and receive funds using nothing more than a person's email address or phone number. Many of Zelle's future users will be able to access the service through their existing mobile banking apps, meaning no additional apps will need to be downloaded onto their smartphones. Will this latest feature spark renewed interest and user engagement in Google Wallet? While it is impossible to tell, I believe it is highly unlikely, although I certainly see some uses for it. Earlier this spring, I was exchanging emails with my sister about an upcoming summer vacation our families were taking together. She mentioned she would book a large cabin in the mountains and I could pay her back later. It would have been nice to simply respond via email with the accompanying payment attached. While I know it would not have taken much effort to sign up for the service, it still would have taken more effort than using PayPal, a service my sister and I both regularly use. And, while it is possible to send money through Gmail to people who are not yet users of the service or who do not have a Gmail address, I did not want to put my sister through the aggravation of having to link her debit card to the email to retrieve the money. The uphill battle Google Wallet faces is one many platforms are familiar with -- once users are comfortable using a certain system, it's tough to get them to switch. PayPal's core platform currently has 200 million active accounts and is consistently growing by double-digit percentages each year. As noted above, Venmo is currently growing by triple-digit percentages year over year. Given the gigantic lead these two PayPal platforms enjoy, it's hard to see Google Wallet closing the gap without a huge marketing push and lots of accompanying attention from its parent company. With Alphabet's track record with Google Wallet, that's not something to count on. ","

Chris Neiger,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Himax Technologies' (NASDAQ:HIMX) stock price has seen some highs over the past few years on the prospects that design wins in augmented reality (AR) devices will bring big gains for the company -- only for share prices to tumble as those opportunities never quite panned out. The first instance of market excitement happened a few years ago when Alphabet's Google took a 6.3% investment stake in Himax, with an option to purchase another 14.8%. Google was building out its Glass device, and many Himax investors were expecting huge benefits from the partnership between the two companies. In the end, Glass hit major roadblocks -- mainly from the public -- and it never became the device Google or Himax expected. Due, at least in part, to the Glass partnership sputtering, Himax's share price took a cliff dive in early 2014: HIMX price chart by YCharts. Since then the company's share price has been much more volatile, and subsequent AR design wins, like the Microsoft Hololens, have also failed to bring share-price gains for Himax, though the stock hasn't experienced anything as dramatic as the 2014 slide. So are Himax's growth days over? The short answer: probably not. But it could take a little while longer before the company regains its bearings. It's easy to fall into the trap of believing that whatever's happened in the past will happen again in the future. For Himax, that means that failing to capitalize on Google Glass and Microsoft's Hololens doesn't necessarily mean that the company can't substantially benefit from this market. The AR market will reach an estimated $117 billion by 2022, according to Markets and Markets research, and Himax has a strong position in the space. The company has been working with 30 AR-related companies over the past 15 years, and that experience and exposure to the augmented reality market could be lucrative -- but the company has noted that the benefits might not be seen until later next year. One promising bit of news lately was the company's investment in Emza Visual Sense, which makes visual sensors and proprietary machine-vision algorithm tech. Himax now owns 45% of the company with a one-year option to purchase the rest of it. The company says that gaining some of Emza's technology could help it expand its offerings across a handful of its businesses, including augmented and virtual reality. I've been bearish on Himax in the past because I think investors tie this company too closely to one AR play, and then when that device doesn't pan out, the stock tanks. I'm not changing my position on that, but I do think the company has potential if it can score several big design wins and spread its risk out among several companies. Himax is gearing up for new products within its AR business in the latter part of this year and into 2018, which could eventually help bring revenue and boost the share price as a result. In light of this opportunity, I'd take a carefully optimistic approach to Himax for the time being, and wait to see how the company fares over the next few quarters. ","

Investors already know that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is actively searching for its next big hit, be it autonomous electric cars, augmented reality, or a toaster-refrigerator. There's now a clue of another possible idea floating around Cupertino: space internet. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Apple has poached two high-level Alphabet executives that worked on satellite and spacecraft projects for Google, John Fenwick and Michael Trela. Trela served as Google's head of satellite engineering from August 2014 to March 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. Fenwick was Google's head of spacecraft operations over the same time frame, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither executive's profile has been updated to mention Apple. Image source: Getty Images. The report notes that aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) has expressed interest in pursuing space internet with a network of 1,000 satellites, saying that Boeing has held talks with Apple as a potential investor and partner. Apple may in fact be helping fund the project, according to Bloomberg, citing a blog post from satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, but Apple's involvement beyond that is unclear. Farrar wrote last month, ""Boeing has also indicated to these people that it does not need export credit funding for the project, which supports the idea that this project is backed by a deep pocketed US entity."" After ruling out other tech giants that have expressed extraterrestrial interest, Farrar concludes, ""That only leaves Apple as never having discussed publicly its potential interest in space."" Apple does have the deepest pockets of any company on Earth, after all. The business is currently built on launch contracts, but the internal information that was obtained shows that SpaceX has lofty ambitions for creating a satellite internet business within a matter of years, potentially starting as early as 2019. Image source: SpaceX. SpaceX's projections estimate that the service could garner 40 million subscribers and generate over $30 billion in revenue by 2025, according to the report. In contrast, the launch business is only expected to bring in $5 billion in sales that year, meaning that SpaceX believes that there's much more financial opportunity in beaming space internet down to Earth than launching reusable rockets. Operating income is forecast between $20 billion and $25 billion in 2025, which would largely be driven by the new business. The company had previously disclosed plans to launch over 4,400 satellites into low-Earth orbit to deliver low-latency internet from space, but had not mentioned financial expectations. People have been dreaming of space internet for over a decade, and there have been many casualties over the years. But as things tend to go in technology, things change rapidly over time, and that rate of change only accelerates. Falling costs have opened up the potential for a new wave of space entrepreneurs; start-up OneWeb raised $1.2 billion last year to build and launch a space internet network. It's entirely possible that Apple has something else in mind, but given the company's heavy emphasis on services in recent quarters, it seems conceivable that Apple sees potential in building a strong base of recurring revenue from a literal moonshot like space internet. However, even if you accept SpaceX's forecast, $30 billion still isn't a game changer on Apple's income statement, although it would be a welcome addition to the services segment (currently a $25 billion business). There would immense costs associated with building such a constellation, but the Mac maker is currently sitting on the most cash that it's ever had ($246 billion at last count, before factoring in debt). Space internet revenue also wouldn't have as high of margins compared to Apple's terrestrial services, given these costs. Still, I'm hoping that Apple one day announces ""the most extraterrestrial service we've ever made."" ","

The Social Security Administration (SSA) won't decide on an increase until it compares this year's full third-quarter inflation numbers to last year's third quarter numbers, but based on inflation data so far, recipients could end up getting a 1.7% bump up in their Social Security checks next year. The Social Security Administration determines whether or not to increase Social Security payments based on inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Image source: Getty Images. The BLS tracks the direction of prices for goods and services in the U.S., and while it uses various indexes to do this, the Social Security Administration uses the BLS' monthly consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) in its calculations. Specifically, the Social Security Administration averages the monthly CPI-W figures reported by the BLS during the third quarter, and then it compares that average to the monthly average from the last third quarter that resulted in a cost of living adjustment (COLA) increase. Since CPI-W didn't increase between the third quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015, there wasn't a COLA increase in 2016. Because there wasn't a COLA increase in 2016, but there was an increase in 2015, the Social Security Administration had to compare the third quarter of 2016 CPI-W figures to the third-quarter 2014 CPI-W figures in order to determine whether or not a COLA increase was necessary for 2017. That comparison resulted in a 0.3% increase in Social Security benefits this year. Since 1975, Social Security benefits have increased in all but three years, and the average COLA increase has been 3.8%. Since 2005, however, the average COLA increase has been 2.03%, and more recently, increases have been even smaller. In 2018, the increase may finally become more meaningful. The CPI-W has been increasing steadily this year, and as you can see in the following table, it's higher this quarter than it was in the third quarter of 2016. Averaging the monthly CPI-Ws for July and August and comparing them to last year shows that CPI-W is 1.79% higher in the third quarter this year. Data source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. If this year-over-year change in CPI-W remains the same through September, then Social Security recipients can expect to see their Social Security income increase by 1.79% in 2018. However, don't start planning how to spend that extra money just yet. Inflation could increase how much recipients pay for Medicare Part B coverage next year and since many Social Security recipients pay their Medicare bill directly from their Social Security income, a lot -- if not all -- of any COLA increase might end up going to Medicare instead of your wallet.

    Will You Get a Social Security Increase in 2018? -- The Motley Fool

"John Rosevear, Keith Speights, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Stocks to hold for 50 years? At first, that seems like an impossible request. We've all seen it in recent years: Even huge, great companies fade, get disrupted, or run aground on scandals or disasters of various kinds. But sometimes, you can tell that a company isn't just great now, it's built to be great for decades to come. With the caveat that nothing in the future is certain, our Foolish contributors think Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Eaton Corporation (NYSE:ETN) are good choices to add to a truly long-term portfolio. Alphabet's self-driving car company, Waymo, is just one of its many moon shots. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Keith Speights (Alphabet): If you didn't use Alphabet's Google nearly every day this week, you're probably one of the few in the developed world who didn't. Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine, Chrome browser, YouTube video site, and Android mobile operating system, which powers nearly 9 out of 10 smartphones. Why buy and hold Alphabet for the next 50 years? The company simply doesn't stop innovating. Innovation doesn't just apply to Alphabet's moon shot efforts. The company continues to improve its existing products, sometimes in ways that you don't even notice. (Those can be the best kinds of innovations, actually.) However, I admit to being intrigued by the moonshot programs. Alphabet's ""other bets"" business segment includes Calico, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Two of these initiatives are in the healthcare arena. Calico is focused on increasing the human lifespan, while Verily works on technology like developing glucose-sensing contact lenses for diabetic patients. Nest is developing home automation technology. Waymo is a pioneer in self-driving cars. And X focuses on a variety of projects including using a network of balloons to bring internet access to the two-thirds of the world's population that doesn't have it yet. While Alphabet pursues these incredibly cool ideas, its core businesses are generating revenue of more than $90 billion and earnings of $19.5 billion annually. Many of the company's moon shots won't pan out. But I suspect that some will. I also think that 50 years from now, Alphabet will still be innovating -- and still making investors a lot of money. John Rosevear (Amazon.com): Amazon hardly needs an introduction, but it always surprises me to find that many tech-savvy investors don't own any shares of the online-retail-and-more colossus. If you're one of those investors, it's time to reconsider. Yes, Amazon is already huge. Yes, its stock price is high. But it still has immense growth potential, and it genuinely has the cash-generation ability and management team to fully pursue that potential. Between Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition software (and the powerful artificial intelligence capabilities that underlie it), its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing empire, its incredibly dominant online-retail business, and the dozens of small bets that CEO Jeff Bezos seems to add every quarter... the upside here probably isn't limitless, but it's big. Twenty-plus years in, it's still seems like Amazon is just getting started. And while other companies will come and go, Amazon isn't going anywhere. It's got plenty of cash, management that is heavily invested, and good wide moats around its core businesses -- together, a recipe for profitable growth for decades to come. I own Amazon shares, and I suspect my sons will inherit them -- hopefully, many years from now. Reuben Gregg Brewer (Eaton): Global industrial giant Eaton Corp.'s sales have fallen in each of the last two years, buffeted by slow economic growth and currency volatility. However, the company managed to increase its operating margin in both years because of aggressive restructuring efforts. The bottom line, meanwhile, has held up relatively well (Eaton made $4.21 a share in 2016, down just $0.02 from 2015), and the dividend has been increased every year for the past seven years. Eaton's focus is on power management, which it covers through its electrical products, electrical systems and services, hydraulics, automotive, and aerospace segments. It has a long history of buying and selling businesses to adjust its portfolio over time. Its biggest recent deal was the 2012 acquisition of Cooper Industries, a $12 billion transaction that materially expanded its electrical operations. Tweaking businesses to get the most out of them, as highlighted above, is another ongoing focus. Essentially, Eaton is a pro at shifting with the changing times via acquisition and internal tweaks. In fact, it started its life over 100 years ago as an axle manufacturer, eventually selling that division in 1998 to focus on more lucrative operations. It's unlikely that you will ever find Eaton an exciting stock to own, but you can rest assured that it will deftly navigate the ups and downs of the business cycle over the next 50 years, transforming itself with the market as it goes. Meanwhile, you'll be rewarded with a nice 3.2% dividend yield that has a long history of increases behind it. ","

Echo far-field voice recognition technology will be available to outside developers. Image source: Amazon.com, Inc. One of the innovations that has made the Echo so successful is the far-field voice-recognition capabilities of the smart speaker. The seven-microphone circular array combines a number of technologies, including beamforming, noise reduction, echo cancellation, and voice processing, which allows the Echo to hear commands across a crowded room. As part of Amazon's vision for Alexa to be everywhere, the company is providing exclusive, invitation-only access to the technology behind its microphone array and voice processing and will allow third-party device makers to incorporate Echo's know-how into their own products. Through the Alexa Voice Service Program, Amazon is offering a hardware reference package that bundles the technology for use by partners and not charging for the privilege. If you think altruism is behind this gesture, think again. Consumers are able to access Amazon's music streaming service and make purchases on the e-commerce website using Alexa voice commands. Amazon also benefits by having the technology accessed by as many consumers as possible, as its AI-based voice recognition technology improves the more it is used. This isn't the first time Amazon has permitted the embedding of Alexa technology into other manufacturers' products. The company worked with a number of hardware developers beginning in June 2015 and has more than 40 partners, with products from speakers to smartwatches, and from cars to refrigerators. Amazon is also pursuing other avenues to make its voice service ubiquitous. The company just announced that it will make this technology available to its cloud-computing customers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) the company's cloud-computing service, will provide access to Amazon Lex, Alexa's AWS alter-ego, to create their own chat bots. These artificially intelligent software programs provide verbal or text interactions with consumers in a way that is designed to emulate a human being and are seen quite often in a messaging context. Google Home directly competes with Echo. Image source: Google. Amazon has been at a disadvantage in the virtual-assistant market, having missed out on the opportunity in mobile, as Alexa doesn't have a phone to call her own, like Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Assistant. This is the latest in a number of moves designed to establish a beachhead in the area of voice control. The company hopes to achieve an insurmountable installed base of devices to fend off competition from these other virtual assistants. Google's release of the Home smart speaker is the first direct competitor to the Echo, and Google has the advantage of its massive search capabilities and a foundation of millions of Android-based smartphones. While Apple hasn't announced its intention to produce a smart speaker, there have been unconfirmed reports that one is in development. Apple is known for coming late to market with a superior product and stealing market share, so it could take the same approach here. Meanwhile, the company has been hard at work integrating Siri across the breadth of Apple's devices. Not only can Siri be accessed on Apple's flagship iPhones, but it has also been enabled on the iMac, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air. In another moved designed to make Siri omnipresent, users can access her by giving two taps on one of Apple's branded AirPods. Amazon's advantage rests not only in being first to market with its device, but also in the multitude of Alexa commands or skills, numbering over 10,000. RBC Capital Market's Mark Mahaney and Jim Shaughnessy estimate that 17% of consumers have ordered products from Amazon's website using their Alexa-based device, which could result in an additional $10 billion in sales annually by 2020. Add to that an ever-increasing installed base of Alexa-enabled devices, and Amazon is one step closer to world domination. ","

Wendy Connick,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Social Security benefits are based on the amount of income you earned during your working life. So if you never had a paid job, or if you earned less than the minimum qualifying amount over your lifetime, does that mean you can never have Social Security benefits? Not necessarily -- thanks to the spousal benefits option. Once you hit age 62, if your spouse is currently receiving either retirement or disability benefits from Social Security, you too can receive benefits -- up to one-half your spouse's benefits (not including delayed-retirement credits). If you earn Social Security benefits on your own but the amount of your benefits is less than one-half your spouse's retirement benefits, you can receive additional spousal benefits to bring you up to the one-half limit. However, like standard Social Security benefits, spousal benefits do suffer from an early-retirement penalty. If you start taking the benefits as soon as you hit age 62, your benefit checks will be permanently reduced. The formula works as follows: If you retire and start claiming benefits one to 36 months before your full retirement age, your benefits will be reduced by roughly 5/9 of 1% per month you retired early. If you retire even earlier than 36 months before your full retirement age, your benefit will be reduced by 5/12 of 1% per month beyond the 36-month mark. ""Normal retirement age"" is calculated based on your birth date; if you were born after 1959, it's age 67. Image source: Getty Images. If your spouse has died, and he or she qualified for Social Security benefits, you can receive what are called survivors benefits. Survivors benefits are more generous than spousal benefits: If you wait until full retirement age to claim your benefits, you can get 100% of your deceased spouse's benefit amount. You can claim survivors benefits as early as age 60, but your benefits will be reduced by that pesky early-retirement penalty. If you're disabled, you can claim the benefits as early as age 50; again, the benefit amount would be permanently reduced for claiming the benefits that early.  If you qualify for survivors benefits, you may also be eligible for a lump-sum death payment of $255. Claiming spousal benefits can be done through the same application process as claiming standard Social Security benefits. In fact, if you apply for Social Security benefits at the same time as your spouse, or if your spouse is already receiving benefits when you apply, the Social Security Administration will automatically check to see if you are eligible for spousal benefits and will sign you up for said benefits if you are. Applying for survivors benefits is a little more complicated. Unlike standard and spousal Social Security benefits, you can't apply for survivors benefits online. You'll need to call Social Security and request an appointment to start the application process. However, if you're already receiving spousal benefits at the time your spouse dies, you will automatically be switched over to survivors benefits -- which means your benefits will likely increase significantly.

Sean Williams,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of large gold-mining company Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) hit the smelter this afternoon and lost as much as 11% after the company reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Monday. As you can probably surmise by the move, Barrick widely missed the mark and disappointed Wall Street with its guidance. For the quarter, Barrick Gold reported 1.31 million ounces of gold production, which, with other byproducts included, yielded $1.99 billion in revenue and $495 million in operating cash flow. On a bottom-line basis, Barrick Gold generated $162 million in adjusted income, or $0.14 per share. By comparison, Wall Street had been looking for Barrick Gold to generate $230 million more in revenue and EPS of $0.21 per share. Image source: Getty Images. Why the wide miss? Barrick Gold attributed higher direct mining costs, higher exploration and development expenses, and higher depreciation for its subpar adjusted earnings per share in Q1. Its production was also affected by adverse weather conditions at its Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. Looking ahead, Barrick disappointed with its forecast. The company updated its full-year guidance to 5.3 million to 5.6 million gold ounces of production, which is down from its previous guidance of 5.6 million to 5.9 million ounces of gold. It should be noted that 200,000 ounces of this 300,000-ounce dip at the midpoint is from the sale of 50% of Veladero to Shandong Gold for $960 million. Still, this suggests that around 100,000 ounces of production is being slashed from Barrick's existing mines. The good news, though, is that the company stood pat on its all-in sustaining cost (AISC) guidance of $720 to $770 per gold ounce, and it reduced its total debt by another $178 million. Image source: Getty Images. Barrick Gold's quarterly results clearly weren't what Wall Street was looking for, but I'd also opine that the 11% move lower in the company's share price could be a major overreaction. Let's consider a couple of important facts about Barrick. Long story short, Barrick faced some weather-related challenges and sold off half of a key mine this quarter, but overall, this wasn't a bad quarter. It continues to pay down debt, maintained its leading AISC, and remains healthfully profitable with a prudent budget. Gold investors would be wise to get Barrick Gold on their radars after today's drop. ","

                                    earnings fell short of expectations largely due to tax charges, including one charge tied to its stock-based compensation plan that shaved roughly 83 cents a share off non-GAAP earnings. While announcing those results, Alphabet execs announced the company will begin to emphasize GAAP earnings as opposed to non-GAAP, which allow companies to use accounting gymnastics to exclude stock- based compensation and one-time charges that may have been incurred during the quarter. Read Also:  The tax hit that made Google miss on earnings, and the big change that will keep it from happening again On the company’s earnings call in January, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a Wall Street veteran who previously led the finance department at Morgan Stanley, said the company was changing its accounting metrics because it no longer wanted to exclude stock-based compensation, or SBC, from its results. Alphabet will still break down stock-based compensation on its cash flow statement for investors who prefer to look at results without it, but the company will present the GAAP figure as its main earnings result. “Although it’s not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world,” Porat said. MarketWatch has been covering the complicated world of GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings for years. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has promised to start cracking down on made-up numbers this year, though many companies still rely on non-GAAP results. Also See:  How investors are duped each earnings season Alphabet’s results for the second quarter will be closely watched for any negative results from a controversy for YouTube, which saw advertisers pull spending after news reports showed ads running on objectionable videos. Any effects may be hard to spot, however, as Google’s results for search and other advertising are combined with YouTube results, which have never been presented separately. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report GAAP earnings per share of $7.38, compared with $7.50 in the year-earlier period. Adjusted for one-time items that occurred during the quarter, the non-GAAP metric Alphabet has focused on in the past, analysts are calling for earnings of $9.41 a share. Estimize, a software platform that pools together estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expects Alphabet to report earnings $7.76 a share. The Estimize number is usually closer to the FactSet non-GAAP number, but this quarter is different because it reflects a wide spectrum of contributors who may be issuing a mix of forecasts based on Google’s previous and newer financial reporting standards. Estimize Chief Executive Leigh Drogen told MarketWatch that the platform’s algorithms are offsetting that by overweighting the newer estimates, but the old estimates are still skewing it. Alphabet missed both the FactSet and Estimize consensus earnings estimates last quarter, but surpassed them in the two prior quarters. Revenue: Alphabet is expected to report revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $19.8 billion, compared with $16.5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Estimize contributors predict Alphabet sales of $19.8 billion. Alphabet topped both estimates in each of the past three quarters, and analysts continue to be optimistic about advertising trends despite the YouTube controversy. The Google division of Alphabet is dominated by advertising revenues, though the development of its “other revenues,” which include hardware sales like the Pixel smartphone and Google Play Store revenue, will be interesting to watch after 62% growth last quarter. Alphabet also breaks out “other bets,” a segment that includes its experimental lines of businesses.

Last week, Credit Suisse reiterated a $1,100 target and outperform rating on the stock and said investors may be underestimating the potential benefits of its newer business lines, such as YouTube TV, Google Play and the cloud. Read: Alphabet’s stock may finally outperform Facebook and Amazon The average analyst rating is the equivalent to buy, according to a FactSet survey of more than 30 analysts, who have an average price target of $982.26. Shares closed at $889.14 on Wednesday. What to watch for: Analysts have been forecasting an in-line quarter for Google, though some have warned that profit growth may be impacted in the near term as the company invests heavily in newer initiatives. The company’s fast-growing newer lines of business continue to take a bigger piece of the overall revenue pie as Google’s core search business decelerates. Last quarter, Google’s websites business raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, accounting for 85% of total sales. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju expects its other businesses to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years. Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves, whose overweight rating and $1,040 price target make him one of the most bullish analysts covering Alphabet on Wall Street, told clients this week that recent conversations with advertisers reinforced his confidence in Google’s search advertising business. The advertisers eased his concerns about YouTube advertising, while Google’s efforts in the cloud “seem to be showing some signs of progress,” he wrote. Despite a boycott on Google’s YouTube ads last quarter that some analysts feared would cut into its first-quarter sales, MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson said he expects a “negligible impact.” But expect questions about this from analysts on the conference call and additional insight into Google’s plans to provide more advanced and transparent video metrics starting next quarter. ",Google earnings: A new approach arrives amid YouTube ad controversy - MarketWatch
 ,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Supported by By David Streitfeld The day is still distant when you can actually own a self-driving car, but in certain parts of the Phoenix area, hundreds of people will soon be integrating one into their daily lives. Waymo, the self-driving-car outfit spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been putting millions of miles on its autonomous cars in various cities for years. On Tuesday, the company was to announce the next phase of testing: putting ordinary people inside its Chrysler minivans and Lexuses. Those accepted into the program, which has already begun quietly operating, will summon a car with an app and then go about their business. They will be encouraged to use the vehicles to go anywhere they would normally go at any hour — the office, the movies, the supermarket, even a late-night search for ice cream. Waymo is not charging those involved in the trial. It says it is casting a broad net for all types of people in an effort to accumulate reams of data about how driverless cars will be used in practice and not just in theory. “We’ve given 10,000 rides internally, but if you’re just providing experiences to folks inside the company, you’re missing the broader range of diversity,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive, said. The application, on the Waymo website, is relatively brief. It asks for an address, the members of a household and a reason for applying. Choices include: “I think the technology is awesome,” “I want more time and resources back during my commute,” and “I dislike driving and think a self-driving car would be safer.” Applicants are not allowed to select “all of the above.” Only those who live in Chandler, Mesa, Tempe and Gilbert — roughly the southeastern Phoenix area — will be eligible for the program. And the cars, for that matter, will not take them anywhere else — no weekend jaunts to the Grand Canyon. Waymo, which has cautiously expanded the testing of its autonomous vehicles, did not give a specific number of people it hopes to enroll in the program beyond saying it would be in the hundreds. The company is adding 500 specially outfitted Chrysler minivans to its self-driving fleet, up from 100 now. Many of the minivans are destined for Phoenix. Uber, the ride-hailing company that is Waymo’s biggest and bitterest competitor, began deploying self-driving cars in September in Pittsburgh. In December, it expanded the testing to San Francisco, but the city forced it to stop because its permits were not in order. Uber moved to Tempe, Ariz., before it began testing again in San Francisco. Self-driving cars have evolved rapidly, with plenty of accompanying drama, but there are many miles to go. All the Waymo cars will have a technician who can take control in an emergency. Waymo is also doing testing in the San Francisco Bay Area, near Seattle and in Austin. It has been working closely with Fiat Chrysler, leading to speculation they will jointly form a ride-hailing service that will compete directly with Uber. “We’re not about building better cars; we’re about building better drivers,” Mr. Krafcik said. In February, Waymo sued Uber in federal court, claiming the company was using self-driving car technology stolen by Anthony Levandowski, a former employee. But Uber says it started developing the component — called lidar, for light detection and ranging sensors — before it acquired Otto, a company created by Mr. Levandowski, who now runs Uber’s self-driving car effort. Waymo has asked the court to file an order halting Uber’s self-driving car work with an injunction. Several months before filing its suit against Uber, Google also demanded arbitration against Mr. Levandowski, claiming he had used confidential salary information while trying to poach former colleagues to his new venture. It is not clear if the arbitration was settled. Uber is arguing that the Waymo suit should also be decided in arbitration because the claims stem from Mr. Levandowski’s time at Google and are covered by an arbitration clause in his employment contract.

Waymo has been testing its vans and Lexus sport-utility vehicles with employees in Arizona, California, Oregon and Texas. Waymo said that, starting Tuesday, it will begin accepting applications through its website from people who want to be part of the Early Rider program. It isn’t clear when people will begin riding in the vans. In greater Phoenix, Waymo will test the cars in an area that is twice the size of San Francisco, including in the suburbs of Chandler and Tempe. Users can summon the vehicles with a special app at any time of the day. A safety operator will be behind the wheel in case human hands need to take over as is the case with other test vehicle programs around the country. The vehicles will have steering wheels and brakes. An expanded version of this article appears on WSJ.com.

Paul Gillin UPDATED 00:31 EST . 25 APRIL 2017 Four of the tech industry’s giants will report earnings results today, hoping cloud computing will boost their fortunes. Early earnings reports for the first calendar quarter provided some signs that the cloud is helping some tech stalwarts. IBM Corp. saw its shares fall last week on yet another quarterly revenue decline, but cloud growth was strong. And on Tuesday, SAP’s shares waffled as it fell short on profits but it turned in strong cloud subscription revenue. There’s not a lot of room for error from investors’ point of view. Even though share prices modestly declined the first half of April, technology shares are still up an average of 10 percent in 2017, compared with 4 percent for the overall market. Among the four major companies reporting Thursday, Amazon.com Inc. hit a peak of 20 percent above its year-end close. Google Inc. parent Alphabet Inc. climbed 8 percent and Microsoft Corp. was up 5 percent. Only Intel Corp. has declined. Experts say the recent run-up has been fueled by investors who are seeking growth now that hopes have dimmed for near-term big tax cuts or infrastructure spending by the new administration. That prospect had driven price-to-earnings multiples for some companies into the stratosphere. Amazon’s P/E ratio, for instance, is 180. One thing likely will emerge from the first-quarter performance: Leaders in mobility and the cloud are in favor. “The ongoing movement toward cloud services is not only being fueled by the mainstream acceptance of these on-demand alternatives, but also by the continued economic uncertainties facing companies in an increasingly volatile global environment,” said Jeff Kaplan, managing director at THINKstrategies Inc., a cloud consulting firm. Here’s the outlook for companies reporting later Thursday afternoon: Ralph Finos, an analyst with Wikibon, owned by the same company as SiliconANGLE, expects Amazon to report $3.74 billion in quarterly revenue from its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, up 46 percent from the same quarter last year. Analysts are estimating overall quarterly earnings per share will be about $1.13. In recent quarters, virtually all of Amazon’s operating profits have come from AWS. Finos thinks No. 2 cloud player Microsoft will grow its Intelligent Cloud business about 9 percent to $6.45 billion and the Azure infrastructure-as a service business between 90 and 100 percent. In handily beating sales and earnings estimates in the most recent quarter, Microsoft reported 95 percent growth in its Azure business, with Office 365 successfully baiting the hook for many enterprises to move cloudward. Analysts are looking for a 69-cent EPS in the quarter. Cloud computing remains a tiny portion of revenue for Alphabet despite Google’s accelerating focus on new cloud services and infrastructure spending since at least 2015. Investors will certainly have questions about its cloud operation, mostly how much Google is spending to build it up. But shares no doubt will turn more on how its massive advertising business performs. Analyst are looking for profits of $7.40 a share on a 20 percent jump in revenue, to $24.2 billion. Intel is in transition as it sheds no-growth business such as security and places big bets on nascent markets such as autonomous vehicles. Investor expectations are modest as a result. Analysts expect Intel to report quarterly revenue of $14.81 billion, up about 7 percent. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he’ll be looking for statements about how Intel is coping with new competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He’ll also be listening for news of whether a modest revival in PC sales is trickling down to the bottom line and when investors should expect to see results of recently announced artificial intelligence and cloud initiatives.

New York Post,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Published: Apr 20, 2017 1:53 p.m. ET By Tin-foil hats might not protect you from this threat. Audio giant Bose has been spying on customers that use its wireless headphones via an app that tracks the music, podcasts and other audio they listen to, a lawsuit charged. Bose, in turn, has been violating customers’ privacy rights by selling their info without permission, according to the federal suit filed Tuesday in Chicago. The complaint filed by Kyle Zak seeks an injunction to stop Bose’s “wholesale disregard” for the privacy of customers who download its free Bose Connect app from Apple or Google Play stores to their smartphones. “People should be uncomfortable with it,” Christopher Dore, a lawyer representing Zak, said in an interview. “People put headphones on their head because they think it’s private, but they can be giving out information they don’t want to share.” Bose did not respond on Wednesday to requests for comment on the proposed class action. The Framingham, Mass.–based company has said annual sales top $3.5 billion. Zak is seeking millions of dollars of damages for buyers of headphones and speakers, including QuietComfort 35, QuietControl 30, SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II, SoundLink Color II, SoundSport Wireless and SoundSport Pulse Wireless. He also wants a halt to the data collection, which he said violates the federal Wiretap Act and Illinois laws against eavesdropping and consumer fraud. Dore, a partner at Edelson PC, said customers do not see the Bose app’s user service and privacy agreements when signing up, and the privacy agreement says nothing about data collection.

                                   said it continues to expect cash flow to be negative and is uncertain as to whether it will be able to refinance or extend the maturities of some of its borrowings, according to a regulatory filing. The company has almost $350 million of debt coming due this year, part of a massive $20 billion debt load it took on as part of a $24 billion leveraged buyout of then Clear Channel Communications Inc. by private-equity firms Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2008. It has another $8.3 billion of debt coming due in 2019. “Management anticipates that our financial statements to be issued for the three months ended March 31, 2017, will include disclosure indicating there will be substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months following the date the first quarter 2017 financial statements are issued,” the company said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. iHeart’s most active bonds, the 9.00% notes that mature in March of 2021, traded down 2 points to 75 cents on the dollar on Friday, according to MarketAxess. Its 6.875% notes due in June of 2018 were trading at 69 cents on the dollar. Moody’s Investors Service said an exchange offer in March, in which iHeart swapped $476 million of senior unsecured notes due 2018 for senior secured priority guarantee notes due 2021, was a continuation of iHeart’s distressed exchange. As for its stock, shares on Friday fell 3%. The rating agency had revised the outlook on iHeart’s ratings to negative from stable in December, suggesting it might further downgrade its already deep into junk Caa2 rating in the medium term. Moody’s said at the time it expected iHeart would be forced into a debt restructuring in the next year. The company attempted in April to persuade its creditors to accept a series of exchange offers that would allow it to refinance more than $14 billion of term loans and other debt, offering new debt, equity and ownership in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. After its lenders failed to take up that offer, the company extended the deadline to late April.

Revenue fell 2.4% in the first quarter to $1.33 billion, while expenses rose 3%, according to the SEC filing. Operating income fell 73% to $114 million. As of March 1, the company had $365 million of cash on its balance sheet, including $220.6 million of cash held by Clear Channel Outdoor. Pittman, who is widely regarded as a marketing genius, took over as CEO in 2011, and immediately embarked on a series of moves aimed at positioning iHeart as a modern tech company with a bright future. In one instance, he redesigned the company’s New York headquarters into a “Kubrickian spaceship,” as Variety magazine described it, complete with laser displays, modular fiberglass pods and a tunnel with video images projected into streams of mist. Pittman brought in a new management team and embarked on a campaign of promotional events, including the iHeart concert series, the iHeart Radio Music Awards and lavish parties at the annual ad-industry event, Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. iHeart posted a net loss of $240 million in 2016, after a net loss of $737 million in the year-earlier period. ”The bottom line is you have to have a profit and you have to have sufficient cash flow to function as a company,” said Tatelbaum. iHeart shares closed down 4.8%.

Jacob Passy,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Published: Apr 23, 2017 2:55 p.m. ET The Digit app has given its members 100 days to stay and pay, or go By What should you do when a once-free personal finance app starts charging you? That’s the question many users of the popular money-saving app Digit are now facing. Last week, the company announced that it would begin charging users a $2.99 fee per month from April 11. Digit is giving users a 100-day free trial to decide whether or not to stay with a service. If a current Digit user closes an account after that time, they will receive a refund if they weren’t aware of the change. “It’s not Digit’s intention to charge people who weren’t aware of the change — they aim to make this as transparent as possible,” a company spokeswoman said. Here’s how it works: The app stashes away income in a savings account using an algorithm that judges a consumer’s earning and spending habits. (The company would not comment on how many users it had before (or after) the change.) The San Francisco-based company has also said it will raise the “savings bonus” that users receive every three months for using the app to 1% from 0.20%, among other planned improvements. Still, these added features and the free trial have not won over many Digit customers who now plan to withdraw their funds. Scores took to social media to blast the plan. (Digit’s spokeswoman noted that the company “expected some fallout” from the decision.) So why not introduce a premium service instead of charging EVERYONE? Now, I have to quit you altogether. Bye Digit! @hellodigit Among those who plan to stop using the app is Veronica Richter, a 25-year-old marketing professional from Boston. Richter first downloaded Digit in January 2016 and used it to create a so-called “fun fund.” Recently, she began using another free app called EveryDollar that helps consumers budget for goals and expenses. So now, Richter plans to replicate what Digit did with her money with EveryDollar. “I could probably calculate how much I’m putting away via Digit and just keep that money consistently,” Richter said. “So I still have a fun fund, but I manage it myself.” Competitors have gotten in on the act, too, using Digit’s announcement as a marketing opportunity. Savings app Qapital tweeted out suggestions of things consumers could buy with $2.99 with the hashtag #KeepSavingFree. To generate revenue, Qapital chose a different strategy: It will introduce its “Smart Spending” program later this year, and will earn money when consumers use its debit card. “We think that there are other ways to monetize these apps over time that are much more in line with customers’ expectations,” George Friedman, Qapital’s founder and chief executive, said.

The company tweeted that those who switch from Digit would receive double “round-up bonuses” for 12 weeks — the company rounds up each purchase made with its bank card to the nearest dollar and deposits that money in a savings account as part of its offerings.

                                   according to Chime co-founder and CEO Chris Britt. “It’s very clear that consumers are frustrated with their bank — that starts with a bank account that doesn’t charge any fees,” Britt said. While some consumers are obviously frustrated by Digit’s change, it could benefit them in the long-run. For starters, the shift (and the response to it) points to the growing competition among these apps. “If other companies come in and offer a cheaper way of saving, that’s actually great for the market because then we have competition,” said Ryan Falvey, managing director of the Financial Solutions Lab at the Center for Financial Services Innovation. See also: These families are doing more saving than their bank balances suggest Just because Digit now charges a monthly fee doesn’t mean that the value it provides is completely eroded. Priya Malani, co-founder of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based financial planning firm Stash Wealth, said many of her clients “are raving fans of Digit,” and countered that its new fee-based model wouldn’t deter her from recommending the app. Digit uses text messages and other incentives to encourage users to save more (and to hold onto those savings.) In total, the company said its customers have saved $500 million, which works out roughly to between $80 and $170 a month for average users. People who are incentivized to save with Digit who may not do so otherwise could still come out ahead, given that the charges only add up to $36 per year, Malani said. “There is something to say about it being a small price to pay for a huge reward,” she added. Trial-and-error becomes important here. Tyler Dolan, a certified financial planner with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.’s financial education venture Society of Grownups, emphasized doing a cost-benefit analysis when it comes to Digit — or any other savings app. “If I use that free trial and see Digit found me $100 to save on a monthly basis, at that point I would say this is expensive,” Dolan said. Malani similarly suggested people could try out different apps if they are unhappy with Digit’s new fees and return to Digit if it provided them better savings. Whether a Digit user chooses to stay with the app or switch to another startup savings service, consumers may want to approach these financial technology companies with a certain degree of caution. The experience with Digit is indicative of the constantly-changing environment that fintech apps (and their users) find themselves in. If Digit is successful in retaining customers, other companies could follow suit, Malani said. And as more of these apps grow, they will have to address similar questions regarding their long-term strategy and profitability. “I expect this to be the case for the next few years, and then I expect there to be a whole lot of consolidation,” Malani said. Don’t miss: Every Trump tweet activates thousands of computer algorithms Users of apps that merge with each other or are bought by larger companies will face similar quandaries to Digit’s customers’ today. Before Digit, Boston-based software engineer Joel Greenberg used an app called ImpulseSave. The app scanned items’ barcodes in stores and would deposit the amount they cost into a savings account for the customer, so they saved money rather than spending it. After ImpulseSave was acquired by Betterment in 2013, Greenberg stopped using it. He said he also plans to cash out his savings from Digit and may look instead to a more traditional option such as opening an account with a robo-advisor like Wealthfront or a wealth management firm like Fidelity Investments. “I’ve had the same experience now with two apps,” Greenberg said. “That tells me that maybe I need to go a more conventional route.” ","When this savings app rolled out a monthly fee for its services, customers revolted - MarketWatch"

                                    shares haven’t popped on the news either, falling 3% in Friday trading. Susquehanna called the results “mostly as expected,” with international wholesale and retail results having a solid showing but “stagnant growth” on the domestic front. “Skechers must essentially hit a home run in its new product lines in order to avoid being ‘crowded out’ at key domestic wholesale accounts,” analysts there wrote in a Thursday note. “It’s too early to tell if Skechers’ new products will resonate to the degree needed.” Among its new lines, the company on Monday announced the launch of its You by Skechers women’s lifestyle line. Read also: The retail sector is shedding jobs like it’s a recession Skechers reported earnings per share of 60 cents, sliding from 63 cents last year but beating the 54-cent FactSet consensus. The decline was attributed to a “higher international pretax income in lower foreign tax jurisdictions,” said chief financial officer David Weinberg on the late-Thursday earnings call. Sales were $1.07 billion for the quarter, up from $978.8 million last year and more than the $1.06 billion FactSet consensus. The international wholesale business was up 16.8% and the company’s global retail business was up 12.8%. However, Weinberg described the domestic wholesale business as “relatively flat.” The company shipped 4.5% more pairs of shoes year over year, but the average price per pair was down 4.8%, or about $1.10 per pair. “This is due to the shift in product mix, including strong sales in our sandals and casual lines and Bobs from Skechers,” he said. “While we are cautious due to the closing of numerous stores in 2016 and again in the first quarter of 2017, we remain optimistic and poised to move quickly to fulfill consumer demands in our dedicated wholesale accounts.” For Susquehanna, the future is unclear, with the calendar putting them in “wait-and-see” mode. For instance, Easter was late this year. Another issue is whether Skechers is getting priority from stores. “In other words, unless Skechers product performs exceptionally well, Skechers’ wholesale partners will not allocate open-to-buy to Skechers at the expense of funding Adidas

Hannah Furfaro,04272017,MarketWatch,04202017,"Published: Apr 24, 2017 10:35 a.m. ET See which cities have the most trees By Cities that want to plant more trees along their streets have a new planning tool at their disposal. It’s called Treepedia, an online tool that analyzes millions of neighborhood photos from Google Street View to create block-by-block maps of cities around the world showing where there are trees and where streets are bare. Treepedia, launched by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Senseable City Lab in December, so far has created tree maps of 19 cities across five continents, from New York to São Paulo, Paris, Singapore and Sydney. It doesn’t yet cover any city in Africa. Users can look at an overview of each city dotted in shades of brown and green to show where trees are few or frequent, and they can zoom in to see ground-level images if they want to see exactly which blocks need greening. “Street greenery is a really important part of the urban environment,” says Xiaojiang Li, a postdoctoral fellow at MIT who helped develop Treepedia’s Green View Index, a measure of the tree coverage in a city overall and in any area within the city that a user wants to examine. Trees provide shade for pedestrians in the summer and help to lower urban temperatures, Li says. They also help prevent water runoff during heavy rain and clean the air. The MIT team used the Google

                                   photos instead of satellite imagery to “really measure how much greenery people might see” as they move around a city’s streets, Li says. Treepedia’s Green View Index doesn’t take city parks into account for that same reason. That’s partly why Paris ranks lowest for tree coverage among the cities mapped so far despite its many large parks. The median index score for the city’s streets is just 8.8%. Singapore has the highest median index score so far, at 29.3%, and Sydney and Vancouver are the only other cities with scores above 25%. Of the six U.S. cities that have been mapped, Sacramento, Calif., has the highest median index score, at 23.6%, followed by Seattle at 20% and then Miami at 19.4%. Boston scored 18.2%, Los Angeles 15.2% and New York 13.5%. Miami is one example of a city that has made growing more trees in its metropolitan area a priority, in its case focusing on storm-resilient species to limit the damage from hurricanes and other severe weather. To boost its effort, the city now requires developers who remove trees during building construction to pay into a city trust fund, money that’s used in part to plant new trees. The project has gained momentum as the city has educated developers, the public and its own departments about the importance of trees, says Luciana Gonzalez, assistant director for Miami’s planning and zoning department. But she says, while the city has yet to formally evaluate how it could put Treepedia to use, she believes it “would help us tremendously” because Miami doesn’t have the resources to do the kind of detailed data collection on its own that the tool provides. If that lack of resources is a problem for cities in the richest countries, it is even more so for those in the developing world. Treepedia may help level the playing field in that regard as it continues to map cities around the world, says Alice Charles, leader of the World Economic Forum’s Cities and Urban Development team, who helped develop the Treepedia concept.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company’s determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google’s Chromebook is now the computer of choice. The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users. In 2016, mobile devices running Alphabet Inc’s Google’s Chrome operating system accounted for 58 percent of the U.S. market for primary and secondary schools, according to Futuresource Consulting. The Microsoft products introduced Tuesday, including a new version of its Windows operating system, software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say. “The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,” said Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of Clever, an education technology company. “There’s so much investment into the space – it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.” For years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators. But the Chromebook’s low price—it starts at $149— and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the United States. To capitalize on the opportunity, the company created a “test mode,” which restricts access to the rest of the web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google. The preparations paid off: Sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, Sheth said. While Google manufactures some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Acer Inc. The operating system is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package including device management and support for a $30 fee. For Microsoft, Tuesday’s event was the culmination of a campaign to emulate key aspects of the Chromebook strategy, said Mike Fisher, associate director for the education division at Futuresource Consulting. Microsoft’s hardware partners are now selling hybrid tablet-laptop devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the operating system announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook. The company also introduced a new code-builder addition to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game. For Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, Fisher said. “The Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,” he said. “With Microsoft, there’s a lot of moving parts.” Microsoft declined to comment. Apple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices, in addition to simplifying management. “It’s about trying to reach every teacher and every student,” said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple. Despite Google’s U.S. dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, where many markets have not yet seen an impetus to embrace technology en masse, said Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. In 2016, devices running Android and Chrome made up 23 percent of the mobile market outside the United States, compared with 65 percent for Microsoft’s Windows, according to Futuresource. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5.43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large. “For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2.8 percent to $916.80 after the bell on Thursday. “It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61.6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60.6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said. “Our great properties — like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play — are the ‘prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google's revenue rose 22.2 percent to $24.75 billion from $20.26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. (bit.ly/2qbMJGY) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29.7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5.43 billion, or $7.73 per share, from $4.21 billion, or $6.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a first-quarter profit of $7.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that “YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service. YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager. Google’s non-advertising revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49.4 percent to $3.10 billion. “We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business,” Pichai said. The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. “We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. “That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s “Other Bets”—separate business units including the Waymo self-driving car business, Google Fiber, thermostat-maker Nest and the life sciences firm Verily—continued to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the year-ago quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the year-ago quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the two-year-old Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company. “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.” ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"Google said on Wednesday that it had taken steps to protect users from the attacks by disabling offending accounts and removing malicious pages. The attack used a relatively novel approach to phishing, a hacking technique designed to trick users into giving away sensitive information, by gaining access to user accounts without needing to obtain their passwords. They did that by getting an already logged-in user to grant access to a malicious application posing as Google Docs. “This is the future of phishing,” said Aaron Higbee, chief technology officer at PhishMe Inc. “It gets attackers to their goal ... without having to go through the pain of putting malware on a device.” He said the hackers had also pointed some users to another site, since taken down, that sought to capture their passwords. Google said its abuse team “is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” Anybody who granted access to the malicious app unknowingly also gave hackers access to their Google account data including emails, contacts and online documents, according to security experts who reviewed the scheme. “This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,” said Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Cappos said he received seven of those malicious emails in three hours on Wednesday afternoon, an indication that the hackers were using an automated system to perpetuate the attacks. He said he did not know the objective, but noted that compromised accounts could be used to reset passwords for online banking accounts or provide access to sensitive financial and personal data. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"MILAN (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s  Google has agreed to pay 306 million euros ($334 million) to settle a tax dispute with Italy, the company and the country’s tax authority said on Thursday. Last year Italian tax police alleged that Google had not paid tax on about 1 billion euros of Italian revenue between 2009 and 2013. “In addition to the taxes already paid in Italy during those years, Google will pay another 306 million euros,” a spokeswoman for the U.S. company said in an email. Both Google and the Italian tax office said the agreement covered the years between 2002 and 2015. Alphabet has been accused in Italy and other countries of avoiding taxes by booking income earned in higher-taxing European markets through a unit based in low-tax Ireland. The U.S. company has previously said it complied with tax rules in every country it worked. In a separate statement on Thursday the Italian tax office said the amount of more than 306 million euros which Google would pay was referenced to both Google Italy and Google Ireland units. “With Google a process will be kicked off to come up with preventive agreements for correct taxation in Italy in the future for operations that regard our country,” the tax office said.

In December, it said it was pursuing seven global businesses over A$2 billion ($1.50 billion) in unpaid tax. While the ATO has not named the businesses it is pursuing, Google’s Australia unit said in accounts filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission that it will “lodge an objection” to the tax demand from the ATO. “The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims,” Google said in the financial statement released on Friday. The search giant did not disclose how much the ATO has demanded it pay in taxes. Google and the ATO declined to comment on how much the company’s amended tax bill was. Treasurer Scott Morrison said in April the country expected to claw back A$2.9 billion from companies under the legislation. Australia enacted the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law in December 2015 and the ATO has introduced new guidelines for foreign trading hubs. Google Australia restructured its operations effective January 1 of last year to comply with the legislation and its financial statement reveals an increase in revenue and tax for the 2016 calendar year as a result. Revenue surged to A$1.14 billion in 2016 from A$498 million in 2015, while total income tax rose to A$16 million from A$2.8 million in 2015, the accounts show. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the   nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"Google announced a deal with Yandex and Russia’s competition watchdog on April 17, pledging to stop requiring manufacturers of Android-based devices to pre-install its search engine and other applications. Yandex expects the settlement to “open the door to market share gains on mobile (devices) in 2017 and beyond,” Chief Executive Arkady Volozh said in a statement. Yandex is the largest internet search engine in Russia, but has struggled to increase its share of this market on mobile devices, most of which use Android. The company’s overall share of the Russian search market, including mobile, was flat quarter on quarter at 55.4 percent but down from 57.6 percent a year earlier. Yandex said on a conference call on Thursday that the Android case settlement’s impact on the company’s market share would be skewed to the second half of the year. The company now expects 2017 revenue growth of between 17 and 20 percent, having predicted in February a rise of 16-19 percent. First-quarter revenue jumped 25 percent. The company also said its cash pile stood at 61.4 billion roubles ($1.08 billion) as of March 31. Yandex said in February it did not rule out that its board of directors could discuss the possibility of a maiden dividend payout at one of its meetings this year. “Clearly we do see an increasing confidence about the overall economic backdrop,” Greg Abovsky, Yandex chief financial officer, told a conference call when asked about the prospect of a dividend payout. “We do believe that we are in a better position, we have a strong balance sheet and we’ve just hedged out two years worth of office lease expense so I think the board will feel more confident about making a cash distribution decision now than it has before,” Abovsky said. The company increased adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by 19 percent in the first quarter to 6.9 billion roubles on 20.7 billion roubles of sales. Net income was down 23 percent to 0.8 billion roubles due to a 2.2 billion rouble foreign exchange loss, while adjusted net income rose 18 percent to 3.7 billion roubles. It said online advertising revenues grew 23 percent, adding that its online taxi booking service was a major growth driver with sales up 75 percent. Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up 5.8 percent in early trade on Thursday at $26.30. ($1 = 57.0386 roubles) ","

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s growth into a digital advertising power is showing a flip side: The social network is more dependent than ever on the cyclical ad market, even as its rival Google finds new revenue streams in hardware and software. Facebook reported on Wednesday that 98 percent of its quarterly revenue came from advertising, up from 97 percent a year earlier and 84 percent in 2012. Revenue from non-advertising sources fell to $175 million in the quarter, from $181 million a year earlier. Facebook has warned for some time about declining non-ad revenue. That part of its business consists almost entirely of video game players on desktop computers buying virtual currency, and it has fallen as gaming has moved to smartphones. Facebook takes 30 percent of purchases, with the balance going to companies such as Zynga Inc, maker of the game Farmville. The company’s dependence on advertising is a long-term concern but it has time to find other revenue while building its core ad business, said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. “We have to remember it’s still a fairly young business. It’s not like they’re an old-fashioned business that needs to move soon,” he said. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment. Facebook’s share price hit an all-time high of $153.60 on Tuesday before dipping to close at $150.85 on Thursday. The lack of diversification stands in contrast to Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. Its non-advertising revenue, from sources such as cloud services and Pixel smartphones, posted a 49.4 percent jump to $3.1 billion in the most recent quarter and now represents 13 percent of Google’s total revenue, up from 10 percent a year earlier. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during a conference call in February that the company was diversifying  revenue by expanding its base of advertisers across geographic regions and industries. Facebook’s non-advertising products, such as its Oculus virtual reality headset and the Workplace office software, currently generate little revenue. Some companies diversify through acquisitions, but most of Facebook’s purchases such as Instagram and WhatsApp have been in adjacent markets. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said in a conference call for investors on Wednesday that Facebook was not breaking out Instagram revenue as a separate line in financial reports because Instagram ads are sold through the same interface as Facebook ads.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Islamic State militants are developing their own social media platform to avoid security crackdowns on their communications and propaganda, the head of the European Union’s police agency said on Wednesday. Europol Director Rob Wainwright said the new online platform had been uncovered during a 48-hour operation against Internet extremism last week. “Within that operation it was revealed IS was now developing its very own social media platform, its own part of the Internet to run its agenda,” Wainwright told a security conference in London. “It does show that some members of Daesh (IS), at least, continue to innovate in this space.” During a Europol-coordinated crackdown on IS and al Qaeda material, which involved officials from the United States, Belgium, Greece, Poland, and Portugal, more than 2,000 extremist items were identified, hosted on 52 social media platforms. Jihadists have often relied on mainstream social media platforms for online communications and to spread propaganda, with private channels on messaging app Telegram being especially popular over the past year. Technology firms, such as Facebook and Google, have come under increasing political pressure to do more to tackle extremist material online and to make it harder for groups such as Islamic State to communicate through encrypted services to avoid detection by security services. However, Wainwright said that IS, by creating its own service, was responding to concerted pressure from intelligence agencies, police forces and the tech sector, and were trying to found a way around it. “We have certainly made it a lot harder for them to operate in this space but we’re still seeing the publication of these awful videos, communications operating large scale across the Internet,” he said, adding he did not know if it would be technically harder to take down IS’s own platform. Wainwright also said he believed that security cooperation between Britain and the EU would continue after Brexit, despite British warnings it is likely to leave Europol and cease sharing intelligence if it strikes no divorce deal with the bloc. “The operational requirement is for that to be retained. If anything, “If anything we need to have an even more closely  integrated pan-European response to security if you consider the way in which the threat is heading,” he said. Europe, he added, is facing “the highest terrorist threat for a generation”. However, Wainwright said there were important legal issues that would have to be thrashed out and it was not easy “to just cut and paste current arrangements”. “The legal issues have to be worked through and then they have to be worked through within of course the broader political context of the Article 50 negotiations (on Britain’s planned exit from the EU),” he said. “In the end I hope the grown-ups in the room will realize that ... security is one of the most important areas of the whole process. We need to get that right in the collective security interest of Europe as a whole, including of course the United Kingdom.” ","

Ergo’s parent Munich Re, the reinsurance company whose profit is set to drop in 2017 for a fifth consecutive year, has been highlighting its digital efforts and tweeted the blog on Friday. Investors voiced concern this week at Munich Re’s annual meeting that multiple digital initiatives have been slow to translate into profit and growth. In his blog, Klein described a meeting with China Unicom: “A formal setting, translators, a huge table.” “China Unicom wants to develop its business with data and we want to be one of its first customers,” he wrote. “We entered a strategic partnership. The goal: to combine data analytics applications with the expertise of the insurance company.” Klein also said he met with Talking Data, which he described as the Google Analytics of China. It captures the data from more than half a billion devices and knows user figures of all apps in China, he wrote. “Here, too, we are working on a cooperation,” he wrote. “The intention is that they help ERGO China Life to identify potential clients and improve sales agents management.” Ergo was unable to immediately provide figures for its China business. In 2016, Ergo generated nearly a quarter of revenue internationally, according to information on its website. Ergo posted a loss last year but expects to post a profit this year following restructuring and layoffs. Ergo hired Klein last year from T-Mobile Netherlands.

In its annual proxy statement, Alphabet revealed that Pichai was awarded with $198.7 million in stock last year, representing nearly double the $99.8 million he received in 2015. On top of that, Pichai earned a salary of $650,000, $2,500 less than he commanded the prior year, together with $372,000 for personal security services and air travel. (See also: A Look at Sundar Pichai: Google's New CEO.) Based on those figures, it would appear that Pichai, who became Google CEO in 2015 after his predecessor Larry Page took over the reins of the then newly created parent company Alphabet, was paid significantly more than his peers. Proxy statements filed before April 1 showed Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications (CHTR) earning more than any other CEO of a large publicly-traded company in 2016, according to Equilar. However, his overall compensation of $98 million still falls well short of Pichai’s total figure. Although he doesn’t show up in Equilar’s compensation package list, due to his status as CEO of a subsidiary, Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec told MarketWatch that Pichai is “probably” the highest paid top executive. Topping the firm’s list of the highest paid CEOs at U.S. public companies in 2015 was Dara Khosrowshahi at Expedia (EXPE), who earned total compensation of $94.6 million, less than half of what Pichai reportedly made last year. Meanwhile, Google co-founders Page and Sergey Brin didn’t even make the top 200 list last year. Alphabet Inc.’s CEO and president both continued to reward themselves with salaries of just one dollar for their roles in leading the company.

During Time Warner's earnings call, Richard Pepler, HBO's chief executive officer, said that the company does not plan to renew the licensing for its shows on Amazon's service beyond the end of 2018. This means that HBO shows that are on the air currently and have been renewed for a new season will not become available to Amazon subscribers. Per the agreement inked between the two companies, Amazon has the rights to stream a show only after it has run its course on HBO. (See also: Why HBO May Be About to Boost Time-Warner Stock.) Variety writes that Amazon's streaming service has become a competitor to HBO Now, Time Warner's streaming service that already has an extensive library of shows. The agreement between the two companies provided HBO with a means to gain audiences for its service. Pepler referenced the ""enormous momentum"" of sales driven through Amazon's service for HBO Now during his conversation. According to Variety, Time Warner's move indicates a change of priorities for HBO. ""The move reflects HBO's focus on growing the subscriber base of its HBO Now standalone digital service,"" the publication writes. (See also: How Are HBO, Amazon and Google Working to Overtake Netflix?) HBO is known for premium content that is generally popular with critics and audiences alike. For example, three of its shows – ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Silicon Valley"" and ""Girls"" – are wildly popular with TV viewers. HBO had revenue of $1.5 billion in the latest quarter – approximately 20 percent of Time Warner's overall revenue – and profit of $583 million. Time Warner launched HBO Now in 2015 to connect with millennials and audiences who do not have cable subscriptions that consume content across multiple devices. As of February this year, the service had approximately 2 million domestic subscribers. At a subscription rate of $15 per month, that translates to roughly $360 million in annual revenue. It could also be a substantial source of profit for the company in the future. This is because subscribers to the service pay Time Warner directly instead of paying their cable company. (See also: Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Instant Video Comparison.) For its part, Amazon is said to have ramped up its spending on producing original content for Amazon Video. The service, which is already present in 200 countries, is reported to be spending $4.5 billion on original content this year. HBO has a content budget of $2 billion for this year.

(See also: 25 Highest Paying Companies (And Jobs) In America.) According to a recent Equilar study, the highest paying CEO among the top 100 firms in the country made close to $98 million in 2016. That surprisingly is nearly three times the combined salary ($33.88 million) that the CEOs of the top five tech companies by market cap took home. Here’s a peak into what the top tech bosses earned last year: Despite a $1 million increment in his base salary to $3 million, Apple CEO Tim Cook’s total compensation for the year dropped nearly 17.5 percent to $8.75 million. While he did not receive any stock awards this year, the decline came along in the non-equity rewards component where he received $5.37 million; lower than $8 million in 2015. This component of the compensation is based on the company’s performance. Larry Page, co-founder and CEO of Google’s parent company, drew a token $1 salary last year. Moreover, SEC filings show that Page did not participate in the company’s stock reward program. Page owns close to 6 percent stake in Alphabet through the company’s Class A, B and C shares, while he has nearly 26 percent of the voting power. According to Forbes, as on May 1, 2017, Page’s net worth was close to $44.1 billion. If we consider only Google, CEO Sundar Pichai is the one raking in the big bucks. Company filings show that Pichai’s compensation for last year, almost doubled to $199.7 million. The primary component of that was a $198.6 million stock award followed by $650,000 in base salary and $372,000 in security and personal use of aircraft paid for by Google. Satya Nadella too saw his total compensation decline last year. According to SEC filings, Nadella took home $17.69 million last year, down from $18.29 million a year ago. While his base salary remained the same at $1.2 million, lower stock awards totaling to $12 million versus $12.7 million was the reason for this decline. Nadella also received a $4.46 million cash bonus and $14,000 in other benefits. Jeff Bezos is another tech CEO who does not draw a huge lump sum salary. He also isn’t the highest earning employee at the company. Last year, Bezos’ total compensation stood at $1.68 million, exactly the same compared to the prior year. This figure includes $81,840 in base salary and $1.6 million in security and travel costs that Amazon bore for Bezos. Bezos is one of the richest men in the world, with a net worth of close $80 billion. A few weeks ago, he surpassed the wealth of Warren Buffett to become the world’s second richest man, a position he has since lost to Zara owner Amancio Ortega. He owns close to 17 percent of Amazon and has pledged to divest nearly $1 billion worth of the company’s shares every year to fuel his space travel ambitions through Blue Origin.

Mrinalini Krishna,05042017,Investopedia,04272017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Unfair treatment meted out to certain kinds of workers is driving away people from tech jobs. According to the ‘Tech Leavers Study’ by the Kapor Center for Social Impact, not only is unfairness the biggest reason for tech workers to quit jobs, it can also cost tech companies close to $16 billion per year to find replacements. The study spans more than 2,000 people who left their tech jobs over the past three years. ""While the hot job market is typically blamed for high rates of turnover in tech, the data suggests it is a bit more complicated: experiences with unfairness are actually driving many employees to leave, particularly within tech companies,"" the study said. Employment data analyzed by the study suggests that women make up of only 25 percent of the tech workforce, while African Americans and Latinos are a mere 15 percent. As far as the largest tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook are concerned, African American and Latino employees form only 3 to 5 percent of all employees. Employee diversity and workplace environments at technology companies have been in focus recently since the allegations of sexual discrimination came to light against Uber. (See also: Sexism Charges Bring Uber's Toxic Culture to Fore.) Unfairness or mistreatment in the workplace drove 37 percent of people surveyed to quit, leading factors such as seeking better opportunities (35 percent), dissatisfaction with working environment (25 percent) or recruited by another company (22 percent). Nearly 78 percent of employees who responded to the survey said they faced some sort of unfairness at work. This includes being passed over for a promotion, given work below their job profile, other employees taking credit unfairly, or bullying and sexual harassment, among other things. The study points out that employees in technology companies (42 percent) were more likely to quit their jobs on grounds of unfairness compared to people working in technology roles in other industries (32 percent). Women, employees of color and LGBTQ employees reported higher instances of such behavior at their workplace. According to the study, one in ten women said they faced unwanted sexual attention while a significant number of LGBTQ employees were likely to be bullied (20 percent) or face public humiliation (24 percent). Not only are men and women of color underrepresented in these jobs, a quarter of those who work in the sector experienced stereotyping. “Almost one-third of underrepresented women of color were passed over for promotion—more than any other group,” the study said. Replacing employees who quit due to unfair treatment racks up huge costs for companies. The study pegs the total cost in 2016 at $16.1 billion, and calls that figure conservative. Based on average figures for employee turnover, every person who leaves costs the company $144,000 in full replacement costs, including lost productivity, recruiting costs and salary. A near realistic example of a large tech firm, the study envisions much larger costs. For example, a company with 10,000 engineers, paying each one $100,000 with an average turnover rate of 5 per cent and with 37 per cent of its employees quitting due to unfair behavior could see costs of up to $27 billion. Moreover, the study points out there could be additional indirect costs. Nearly 35 per cent of employees felt they would less likely recommend people to jobs in the company based on their own experiences while 25 per cent felt they would less likely recommend the company’s products or services to consumers. The fixes are not that difficult. Changing the work environment to one that fosters healthy employee relationships could be achieved through better policies. And the survey suggests that such moves could go a long way into not just making employees happy but also keeping them in the company. Almost 62 percent employees surveyed felt that they would have stayed in their jobs if the company had created a more positive and respectful work environment.

Rakesh Sharma,05042017,Investopedia,04272017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Given breathless coverage of flying cars this past week, it would seem that we are ready to take off into the future. Even as the vehicles have become a technological reality, it might be a while before they become a common occurrence. This is because the economics of owning or operating flying cars is expected to remain unsustainable for mass operations in the near term. (See also: How Flying Cars Could Land in Your Portfolio.)
  
Flying cars first caught hold of the public imagination after Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) chairman Larry Page was reported to be working on one. This past week, his company Kitty Hawk unveiled Flyer, its first flying car, which resembles a jet-ski. Other companies and startups have also joined the race. These include the likes of Airbus Group SE (EADSY) and German carmaker Volkswagen AG (VLKAY), which are collaborating to build a flying car, and startups such as German company Lilium, which completed a successful test run of its flying car over Bavaria last week. Ride-sharing startup Uber Technologies Inc. has also thrown its hat into the ring. At its Elevate summit, Uber said that it would roll out a fleet of flying cars for its ride-sharing service in Dallas Fort-Worth and Dubai by 2020. (See also: Is Google Investing in Flying Cars? Yes, It Is.) Typically, the influx of players into an industry has the potential to drive down costs and ensure that products become affordable for the masses. For example, personal computers became affordable after startups such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and corporations such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) flooded the incipient market with their devices. In the case of flying cars, however, the economic rationale for a similar sequence of events is fuzzy. None of the major players have revealed proposed pricing for their product. Kitty Hawk, Page's venture, is charging $100 for priority placement on the Flyer waitlist and a $2,000 discount when the vehicle is released. Terrafugia, a Boston-based startup, is taking refundable $10,000 deposits for Transition, its mass-market flying car. The company had initially projected a price of $194,000 for its flying car. However, that figure was revised to $279,000 and subsequently to between $300,000 and $400,000. Aeromobile, a startup based in Slovakia, has a sticker price of between $1.3 million and $1.6 million. In effect, this means that the initial batch of flying cars will cost the equivalent of a helicopter or more. (See also: A Look at Toyota's Flying Car Patent: Will It Become a Reality?) In part, this is due to the costs associated with technology for developing flying cars. Flying cars use more powerful and costly engines compared with automobiles. This is because they require significantly more thrust power for takeoff and landing. For example, Lilium's flying car uses 36 separate jet engines. Similarly, Israeli startup Cormorant's flying car uses a helicopter engine for its operations. The initial batch of flying cars will also have an additional infrastructure-related expense. Aeromobile's flying cars require a runway for operations. Flying cars that are able to take off and land without a runway will be unable to operate in dense urban environments without appropriate landing pads. (Kitty Hawk's Flyer video featured the vehicle taking off and landing on water.) This will tack on additional costs to their operations. One can make a case that mass production will lead to improvements in flying cars. But there are still technology-related challenges to overcome. For example, according to this post, the energy density of lithium-ion batteries needs to double so that they can be used as a source of power in flying cars. Based on predictions by Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, it will be approximately a decade before that happens. Meanwhile, prices for lithium-ion batteries are expected to decline, albeit slowly. (See also: Battery Storage to Boost Tesla Stock: Analyst.) In a study released last year, ride-sharing startup Uber laid out a possible roadmap to increased adoption of flying cars. According to the startup, such cars will be used on routes under-served by existing transportation infrastructure. ""A small number of vertiports (places earmarked for takeoff and landing of flying cars) could absorb a large share of demand from long-distance commuters since the 'last mile' ground transportation component is much smaller,"" the study's authors wrote. Uber has forecast an initial price of $200,000 for the cars. As the popularity of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles increases, more of these vehicles will be pressed into action, making the economics of producing VTOLs more akin to automobiles than aircraft. ""Once the ride-sharing service commences, a positive feedback loop should ensue that ultimately reduces costs and, thus, prices for all users,"" the study's authors write.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the telecom giant has just splashed out $10 million on Renovo Auto, the autonomous vehicle startup that shot to fame after converting a vintage DeLorean into a self-driving car. Based in California and founded in 2010, Renovo builds technology that brings together self-driving software, data analytics and safety systems. The company’s hundreds of sensors can reportedly generate multiple terabytes of data every hour, even in the most difficult of environments.

In the interview, which sent the company’s embattled shares up 4 per cent, Cuban claimed that firms specializing in AI are likely to experience better productivity and higher revenues off a smaller workforce, which should subsequently boost earnings. Cuban’s encouraging comments came after the social media giant credited better than expected quarterly earnings to machine learning techniques.

In March, Twitter joined forces with IBM (IBM) to improve its efforts to police controversial hate speech. IBM’s Watson AI technology, which is capable of monitoring various forms of text, is expected to make it easier for Twitter to stop nasty tweets and block repeated offenders. Twitter started making inroads in AI after acquiring image-reading technology specialist Magic Pony Technology last summer. (See also: Twitter Acquires Magic Pony.) Twitter still lags other firms that have poured capital into AI, like Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB).

It was a classic phishing scam wherein an attacker tries to gain your information by tricking you into opening something. If you opened the document, you were asked to give permission for it to access your account. Then it sent itself out to everyone in your address book. Oops. Did you do that? If so, don't worry too much. Google says it has already disabled the offending accounts (only 0.1 percent were affected), and that it was able to stop the worm within an hour.

Since it's not quite clear what sort of information that phishing attack could have grabbed, it's still a good idea to make some changes. We should take this event as a reminder that we're all potentially vulnerable to attack, even when the attack is disguised as an email from a friend or family member. Here's what to do to keep yourself safe and how to access Google's Security Checkup. This is easy, and you should get in the habit of doing it often. Visit your Google Account page and select the ""Signing in to Google"" option. Next, tap ""password"" and change it. If you haven't done so before, take this chance to use something unique with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and unique symbols. From the Google Account page, tap ""Signing in to Google"" once more and then tap 2-Step verification and enable it. This will send you a special code each time you log in. It wouldn't have helped prevent the phishing attack, but it'll make it harder for someone to sign in to your account should your password ever be compromised. It's always wise to use this option. Finally, perform the Google Security Checkup that Google recommends. This checks your settings and activity to make sure that you've approved all of the apps and other content that can access your Google account. If something changed yesterday, you can revoke access during this process. From the Google My Account page, simply select the ""Security Checkup"" option. Follow along with Google as it double-checks everything that has access to your account. It only takes a few minutes, and it's wise to do this a couple of times a year just to be safe.

China has three businesses in the ranking: search engine Baidu (4), TV station CCTV (20) and Tencent (14), owner of messaging app WeChat.

Chantel McGee,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"If there was any doubt that Silicon Valley hates limitations on hiring skilled immigrants to work in the U.S., Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt made it clear. ""The stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas,"" Schmidt said while speaking at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab on Wednesday. Alphabet is the parent company of Google. ""We want the best people in the world, regardless of any form of sex, race, country, what-have-you. We want them to work for us and not our competitors,"" he said. Policy restrictions like that make it more difficult for U.S. companies to remain competitive, he said. ""We should organize our country to be the most attractive place for those people. Stupid government policies that restrict us from [having] a fair chance of getting those people are antithetical to our mission [and] the things we serve,"" said Schmidt. Schmidt also said that despite the rapid pace of technological advancement he isn't worried about artificial intelligence taking jobs. ""I've taken the position of 'job elimination denier.' I've just decided I'm going to be contrarian, because the data supports me, and it's more fun to be in opposition anyway,"" he said. Still, ""there's no question that there's job dislocation. But there [are] always new solutions,"" he said. ""The economic folks would say that you can see the job that's lost, but you very seldom can see the job that's created.""

Fred Imbert,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Wall Street has high expectations for Amazon and Google's parent company, Alphabet, after they reported great earnings. Analysts now expect the tech investors' cult favorites to hit $1,000 a share over the next 12 months, according to the average price forecast collected by FactSet. The average price 12-month price target for Amazon is $1,049.23 a share and Alphabet's totals $1,031.36. Alphabet and Amazon both hovered around $930 during Friday trading. A month ago the Wall Street targets for both were below $1,000. Alphabet smashed first-quarter earnings and sales estimates as mobile search and YouTube drove ad sales higher. Meanwhile, Amazon saw its quarterly revenue jump 23 percent year over year as sales for Amazon Web Services totaled $3.66 billion. While it's not clear who will break the millennium mark first, Raymond James' Aaron Kessler — an analyst who covers both — said he's leaning toward Alphabet. ""We're more positive on Google for now as they have a better valuation,"" Kessler said. ""Until we see more meaningful margin expansion, I think [Amazon] shares are going to be range-bound in the near term."" That said, investors may have to be patient to see either stock reach the $1,000 per-share mark. ""Both of these stocks were making new highs leading into earnings, so I'd expect short-term traders to sell some of these shares after the spike,"" said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics.

Matt Hunter,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"People like famed physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla's Elon Musk have issued dark warnings of a world where computers become so sophisticated, so quickly, that humanity loses control of them—and its own destiny as a result. Yet Peter Norvig, a leading artificial intelligence scientist and a director of research at Google, thinks that's far-fetched. ""I don't buy into the killer robot [theory],"" he told CNBC this week. The real worry is how to prepare for the mass elimination of jobs that is surely coming, he said. ""I certainly see that there will be disruptions in employment … we've already seen a lot of change, that's going to continue,"" Norvig said in an interview, before a lecture on machine learning at the Stevens Institute of Technology. By now there's wide consensus on this matter, the question is really just scale — whether the impact of machine learning is minimal or whether it consumes half of all jobs over the next decade. Although this process is well underway with manufacturing jobs, more and more it's going to creep up the value chain, altering or eliminating any number of jobs in law, finance and even media. ""The pace may be so fast that it [will] cause disruptions,"" Norvig said. ""So we need to find ways to mitigate that."" Norvig, a former computer scientist as NASA, sympathized with anyone frightened by the prospect.  ""It is scary,"" he said. But just as the internal combustion engine ultimately led to the demise of the stagecoach, and also to millions of new jobs, so will these destructive technologies lead to new opportunities that are now unimagined. ""It's easy to see jobs disappearing ... [but] it's hard to see the new jobs that will be invented because they don't exist yet. ""There will always be stuff to do,"" he said. Young people starting on their career path shouldn't necessarily be discouraged by machine learning, or abandon career aspirations because of it, Norvig said. Instead, ""find something [you're] interested in that provides something that people want, and think deeply about it."" ""Be aware of the various technologies and be able to use them, and apply them to whatever field you're interested in,"" he added. Norvig also believes the rest of society has an obligation to support—either through universal basic income, a WPA-like program, or some other means—people whose livelihoods are eliminated so quickly that they are unable to adapt. ""There has to be some social program for people who say 'I had a job, and now I don't—I've got no family to fall back on, what do I do?'"" he said.

Marguerite Ward,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Few will ever step foot inside the office of Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company and co-founder of Google. But Kim Scott, a former Google executive turned top CEO coach, met with the tech leader numerous times. One such meeting with Page almost went awry, and taught Scott a key leadership lesson. While leading Google's AdSense team several years ago, Scott was in a meeting with Page and former Google exec Matt Cutts, who now works on tech solutions for the U.S. government. According to Scott's account in her book ""Radical Candor,"" Page was proposing a new plan, and Cutts apparently didn't agree with it. As Scott writes, Cutts allegedly started ""yelling"" at Page, the billionaire co-founder of the company. ""I truly thought, 'Wow, here is a colleague I really respect and like raising his voice at Larry Page,'"" Scott tells CNBC. ""I thought he was going to get fired."" But Page's reaction surprised her. Instead of raising his voice or getting angry, the tech leader simply grinned. ""Not only did he permit Matt's challenging him,"" Scott says, ""he seemed to relish it."" The Google co-founder appreciated the feedback and challenge, Scott says. The three ended up having a productive and collaborative conversation, and Cutts, who was not fired, stayed at Google for years. Amazed, Scott decided to adopt Page's strategy, encouraging employees to speak up in meetings and offer her constructive feedback. Scott, who as a CEO coach has advised C-suite clients at Dropbox, Twitter and other top companies, says other leaders should encourage more open and honest conversations. When done in a professional manner, team members can share their knowledge and expertise in a way that makes their teammates more productive and leaders more informed. Scott isn't the only one has spoken about the benefits of honest and direct conversations. According to self-made millionaire and serial entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis, being able to form an argument for an idea and having the courage to state it — even to the point of challenging your boss — can make you stand out, in a good way. For Ursula Burns, chairwoman and former CEO of Xerox, having the courage to challenge a VP in a meeting, which she thought would get her fired, actually fast-tracked her career.

Marguerite Ward,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"If you want to feel happier and less stressed, you have to get specific about what it will take to get there. That's the advice of former Google career coach and job strategist Jenny Blake, who has helped more than a thousand people improve their work lives. To get serious about living a better life, Blake recommends creating a happiness equation, or a list of ingredients that, when added together, help you prevent burnout and feel inspired. Here's how to create your personal happiness equation: 1. List your ingredients ""Brainstorm a list of all the activities, all the ingredients that bring you joy,"" Blake tells CNBC. Be specific and think about what you need on a daily basis. For example your list of activities may include, seeing friends, working out, eating well or working on a side project. ""What are the activities,"" she says, ""where if you were to get these done in a given day or week, takes you 80 percent of the way toward feeling great?"" Blake emphasizes being happy 80 percent of the time, because while you don't want to be unrealistic and assume doing these activities will make you feel happy all of the time, you do want to aim high. 2. Design your routine ""Once you identify your must haves and you core ingredients,"" Blake says, ""think about how you can systematize them and include them in your day-to-day and weekly routines."" For example, your equation might look like: Happiness = Seeing a friend once a week + working out two times a week + going to bed by 10 p.m. + devoting 15 minutes each day to my side project. Creating a routine is crucial because it makes your big goals manageable. According to behavioral psychologist and researcher Dan Ariely, the biggest reason why people don't achieve their goals is because they don't break them down into actionable steps. ""Block off non-negotiable time on your calendar,"" Blake says, ""to make sure that all these things can get done."" And of course, if after a few weeks or months your happiness equation needs updating, adjust it. ""It's a great shortcut you can return to at any time,"" Blake says, ""Ask yourself, 'What can I activate to turn [my life] around?'""

Todd Haselton,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Microsoft announced the Surface Laptop on Tuesday at an event highlighting the company's latest products for the education market. Although the Surface Laptop runs a watered-down version of Windows 10 and is targeted at the education segment, don't expect it to stay that way: it's both way too powerful and way too expensive to be truly focused on the education market. Rather, Microsoft is continuing to up the battle against Apple's Mac computers — and its own partners. But this time, it came at the fight from the side. Microsoft's messaging during the event was confusing at best. The company first seemed to be chasing after Google Chromebooks, the most popular computer currently in classrooms, by introducing a new version of its operating system called Windows 10 S. The new operating system is easy to manage and allows users to install applications only from the Windows Store — the millions of legacy Windows apps that make Windows such a useful ecosystem are mostly not permitted. Users are also limited to using Microsoft's Edge browser by default. Then it rolled the Surface Laptop -- a $999 computer that comes with similar hardware specifications as the latest MacBook, but with newer processors. Most Chromebooks are in a completely different class. $200 to $400 gets you a decent machine for interacting with Google's suite of products, like Gmail, Docs and, most recently, even Android apps, but you can't do much else. There's not usually much on board storage — the idea, in Google's world, is that you'll do most of your work in Google's cloud instead. So what was Microsoft doing showing a powerful computer hobbled with an operating system that doesn't let you do very much? Here's the trick: Consumers who buy the Surface Laptop can pay a one-time $49 upgrade fee to move from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro. (That fee is going to be temporarily waived on devices priced $799 or higher, Microsoft told CNBC.) That upgrade allows users to use any browser they want and cuts down the walled-garden approach to apps, too, which means you can install anything outside of the Windows app store. In other words, Microsoft almost seemed to be disguising this device, slipping it under the radar as an educational product, when it's really going to go right after Apple's Macbook. The Surface Laptop is half the price of Microsoft's larger Surface Book laptop, which was first released in 2015. That machine is more targeted at stealing MacBook Pro users, which puts the Surface Laptop square against Apple's entry-level machines. It has all the hardware to compete, much more than what's required in a classroom. It runs on Intel's powerful Core i5 or Core i7 processors. That's enough muscle to run Adobe Photoshop and demanding applications, unlike Chromebooks. I think Microsoft's real target market here is students heading off to college. By positioning the Surface Laptop toward ""education"" it can attract a crowd that might otherwise be looking at MacBooks. Which brings me to my final point. Save for Windows 10 S, which can be upgraded easily, the Surface Laptop looks like a perfect machine for business. Again, it has the hardware, it's attractive in its design, it's thin and light, and it offers ports that are still important, like USB and SD, which Apple has abandoned in its designs. The Surface Laptop is too powerful and too attractive to remain an education play. It won't be long before this is targeted at consumers and businesses, too.

It's well known that digital advertising is a megatrend fueling the growth of companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. IAB estimates U.S. ad spend grew nearly 22% last year. eMarketer expects the market to grow another 16% this year, reaching $83 billion. But investors expecting to reap rewards from the trend by investing in a smaller digital advertising platform besides Facebook or Google may be missing out. An analysis of IAB's annual report by Pivotal Research shows the two advertising giants accounted for 99% of the growth in U.S. digital ad spending. Everybody else combined to just stand still. Image source: Google. There's really only one reason why Facebook and Google keep growing faster than the rest of the market: People keep spending more time using their sites and apps. Facebook is a dominant force in display advertising, which accounted for 44% of U.S. digital ad spend last year, a total of $31.7 billion. That's up 29% year over year, as it accounted for a larger piece of the market than 2015. For reference, Facebook's ad revenue grew 61.7% year over year in 2016. That's more than twice as fast as the overall display ad market. Facebook users spend an average of 50 minutes per day between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. And there's 1.9 billion of them. Importantly, those numbers are still growing. Facebook's last update of 50 minutes per day was about a year ago, but it was up from 40 minutes just nine months prior. Facebook's 1.9 billion monthly active users is up 16.9% from the end of last year. As a result, Google is benefiting from a significant increase in searches per user. And as the only game in town -- at least the only one that matters -- Google is seeing a steady increase in search ad revenue. Google is also benefiting from the ever-growing popularity of YouTube, and its display ad network revenue continues to grow modestly. Image source: Facebook Both Facebook and Google are even more dominant on mobile devices. As mentioned, Google is benefiting from a growth in mobile searches. In fact, mobile searches may be eating into desktop searches. IAB estimates desktop search advertising fell 13% last year, but mobile search advertising increased 91%. Google takes about 95% of all searches on mobile, but just about 63% on desktops. As more searches shift to mobile, Google stands to gain even more share of the market. Facebook, likewise, is the most dominant app on mobile devices. Users are spending more and more time in apps these days, reaching five hours per day in the fourth quarter last year, according to Flurry Analytics. Total time spent in apps was up 69% year over year. The biggest contributing factor was messaging and social apps, which grew nearly fivefold  in 2016. Flurry says Facebook managed to take 19% of those five hours, nearly one hour on its own. Add to that the time spent in Instagram, and it's absolutely dominating the time users spend on mobile. These trends aren't slowing down. Mobile ads accounted for 51% of ad spend last year compared to just 35% in 2015. As more ad spending shifts to mobile, the strength of Facebook and Google will only continue to benefit, while everyone else collectively struggles to tread water. ","

Shares of Endeavour Silver (NYSE:EXK), a silver- and gold-mining company with assets in both North and South America, surged as much as 13% on Wednesday after the company released its first-quarter earnings results before the opening bell. For the quarter, Endeavour Silver produced 1.9 million silver-equivalent ounces (SEO), with total silver production declining 29% year over year and gold production falling 27% from the prior-year quarter. Based on what was sold, Endeavour wound up generating $36.4 million in quarterly revenue, a 12% decline from Q1 2016. Endeavour's weaker production is likely a carryover from its reduced capital expenditures, which were a result of falling precious-metal prices. However, lower production was mitigated by a 17% increase in silver's average per-ounce price. Image source: Getty Images. In terms of its bottom line, Endeavour reported $6 million in net earnings, or $0.05 per share, which was a 230% improvement over the $1.8 million, or $0.02 per share, it reported in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased a considerably more modest 4%, to $9 million. Comparatively, Wall Street had been looking for a profit of just $0.01 per share, so this $0.04-per-share beat has brought out Endeavour's luster on Wednesday. Though Endeavour Silver's bottom line showed a clear year-over-year improvement, Wall Street and investors are probably going to need to see some sizable improvement in production before pushing shares of this stock considerably higher. The good news on that front is that Endeavour is beginning to get more aggressive with its exploration spending. As noted in its Q1 press release, Endeavour recently decided to move forward with development of the El Compas mine, and it could soon give the thumbs-up to the development of Terronera as its fifth mine. The big question is going to be whether Endeavour can keep its costs under control as it undertakes this major expansion. Cost-cutting has helped it deliver decent results, but cost-cutting isn't an effective long-term strategy for a mining company. Endeavour has an opportunity to be a diamond in the rough for patient long-term investors, but we're probably a good two or three years away from seeing its expansionary efforts translate into significant bottom-line expansion.

Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) recently reported its first-quarter financial results, and while the company remains the market share leader in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, there are signs that its dominance could be waning. MS is a central nervous system disorder that can cause muscle weakness, blurred vision, and numbness. Patients are typically diagnosed with MS while they're in their 20s or 30s, and there currently isn't a cure. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Roughly 10,000 new cases of MS are diagnosed in the U.S. every year, and the total patient population worldwide is about 2.5 million. Because MS is a chronic condition, patients receive treatment for it throughout their lifetime, and that translates into a lot of prescriptions written annually for MS drugs. Currently, the MS market is worth about $20 billion per year, and Biogen is the largest player, with about a 38% market share. Altogether, Biogen markets $3 billion blockbuster MS drugs, including the company's best seller, Tecfidera, an oral MS drug that posted first-quarter sales of $958 million. Its other drugs include Avonex and Tysabri, which generated sales last quarter of $537 million and $545 million, respectively, and it also markets Plegridy, a long-lasting formulation of Avonex that brought in first-quarter sales of $112 million. The bright spot in Biogen's first-quarter results is that sales of Tysabri increased 14% year over year. Biogen's other drugs, however, didn't perform nearly as well. Tecfidera's sales were up only 1% and Avonex's sales fell 5%. Lackluster top-line growth for Tecfidera is particularly concerning. In the past, Biogen's sales have benefited from both increasing volume and higher prices. Recently, pushback on pricing has crimped Biogen's pricing power, making it more reliant on new prescriptions. Those new prescriptions, though, are getting harder to come by. Oral MS drugs are unquestionably the best in terms of treatment choices, but Tecfidera's not the only oral option. Novartis sells Gilenya and Sanofi sells Aubagio, and based on sales growth last quarter, Tecfidera appears to be losing ground to them. For perspective, Gilenya sales increased 3.4% to $722 million and Aubagio's revenue grew 29.7% to $371 million in Q1. In discussing its first-quarter performance, Biogen estimated that lower inventory levels in the U.S. weighed down Tecfidera's sales. It also indicated that demand could be feeling some negative impact from the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of Roche's Ocrevus, the only approved medicine for treating both relapsing and primary progressive MS. Biogen's management admitted that there could have been some warehousing of patients ahead of Ocrevus' approval in late March. If so, then Ocrevus' toll on Biogen's market share could get bigger as its launch gains momentum. Some headwinds for Biogen's MS market share due to Ocrevus will be offset by the fact that Roche owes Biogen royalties on Ocrevus sales. However, those royalties cap out at 30%, so they won't make up all the potential damage. Importantly, Ocrevus isn't the only new drug that could dent Biogen's MS dominance. Recently, Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) reported compelling phase 3 data for its oral MS drug, ozanimod, and results from a second confirmatory phase 3 trial are expected soon. If results are good, then Celgene could file for ozanimod's approval later this year, clearing the way for an FDA OK by the end of 2018. Because ozanimod is an oral drug that works similarly to Gilenya (but is more selective), ozanimod could have billion-dollar blockbuster potential. It's not all bleak for Biogen. The company recently launched Spinraza, the first FDA-approved therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, and $47 million in Q1 sales suggests it's off to a fast start. The company's also got some intriguing drugs in the pipeline, including treatments for Alzheimer's disease. However, Spinraza's growth may end up simply offsetting sliding MS revenue, and Alzheimer's disease drugs have a high clinical trial failure rate, so it's too early to bank on them. Overall, growing competition makes me think this could be a tough couple of years to be a Biogen investor. ","

Shares of Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) have dropped today, down 15.9% as of 11:45 a.m. EDT, after the company reported first-quarter earnings. Expected to report $0.73 per share in profit on $3.6 billion in Q1 sales, Synchrony instead reported only $0.61 per share earned -- despite raking in more than $3.99 billion in revenue. This was a big miss for Synchrony, and it kind of shocked Wall Street -- the more so because Synchrony's profits actually declined year over year, whereas Wall Street had expected the banker to eke out a small gain. One year ago, Synchrony had earned $0.70 per share in Q1 2016 profits. Explaining its loss, Synchrony noted that while its interest income increased a respectable 12% in Q1, the bank was forced to take a $403 million provision against anticipated higher loan losses. This wiped out the gains in interest, and reduced profit for the bank as a whole. Image source: Getty Images. Priced today at barely 10 times earnings, Synchrony shares look fairly valued relative to analysts' consensus prediction of an eventual return to 9%-plus annual earnings growth, especially factoring in the bank's just-confirmed 1.6% dividend yield.

    Why Synchrony Financial Stock Plummeted Today -- The Motley Fool

Shares of Sunoco LP (NYSE:SUN) rose nearly 26% last month after the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell nearly 1,110 convenience stores to 7-Eleven. It did not include the valuable Aloha Petroleum unit in Hawaii or any APlus franchisee-operated stores, although an additional 200 convenience stores -- the remaining brand-owned stores -- are now available for sale. The transaction will inject $3.3 billion into the coffers of one of America's most identifiable brands -- immediately improving the debt-ridden balance sheet -- and allow it to focus nearly exclusively on being one of the nation's top fuel suppliers. The deal includes a 15-year take-or-pay contract to supply 7-Eleven with approximately 2.2 billion gallons of transportation fuels per year. In other words, long-term investors now have a more predictable income stream to rely on for future periods. Image source: Getty Images. The move comes after management had struggled to improve the financial profile of Sunoco LP through organic growth and smaller asset sales and received little help from its parent, Energy Transfer Partners. Consider that debt increased 82% from September 2015 to September 2016 on the heels of major acquisitions. While those transactions added slow and steady growth potential for the long haul, they also ballooned the leverage ratio to an astounding 6.75. At the end of last year, long-term debt totaled $4.5 billion. The company's previous strategic plan called for a gradual step down to ""healthier"" levels of 5.50 by March 2019, although that was still a relatively high level of debt to carry around -- and getting there wouldn't have been easy. The sale agreement with 7-Eleven puts Sunoco LP firmly on a very different path. SUN data by YCharts Sure, the retail business was achieving consistent growth -- including 27 consecutive years of same-store merchandise sales growth -- but it wasn't the silver bullet needed to rapidly deleverage the company. That realization can frame the transaction for investors that management traded high-margin retail business with painfully slow debt reduction for a significantly lower debt balance overnight and predictable cash flows from long-term fuel supply contracts. It's a big win, even if it was unexpected. The 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven provides an additional benefit for investors: preserving the Sunoco brand. It's possible that the new owner wouldn't have changed a thing given the value in the historic name, but that small detail should nonetheless continue to bolster the company's footprint, especially considering it will retain possession of the Aloha Petroleum and APlus brands, and its valuable NASCAR sponsorship. Sunoco LP made a difficult but wise move by pivoting to focus on its fuel supply business. It will preserve the strong reputation of its brand, smooth out long-term cash flows, and immediately reduce debt levels. Long story short, Sunoco LP's future became much brighter much sooner last month -- and long-term investors were immediately rewarded by the stock's jump. ","

Shares of Geron (NASDAQ:GERN), a clinical-stage developer of cancer therapeutics, surged 13% in April, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. One major catalyst provided the foundation for Geron's excellent month: a long-awaited clinical data release. On April 10, Geron announced that its licensing partner, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), had completed its second internal data review of the IMerge and IMbark trials that respectively pertain to imetelstat as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes and myelofibrosis. As you can probably surmise from the move higher, things are moving along nicely after a bit of a hiccup following the first internal data review. Image source: Getty Images. In the initial review of the IMbark study for myelofibrosis, Johnson & Johnson ceased study of the lower-dose 4.7 mg/kg because it was ineffective, which clearly concerned investors about the remaining dose of 9.4 mg/kg. However, the second review found sufficient evidence that the 9.4 mg/kg dose should be the starting dose for further studies. Though the press release didn't offer too many specifics, it did note a lower spleen response rate in front-line myelofibrosis patients than with other drugs, but imetelstat appeared to offer more appealing outcome measures with regard to relapsed or refractory myelofibrosis patients. Within the next year, Geron and J&J should be able to offer overall survival data from the study. As for IMerge, part one of the phase 2/3 trial in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes demonstrated a similar safety profile to previous clinical trials. Additionally, the benefit and risk assessment of the eight-week and 24-week transfusion independence and hematologic improvement by erythroid response suggests continued development of the drug in lower-risk patients. Data is currently being culled from the study for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Should Johnson & Johnson move forward with the phase 3 portion of this two-part study, patient enrollment is expected to begin in the fourth quarter. Johnson & Johnson took a pretty big gamble by betting on imetelstat, but it could wind up paying off for J&J and Geron's shareholders. The deal, which was forged back in Nov. 2014 and netted J&J Geron $35 million upfront and the ability to earn up to $900 million in milestone payments, may give J&J its next blockbuster drug. Image source: Getty Images. For example, in early stage studies conducted prior to the tie-up with J&J, imetelstat demonstrated partial and complete responses in myelofibrosis patients, which was something never before seen in clinical studies. The only current FDA-approved drug for myelofibrosis treats symptoms associated with the disease, such as an enlarged spleen, and not the disease itself. With a drug targeting the actual disease, Geron's therapy could become a go-to drug for myelofibrosis patients, if approved. If there is a downside here, it's that Geron's entire portfolio is imetelstat or bust. It means that clinical data is few and far between, leaving emotions and short-term thinking to rule the roost most of the time. I continue to lean toward seeing Geron succeed with imetelstat, but with only one horse in the stable, a trial failure would essentially wipe out much of your investment. That's something to keep in mind as you monitor Geron's progress. ","

Leo Sun,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) has been a tough stock to own over the past year. Despite posting around 60% annual sales growth in its first two quarters as a public company, concerns about its valuation, lack of profits, and heavy dependence on a handful of customers kept investors at bay. As a result, Twilio took investors on a roller-coaster ride -- surging from an IPO price of $15 last June to almost $70 before plunging back to the low $30s. But Twilio still trades at 6.3 times sales today, which remains slightly higher than its industry average of 5.5. Image source: Getty Images. I recently discussed Twilio's near-term challenges, and noted that it was still a decent speculative stock to own. But today, I'll look much further ahead into Twilio's future to see where the company could be in ten years. Let's discuss five possible futures for the cloud service provider. Twilio's cloud service -- which serves as a middleman for delivering SMS messages, voice calls, videos, and other content within mobile apps -- is widely considered a ""best in breed"" service for app developers. That's why its top customers include Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger and WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb. These companies pay Twilio to handle those requests, since it's generally cheaper and more convenient than developing those features from scratch. This approach lets developers dedicate most of their resources to refining core services, like WhatsApp's messaging features or Uber's ride-hailing service. That best in breed reputation makes Twilio a lucrative buyout target for any cloud-based company that wants to add Facebook and Uber to its list of clients. A potential suitor might be Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, which already uses Twilio's platform to deliver text and voice messages to software developers. However, companies like Amazon and Facebook could also realize that they could simply add Twilio-like features to their own data centers, which could cut the company out of the loop. There's also the threat of carriers launching similar cloud services for delivering voice and text messages to apps. Internet telephony provider Vonage (NYSE:VG), for example, acquired Twilio's smaller rival Nexmo last year. That purchase didn't seem significant until Uber's rival Lyft started using Nexmo alongside Twilio as a potential ""alternative"" provider for SMS messages earlier this year. If push comes to shove, Vonage could apply a loss-leader strategy to Nexmo to lure other customers away from Twilio -- which could send Twilio's bottom line slipping further into the red. Twilio has been adding new services to its platform to boost its average revenues per customer. Last year, it launched the Twilio Enterprise Plan, which offers security, access management, and administration tools for large organizations. If Twilio develops or acquires more cybersecurity assets for that platform, it could evolve into a full-featured cybersecurity company that encrypts all the data delivered across its protected mobile apps. That move would certainly lock in more customers and widen its moat against rivals like Vonage. In many ways, Twilio resembles a young Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) -- a rapidly growing cloud SaaS (software as a service) provider with a head start in a niche market. That's probably why the company recently hired former Salesforce COO George Hu as its new COO. With Hu on board, Twilio might start diversifying its business with additional cloud-based services. For example, Salesforce expanded inorganically to diversify its core CRM (customer relationship management) business into four main segments -- its Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Salesforce Platform. By scaling up, Salesforce maintained its market-leading position and eventually generated consistent non-GAAP profits. If Twilio follows that model -- by leveraging its market-leading position in cloud-based SMS and video delivery to expand into other cloud markets -- it could become a more diversified and profitable business over the next decade. I won't pretend to know where Twilio is headed, but a lot could happen within the next decade. I personally own a small position in Twilio, but I believe that it remains a highly speculative play which could either double or be cut in half over the next few years. This makes it an interesting side bet on the cloud and mobile markets, but it's far too risky as a core position for most investors. ","

John Bromels,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""World's Largest"" is a big selling point for tourist attractions. If you don't believe me, consider that three towns in the U.S. hotly contest which has the world's largest ball of twine (Darwin, Minnesota; Branson, Missouri; and Cawker City, Kansas). Being the world's largest is a selling point for companies, too, because it often means the company has competitive advantages like economy of scale or market penetration over its smaller rivals. Here are three things you probably didn't know about the world's largest independent oil and gas production and exploration company, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). ConocoPhillips is getting out of costlier fields to focus on traditional onshore oil driilling. Image source: Getty Images. Yes, ConocoPhillips is the world's largest independent oil and gas production and exploration company (what a mouthful!). But that actually doesn't give it a particular advantage, because there are a lot of much larger, much better capitalized companies operating in this space. Those are what's known as the ""integrated majors,"" meaning companies that not only drill for oil but also have midstream (storing and transporting) and downstream (refining and selling) operations. ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell are the two largest integrated majors, by market cap and annual revenue, respectively, but even the smallest integrated major, Total SA, has more than five times the annual revenue of ConocoPhillips. Other players in the oil and gas space, although not direct competitors of Conoco, are also larger by annual revenue. These include some transportation and refining companies like Marathon Petroleum and oil services company Schlumberger. Still, Conoco is quite large, with a market cap of more than $60 billion and annual revenue of about $24.4 billion. But it may be about to get smaller. ConocoPhillips has been shedding many of its assets as it tries to lower its breakeven point so it can become profitable again. Slumping oil prices have caused Conoco -- and most if not all of its peers -- a lot of pain as it costs oil drillers more to produce a barrel of oil than they can sell it for. Conoco has decided to try to get its finances under control by focusing on projects with a low breakeven point while jettisoning the ones that cost more. It has already announced its intention to exit the expensive and risky business of deepwater drilling, and sold off three deepwater exploration blocks off the coast of Senegal in late 2016. The asset trimming continued in March and April 2017 as the company sold off some Canadian assets that mostly produced lower-margin bitumen and natural gas, and a field in the San Juan Basin of the southwestern U.S. that was also primarily a natural gas field. After these two transactions close later this year, the company's average cost of production will drop from approximately $40 per barrel to $35 per barrel. The transactions will also put $13.3 billion in cash into the company's coffers. That $13.3 billion in asset sales (on top of a few other sales already announced) means that the company has outpaced its own projections. In a major investor presentation in November 2016, Conoco outlined its ""three-year plan"" to sell $5 billion to $8 billion in assets by the end of 2018 and use the cash to reduce its overall debt to $20 billion by the end of 2019. This means they've sold more in one year than they'd planned to in three. CEO Ryan Lance was pleased with the effect the sales would have on the company, particularly the Canadian transaction, stating, ""This transaction will make an immediate and significant impact on the company's value proposition by allowing us to rapidly reduce debt to $20 billion and double our share repurchase authorization to $6 billion. ... This is truly a transformational event."" The company expects the debt reduction and share repurchases to lead to double-digit total returns for investors, and that's just assuming that oil prices remain above $50 per barrel. If they climbed to above $60, it would be icing on what's already looking like a pretty rich cake. There's one more thing you don't know about ConocoPhillips, and it's something I don't know, either: Can it pull this off? It's off to a good start by successfully selling the lower-margin assets it needed to sell (and more), and exiting costly deepwater projects. Shareholders will see immediate benefits as debt reduction reduces the company's annual interest expense and helps clean up the balance sheet. And indeed, the company's stock price popped more than 10% after the news broke. If oil prices cooperate, this could be the start of a ""world's largest"" turnaround for ConocoPhillips. It's definitely a stock to add to your watch list. ","

Last month, Google came under fire after ads were found being served on inappropriate YouTube content, with a long list of big advertisers and brands promising to pull ads from the video-streaming site. But advertisers’ comments came near the close of the first quarter, which ended on March 31, so it’s feasible that any impact may not be felt until the June quarter. Some Wall Street analysts have estimated the impact to Alphabet’s results would be lost ad revenue ranging from about $750 million to about $1 billion in calendar 2017. At least one analyst has also speculated that advertisers were using the controversy as a way to get better YouTube advertising rates. Google does not break out YouTube’s results separately, even though its revenue is now estimated to be approaching the same levels as Netflix Inc.

Google executives did not answer the question specifically but instead talked about progress it had made with advertisers with its new safeguard and other measures. “We have taken it pretty seriously and taken significant steps,” Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said. “As part of doing that, we brought new technical solutions into place.

He also highlighted working with Google on identifying “white sites” and “black sites.” Alphabet, though, is not yet giving any further granularity to investors on the issue, who also may have been frustrated by the lack of any numbers in the discussion of the company’s growth in cloud computing, even though it was described as one of the recipients of Google’s biggest investments. Whether advertisers look or a price break or take their business elsewhere, investors have another three months before they see if there has been any impact from the YouTube boycott, and whether or not any ad spending drop will spill over into Google’s core search-ad business.

Giovanni Legorano,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: May 4, 2017 2:30 p.m. ET By ROME -- Alphabet Inc.'s Google has agreed to pay around EUR306 million ($334 million) in back taxes in Italy, settling one of multiple legal and regulatory battles that have dogged the tech giant in Europe. The settlement ends one of several probes into Google's tax arrangements in the European Union, as governments maintain the pressure on other U.S. giants they accuse of tax evasion. The tax probes come as Brussels and national capitals crack down on what they view as corporate tax abuse, both by pushing to change international tax rules and by investigating companies that have struck deals with low-tax jurisdictions to slash their tax bill. Thursday's agreement between Google and Italy relates mainly to corporate taxes the Italians say Google failed to pay between 2009 and 2015. Rome alleges Google routed more than EUR1 billion in Italy-based revenue to its office in Ireland, where tax rates are far lower. A company spokesman said that of the EUR306 million in back taxes, EUR303 million was attributed to Google Italy, with the rest to Google Ireland. As part of the deal, Google will agree to pay taxes on future income -- largely related to advertising sales -- generated in Italy, according to Italian tax authorities. Google has long argued that clients in countries such as Italy don't actually close any advertising deals with employees in these countries, but instead buy the spots from Google Ireland, the company's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, a person familiar with the company's thinking said Google preferred to settle with Rome to bring to a close a controversy that has cast a negative light on the company in Italy. The Italian probe is just one of a number of judicial problems facing Google in Europe, where it has also faced scrutiny from national tax authorities in France and the U.K. The company also remains entangled in three separate antitrust investigations led by the European Commission, the bloc's top competition watchdog, which accuses Google of abusing its dominant position and favoring its own products over those of competitors. The company has denied the allegations. Governments have taken particular aim at complex corporate structures that allow companies to book revenue in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, that they have earned in high-tax countries such as Italy. Last August, the commission ordered Apple Inc. to return $13 billion to Ireland in unpaid taxes. Apple is appealing, as is Ireland, which accuses Brussels of meddling in its domestic tax affairs. Italy has been especially aggressive in pursuing tech giants. In late 2015, Apple Inc. agreed to pay about EUR318 million to end a dispute in which the company allegedly failed to pay almost EUR900 million in taxes between 2008 and 2013. Other U.S. multinationals, including Amazon.com and Facebook Inc., are also under scrutiny in Italy. Tax police have told Amazon they believe the company has evaded around EUR130 million of taxes in Italy on EUR2.5 billion in sales effected through the company's Italian website between 2011 and 2015, according to people familiar with the matter. In a statement, Amazon said it pays ""all the taxes we are required to pay in every country where we operate."" ""Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business,"" said Amazon, which has invested EUR800 million in Italy since 2010. People familiar with the situation say an Italian investigation into Facebook is also continuing. Facebook didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.

But, unlike so many other notable business leaders, he’s not exactly sounding the alarm. In fact, he used these words to describe his stance: He went on to explain his view. “I’ve just decided I’m going to be contrarian, because the data supports me, and it’s more fun to be in opposition anyway,” Schmidt said, as quoted by CNBC. “There’s no question that there’s job dislocation. But there [are] always new solutions. The economic folks would say that you can see the job that’s lost, but you very seldom can see the job that’s created.” Self-aware robots aside, Schmidt also vented on limitations on hiring skilled immigrants, saying policy restrictions like that make it tougher for the U.S. companies compete on the global stage. “The stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas,” he said. “We want the best people in the world, regardless of any form of sex, race, country, what-have-you. We want them to work for us and not our competitors.” ",Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt says he’s a ‘denier’ when it comes to the robot revolution - MarketWatch

Paul Gillin UPDATED 00:31 EST . 25 APRIL 2017 Four of the tech industry’s giants will report earnings results today, hoping cloud computing will boost their fortunes. Early earnings reports for the first calendar quarter provided some signs that the cloud is helping some tech stalwarts. IBM Corp. saw its shares fall last week on yet another quarterly revenue decline, but cloud growth was strong. And on Tuesday, SAP’s shares waffled as it fell short on profits but it turned in strong cloud subscription revenue. There’s not a lot of room for error from investors’ point of view. Even though share prices modestly declined the first half of April, technology shares are still up an average of 10 percent in 2017, compared with 4 percent for the overall market. Among the four major companies reporting Thursday, Amazon.com Inc. hit a peak of 20 percent above its year-end close. Google Inc. parent Alphabet Inc. climbed 8 percent and Microsoft Corp. was up 5 percent. Only Intel Corp. has declined. Experts say the recent run-up has been fueled by investors who are seeking growth now that hopes have dimmed for near-term big tax cuts or infrastructure spending by the new administration. That prospect had driven price-to-earnings multiples for some companies into the stratosphere. Amazon’s P/E ratio, for instance, is 180. One thing likely will emerge from the first-quarter performance: Leaders in mobility and the cloud are in favor. “The ongoing movement toward cloud services is not only being fueled by the mainstream acceptance of these on-demand alternatives, but also by the continued economic uncertainties facing companies in an increasingly volatile global environment,” said Jeff Kaplan, managing director at THINKstrategies Inc., a cloud consulting firm. Here’s the outlook for companies reporting later Thursday afternoon: Ralph Finos, an analyst with Wikibon, owned by the same company as SiliconANGLE, expects Amazon to report $3.74 billion in quarterly revenue from its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, up 46 percent from the same quarter last year. Analysts are estimating overall quarterly earnings per share will be about $1.13. In recent quarters, virtually all of Amazon’s operating profits have come from AWS. Finos thinks No. 2 cloud player Microsoft will grow its Intelligent Cloud business about 9 percent to $6.45 billion and the Azure infrastructure-as a service business between 90 and 100 percent. In handily beating sales and earnings estimates in the most recent quarter, Microsoft reported 95 percent growth in its Azure business, with Office 365 successfully baiting the hook for many enterprises to move cloudward. Analysts are looking for a 69-cent EPS in the quarter. Cloud computing remains a tiny portion of revenue for Alphabet despite Google’s accelerating focus on new cloud services and infrastructure spending since at least 2015. Investors will certainly have questions about its cloud operation, mostly how much Google is spending to build it up. But shares no doubt will turn more on how its massive advertising business performs. Analyst are looking for profits of $7.40 a share on a 20 percent jump in revenue, to $24.2 billion. Intel is in transition as it sheds no-growth business such as security and places big bets on nascent markets such as autonomous vehicles. Investor expectations are modest as a result. Analysts expect Intel to report quarterly revenue of $14.81 billion, up about 7 percent. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he’ll be looking for statements about how Intel is coping with new competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He’ll also be listening for news of whether a modest revival in PC sales is trickling down to the bottom line and when investors should expect to see results of recently announced artificial intelligence and cloud initiatives.

Jurica Dujmovic,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: May 2, 2017 2:21 p.m. ET Will Facebook, Apple or Microsoft win the race to create a lightweight, AR/VR device that looks just like your regular glasses? By If there’s one thing I always take with me, it’s my smartphone. I’m sure most of you do too. But what if I told you that the device you may be holding in your hands while you read this article could reach the end of its road? At first it seems unlikely that these devices that get bigger, slimmer, stronger and better every couple of months could soon become a thing of the past. Global smartphone sales have risen from $330.4 billion in 2013 to $428.9 billion in 2016, and there is no indication this trend might soon change. But hear me out. New technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality have proven to be more than just a fad. They’re also the best candidates for a gadget that could replace our smartphones. The first signs of change are already here: smartphones that provide AR functionality and can be inserted into various VR headsets and used for experiencing VR content. However, they’re definitely not ideal for this specific task; waving a screen slab in front of your face isn’t just weird, it’s also impractical. Not to mention that they get really hot! We still use smartphones simply because — at the moment — they’re the smallest, lightest, and the most powerful mobile devices out there. But what if there is better, more elegant solution — a lightweight, AR/VR device that looks just like your regular glasses? It would offer the same features as our smartphones and more: Put on AR/VR glasses and you could read your baby’s temperature at a glance, or translate texts and spoken language in real time — without looking down at your phone. I know what you’re thinking: the flop that is Google Glass. To that I say you’re right — but also wrong. Remember that modern VR is built on failures of old, clunky devices of the late 1980s and 1990s. Although VR still hasn’t reached its full potential, it’s already proven its viability by reaching a stage where it provides adequate visual fidelity while being light enough to be worn for prolonged periods. It’s also getting more affordable by the day. Much like these early VR headsets, Google Glass is an interesting concept, but many of its drawbacks and inadequacies indicate that it’s still not mature enough to sway the mainstream market. Instead, it remains a valuable indicator as to what the final form of new and better devices should be.

                                    boss Mark Zuckerberg knows this. He claims AR is the next big thing, and he sees Facebook leading the way. At the company’s annual developer conference a few weeks ago, Facebook unveiled plans to provide developers with the tools that would enable them to build their own AR effects for the Facebook App’s camera. The plan is to use these tools to display information overlay over real-world objects (i.e. the menu at a restaurant), or to create fun and creative overlays, like artwork that appears on blank walls, or virtual furniture that can be moved about the real-world apartment. Zuckerberg wants Facebook to be the first one to provide the hardware, or at least to own the leading platform for the software side of the AR technology. He’s not alone in these ambitions; the same attitude has been echoed by Tim Cook and other tech executives. These glasses would be slick, lightweight head-mounted displays. How would we control them? By tapping them or twirling awkward sliders and pressing the small buttons? Facebook’s solution is to develop brain sensors that will enable you to use the device with the power of your thoughts. As for the audio features, no headphones will be necessary. You will be able to hear sounds simply by wearing the glasses. You see, Facebook is also developing a skin-hearing method. The way I see it, a device that has such an intuitive control scheme and an unobtrusive, familiar ergonomics has a chance to become seamlessly embedded into everyday reality of an average user. Although consumer adoption (and production) of these devices seems to be decades away, it is still causing changes and commotions today within industry giants like Microsoft

In fact, the e-commerce business may not even be the main reason why Amazon is worth so much right now, just as it definitely is not the main reason for Amazon’s recent journey into solid profitability. Amazon Web Services, which sells remote computing power to businesses, was again the star of Amazon’s earnings report, despite being a major concern for investors heading into the report thanks to a decelerating growth rate and rumors that a price war with cloud rivals would shrink profits. However, on the same day that two of those rivals also released earnings, Amazon showed why AWS is the most valuable startup in tech. The company reported quarterly AWS revenue of $3.66 billion, slightly topping estimates and reflecting 42.6% growth, and operating income of $890 million. That net profit margin of more than 24% was actually higher than the year-ago quarter, wiping away more fears. Amazon’s total operating income for the quarter was $1.01 billion. While it doesn’t take a math wizard to see that Amazon would not be anywhere near as profitable without AWS, here is the figure: AWS accounted for about 89% of Amazon’s total operating income for the quarter, with the rest attributable to e-commerce. Cloud computing is a young business, and AWS appears to easily be the leader in the category. Synergy Research reports that Amazon has about 40% of the market, while Microsoft Corp.

                                   combine to hold just 23%. While Microsoft and Alphabet both reported earnings Thursday along with Amazon, neither break out their cloud-computing performance independently, as Microsoft bundles its Azure offering with server sales and other enterprise services, and Google groups Google Cloud Platform’s performance with a host of other non-advertising revenue sources. Talk to anyone who invests in young companies, and they will tell you that this type of performance is incredible. To hold a dominant position in a growing industry with strong profitability and high revenue growth rates is nearly impossible — young companies tend to toss away at least one of those, almost always profitability. Take, for instance, Uber Technologies Inc., the most highly valued of Silicon Valley’s unicorn crop. Recent financials obtained by Bloomberg News showed that Uber roughly doubled its revenue in 2016 while holding a dominant position in the young ride-hailing-app sector. But the company, which is valued at nearly $70 billion on the private market, lost at least $2.8 billion, and likely much more. So, while Uber was reportedly losing billions on $6.5 billion in revenue in 2016, AWS reported operating income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $12.2 billion. That should tell you that, if Uber is worth anywhere near the $70 billion price tag investors have placed on it, then AWS would be worth substantially more as a stand-alone startup. When Amazon stock hits new records Friday, internet commenters and television pundits will rant about the high price-to-earnings ratio and unsustainable valuation. But when you add a company that could be considered the most valuable technology startup in a world full of valuable tech startups, to a web retailer with the scale and reach of Amazon, it shouldn’t be that hard to figure out why this company is worth so much. Amazon shares have gained 24% in 2017, while the S&P 500

George Friedman,05042017,MarketWatch,04272017,"Published: May 2, 2017 11:38 a.m. ET When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches cold By A recession in the United States is likely to come within the next two years. It is difficult to determine when a recession will occur based solely on economic activity. Economists argue about the precursors to a recession as a matter of course. I am not making the case that one will happen because I believe I am competent to enter that debate. Rather, I am making the case that a recession is increasingly likely simply by looking at the frequency with which they occur. The last recession started in 2007 and ended in 2009. The one before that started and ended in 2001. The two previous recessions ran from 1990 to 1991 and from 1981 to 1982. In these cases, the time between the end of one recession and the start of another was about eight years on average. Between 1945 and 1981, recessions were much more frequent, but obviously something has happened to extend the time between them. Eight years have passed since the last recession, and the U.S. is in the zone for one based on its experience since 1980. A recession is likely sometime between now and 2019. It is always possible that we will set a new post-war record for expansion, but that is unlikely simply because periodic recessions are necessary. During expansions, economies tend to accumulate inefficiencies. Low interest rates allow businesses to survive despite their inefficiency, and this will continue if a recession does not occur. In the current expansion, we have had extraordinarily low interest rates, so even with relatively low growth rates, pruning is needed. Recessions are unpleasant and hurt some people disproportionately. However, the U.S. recession will likely hurt other countries more. When combined with other global economic problems, the recession will likely weaken Europe’s anemic recovery and strike another blow at the Chinese. It will also put further downward pressure on commodity prices, considering that the United States is the world’s largest importer and has been, to some extent, the engine stabilizing the international system. The 2007-09 recession hurt the Chinese tremendously because their biggest export customers were the United States and Europe. In due course, the Chinese slowdown cut China’s consumption of industrial commodities, including oil, hitting countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia. This is part of the global exporters’ crisis I have written about previously. The U.S. avoided the worst of this because, while it is the second-largest exporter in the world, exports account for only about 12.6% of its GDP (the U.S. ranks only 161st in the world in terms of exports as a percent of GDP, according to the World Bank). In part, this lack of dependence on exports helped U.S. GDP grow on its internal engine. More important is that the U.S. is less vulnerable to global downturns than other countries. The decline in the U.S. economy will inevitably involve a drop in U.S. imports. Under normal circumstances, this slump would not destabilize the system. But we have not been living under normal circumstances since 2008. More precisely, we are now living in a new normal. In the new normal, countries that were driven by exports are now using diminished export demand to simply maintain their economies in the hopes of generating enough domestic demand to replace lost markets. In most cases, they have achieved a fairly precarious balance at this point that is much more subject to destabilization than in previous cycles. A relatively small drop in global demand can have a substantial impact. Thus, a routine U.S. recession will lead to a small global decline, reversing gains in stabilization made in recent years. The downturn in export demand will have a ripple effect because exporting countries are also importing countries. As American demand contracts, exporters’ economies will be affected and their need for imports will contract as well. This domino effect is normal. The problem is that the international system’s vulnerability has grown dramatically because many countries have become excessively reliant on exports, and this has been accompanied by a general weakness in their domestic economies. Therefore, the ripple effect, while not a tidal wave, will be more substantial than would have been the case before 2008. The most significant vulnerable countries will be the exporters of manufactured products and industrial commodities, particularly oil. The Chinese and the Germans are the most important examples, given that they are the world’s second- and fourth-largest economies. The Chinese have reduced their reliance on exports as a percent of GDP to some extent, but they remain heavily dependent. They have decreased their dependence by increasing domestic consumption, but this has also led to a decline in their growth rate target to what China claims is a sustainable 6.5% a year. A drop in exports would make even this target harder to hit and would limit China’s ability to build domestic demand by contracting exports too quickly. However, Germany’s export dependence has always troubled us the most. With 46.8% of its GDP derived from exports and its banking system in an extraordinarily weak position, Germany needs a stable export base. With the Middle East in chaos and suffering from low oil prices, as are the Russians, Germany’s export purchasers are the Europeans, the Chinese and the Americans. If the appetite for German exports in the U.S. and China declines, it will also affect Germany’s European partners. Thus, the Germans would have trouble maintaining their export rates in the face of a U.S. recession. A U.S. recession would also put heavy pressure on oil prices. The Saudi-Russian attempt to raise oil prices has pretty much failed. The price of oil is now subject to market forces rather than any concerted action by oil exporters. Historically, as oil prices fell, industrial production increased. That is no longer the case because the problem now is finding customers at any price, not keeping production costs low. Lower oil prices might solve a few problems for exporters of manufactured goods, but they create massive problems for oil exporters. The most important consequence of this contraction will be on internal social and political forces. A European recession over the next couple of years would increase the pain in southern Europe and likely spread it north. This would strengthen those challenging the European political elites and increase the demand for protectionism. It would present a challenge to the EU and bolster the idea that the flow of goods without any national controls exposes all countries to the consequences of systemic failure. The argument will be that, if the system is failing, remaining part of the system makes little sense. In China, where political stabilization has been imposed by a dictatorship, the dictator’s credibility will be questioned if Chinese growth rates continue to fall. President Xi Jinping has promised the Chinese a graceful transition from an export-focused economy to one driven by internal demand. To do this, he must control social and political challenges, and maintain a careful and shifting balance between exports and domestic growth. A sudden buckling of exports would make this difficult. As for Russia and Saudi Arabia, should oil prices be stuck below $50 a barrel, the pressure on these countries’ economies will increase. Both will try to manage their regional interests in the face of deepening internal challenges. The credibility of these regimes depends on their ability to maintain a degree of well-being appropriate to their historical patterns. Those patterns will be difficult to preserve. The U.S. will suffer in this situation, but it will not face fundamental crises. However, a recession in the next two years would happen during Donald Trump’s presidency. The American public tends to hold presidents responsible for the economy, even though they have no control over what happens. Therefore, a recession would place Trump in a difficult political position moving toward the 2020 election. The United States would not be as exposed as export-dependent nations, but the political repercussions would require Trump to have established a solid and stable political base by the recession’s onset. I have no econometric model predicting a recession, although I am not sure that these models have been consistently effective predictors. Rather, I am noting that we are eight years from the last recession, and 10 years has been the longest period between recessions. The precursors to a depression — such as irrational exuberance of asset classes, rising interest rates, a negative yield curve, and proclamations that “this time, it’s different” — have at most been modestly appearing. But the clock is ticking. We may set new records on this expansion, but I find it much more likely that a necessary cyclical recession will take place within the next two years. I am arguing that this time it will be different, in the sense that even a relatively mild U.S. recession will have global implications.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"MILAN (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s  Google has agreed to pay 306 million euros ($334 million) to settle a tax dispute with Italy, the company and the country’s tax authority said on Thursday. Last year Italian tax police alleged that Google had not paid tax on about 1 billion euros of Italian revenue between 2009 and 2013. “In addition to the taxes already paid in Italy during those years, Google will pay another 306 million euros,” a spokeswoman for the U.S. company said in an email. Both Google and the Italian tax office said the agreement covered the years between 2002 and 2015. Alphabet has been accused in Italy and other countries of avoiding taxes by booking income earned in higher-taxing European markets through a unit based in low-tax Ireland. The U.S. company has previously said it complied with tax rules in every country it worked. In a separate statement on Thursday the Italian tax office said the amount of more than 306 million euros which Google would pay was referenced to both Google Italy and Google Ireland units. “With Google a process will be kicked off to come up with preventive agreements for correct taxation in Italy in the future for operations that regard our country,” the tax office said.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday turned up the heat on other technology giants by launching new image and video recognition products which could help it court businesses worried about running ads next to offensive content. The Redmond, Washington-based company said its new Video Indexer can identify faces, voices and emotions in moving pictures. Separately, its Custom Vision Search lets companies build apps that recognize images with just a few lines of code. For brands, knowing what’s in the videos that they sponsor has become a hot-button issue since major companies began canceling ad deals with Alphabet Inc’s Google this year over hate speech playing on its subsidiary YouTube. Microsoft’s Video Indexer has similarities to a tool Google launched in March; Amazon.com Inc also said last month it could flag insulting images via a cloud-based service. Microsoft’s latest moves underscore how its focus has evolved from its staple Windows software to the cloud, where it is competing with Amazon to sell data storage and computing power. Extra analytics such as image recognition may prove key to luring Web developers. “It’s hard to understand what’s in the video” the longer it is, said Irving Kwong, a senior product director at Microsoft, in an interview ahead of the company’s developer conference Build. He said Video Indexer, which analyzes videos far faster than humans can, could help a user “harness and get more out of the video content that you have.” The tools launched in preview by the Microsoft Cognitive Services unit on Wednesday, including a decision recommendation service, have one aim apart from winning business: data. Microsoft views the tools as a way to put powerful computing into people’s hands and improve the tools at the same time, because processing more data is key to reaching artificial intelligence. Others including Amazon are pursuing this strategy, with the prize being a new revenue stream. Research firm International Data Corporation has forecast the market for such tools will balloon to over $47 billion in sales in 2020 from $8 billion in 2016. Microsoft pulled back the curtain on experiments that are further afield, too. It announced a new Cognitive Labs unit and the so-called Project Prague: technology to allow people to control computers simply with hand gestures. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy that it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on Apple’s iOS software. “Considering online platforms ‘key gatekeepers’ deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016,” EDiMA said in a statement. However, some in the music industry welcomed the initiative, saying unfair trading practices had become commonplace in the online environment. “There is a ‘power gap’ that distorts competition – it needs to be addressed and we hope the Commission’s upcoming proposals in this area will be up to the task,” said Helen Smith of IMPALA, the Independent Music Companies Association. The Commission’s mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission’s mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a “good Samaritan” principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localization rules hamper technological innovation.

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is dominating the nascent market for voice-controlled speakers, research firm eMarketer said on Monday. The e-commerce giant’s Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices will claim a 70.6 percent share of the U.S. market this year, the study found. The speakers feature Alexa, Amazon’s voice-controlled aide, which users can tell to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights. That puts it far ahead of Alphabet Inc’s Google Home, a similar gadget that has a 23.8 percent share, and less successful offerings from other tech companies. The number of active U.S. users will more than double for the devices this year, to 35.6 million, eMarketer said. The report underscores Amazon’s progress in making Alexa and its speech-recognition technology an integral part of customers’ lives. More users means more data that can improve Alexa’s understanding and could make it a top platform for voice, like Windows is for desktop. Amazon does not disclose Echo sales figures but has said it had trouble keeping the product in stock. Device sales and extra revenue from shoppers placing orders via Alexa could generate $10 billion for Amazon by 2020, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a recent note. And that does not include potential revenue from others using Alexa as a platform. Google’s share is expected to grow, though. Tests by analysts have shown the technology underpinning the Google Home to match or be superior to competitors. A survey by Mahaney found the device’s brand awareness in the United States already equaled 80 percent of Alexa’s, despite being on the market for fewer months. The statistics from eMarketer focused on speakers and left out other virtual assistants: notably, Apple Inc’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. More than 60 million in the United States will use virtual assistants at least once monthly in 2017, the report said. That’s over a quarter of U.S. smartphone users. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided “material support” to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. “For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,” family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook’s co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the   nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria’s government should simplify taxes and reduce fees involved in laying fibre optic cables to encourage development of infrastructure for the technology industry, Google’s manager in the West African country said on Tuesday. Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor told Reuters boosting the technology industry would help diversify Nigeria’s oil-dependent economy, the largest in Africa and which is now in its second year of a recession caused mainly by low crude prices. The Budget and National Planning Ministry said in March the government should encourage local production of technology hardware to reduce dependence on imports and generate foreign exchange. The government aims to create 2.5 million new technology jobs in 2017-2020 via a state-run training programme. “The private sector can play a very strong role,” Ehimuan-Chiazor said, adding that internet service providers regularly complained that multiple taxes at the federal and state level raised the cost of expanding the required infrastructure. “Where the government can help is just removing some of those obstacles - for example, bringing down right of way fees and removing this challenge around multiple taxation,” she said. Right of way fees are the charges paid when securing permission to lay cables. A reduction of fees by Lagos state government helped bring fast broadband to Yaba, a district of commercial capital that is now Nigeria’s technology hub. Ehimuan-Chiazor said Google had laid fibre optic cables in Uganda’s capital Kampala and in Abidjan in Ivory Coast, but said it had no similar plans in Nigeria. A spokesman for the Communications Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Facebook must remove postings deemed as hate speech, an Austrian court has ruled, in a legal victory for campaigners who want to force social media companies to combat online “trolling”. The case - brought by Austria’s Green party over insults to its leader - has international ramifications as the court ruled the postings must be deleted across the platform and not just in Austria, a point that had been left open in an initial ruling. The case comes as legislators around Europe are considering ways of forcing Facebook, Google, Twitter and others to rapidly remove hate speech or incitement to violence. Germany’s cabinet approved a plan last month to fine social networks up to 50 million euros ($55 million) if they fail to remove such postings quickly and the European Union is considering new EU-wide rules. Facebook’s lawyers in Vienna declined to comment on the ruling, which was distributed by the Greens and confirmed by a court spokesman, and Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Strengthening the earlier ruling, the Viennese appeals court ruled on Friday that Facebook must remove the postings against Greens leader Eva Glawischnig as well as any verbatim repostings, and said merely blocking them in Austria without deleting them for users abroad was not sufficient. The court added it was easy for Facebook to automate this process. It said, however, that Facebook could not be expected to trawl through content to find posts that are similar, rather than identical, to ones already identified as hate speech. The Greens hope to get the ruling strengthened further at Austria’s highest court. They want the court to demand Facebook remove similar - not only identical - postings, and to make it identify holders of fake accounts. The Greens also want Facebook to pay damages, which would make it easier for individuals in similar cases to take the financial risk of taking legal action. “Facebook must put up with the accusation that it is the world’s biggest platform for hate and that it is doing nothing against this,” said Green parliamentarian Dieter Brosz. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said hate speech has no place on the platform and the company has published a policy paper on how it wants to work against false news. ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon’s data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon’s technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. “Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard,” said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any “campaign” to stop them. “Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site,” she said. Still, she said, “we prioritize humans over bots as needed.” Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company’s technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it’s proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market’s bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals’ pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others’ price moves for even 20 minutes. “That’s like a lifetime during Christmas,” said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. “If we’re not decently priced, we’ll see it almost immediately” in sales declines. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what’s known as a “CAPTCHA” - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can’t. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. “It is an arms race,” said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. “Every week or every month, there’s some new approach from both sides.” Amazon’s maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De’Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer’s website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon’s price for the De’Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. Despite Amazon’s capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals’ data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. [For full patent record - click tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYwp] “Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it,” said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That “isn’t the case for most retailers.” ","

,05112017,Reuters,05042017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton unveiled his first major personnel decision on Tuesday, saying he had hired an attorney who worked on prominent initial public offerings to lead the SEC’s division that oversees public company filings. The SEC said William Hinman, a retired partner at the Silicon Valley office of the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, will serve as director of the Division of Corporation Finance. According to his old law firm biography, Hinman worked on many high-profile IPOs, including those of Facebook, Google and Alibaba - an IPO that Clayton also worked on while he was a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. “Bill is widely recognized for his judgment and expertise in the area of corporate finance,” Clayton said in a statement. “He has spent the last 37 years working in our public and private markets, and he understands the SEC’s mission.” The announcement came shortly after Clayton held a townhall-style meeting with all of the SEC’s staff, in which he cited capital formation among his top priorities, according to a person who attended. The top Corporation Finance Division post will be crucial because of the unit’s role in writing rules that govern public and private capital-raising. President Donald Trump’s administration has urged government regulators to focus their efforts on finding ways to cut back or decrease regulations that might hinder job creation or economic growth. As SEC Chairman, Clayton is expected to take steps that could make it easier for mid-sized private companies to take the next step and go public. Wall Street financiers have blamed certain post-financial crisis disclosure rules and regulations adopted in the wake of major accounting scandals in the early 2000s for contributing to an ongoing IPO drought. As director of Corporation Finance, Hinman will help craft any new rules for public and private offerings.

But another big player in cloud computing—Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOG)—isn’t deterred, with Tariq Shaukat, president of customers at Google Cloud, saying in an interview with CNBC that Google won’t get involved in a price war. ""We don't need to compete on price, to be honest. We definitely compete on value more than price … but if you look at the products, [they] are hard to compare side by side,"" Shaukat told CNBC in a phone interview Friday. ""We believe that our pricing models are much friendlier. So just simply by adopting the more flexible pricing models we have, things like billing by the minute rather than the hour, we think we can save a typical company 20 to 30% without having a unit price different to the competition."" (See also: Two Announcements From Google's Cloud Conference.) Concerns about a price war in the cloud market started last year when Amazon and Google both moved to lower the prices on some of their cloud offerings. Microsoft took a page from both companies in 2017, also reducing the prices on some of its offerings, prompting analysts to worry it’s the start of a price war that could negatively impact all three companies’ margins. There’s also increased competition from the likes of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. (BABA) and Tencent of China, which could also weigh on prices. (See also: Alibaba Facing More Cloud Competition From Rival Tencent.) Google’s Shaukat argued that while price does matter, customers aren’t looking at that alone. Rather, they are gauging the value they will get from going with one cloud computing provider over the other. For instance, the Google exec pointed to data analysis, artificial intelligence and machine learning built into its offerings as differentiators. Google has been pouring billions of dollars into its cloud business, with CNBC pegging the total investment so far at $30 billion. This year alone, Google has expanded into new regions as part of its global expansion, noted CNBC. In April, Diane Greene, the head of Google’s cloud unit, said Google could surpass market leader Amazon Web Services by 2020. Those comments were echoed by Shaukat in his CNBC interview Friday. ""Within five years we can overtake Amazon in the market and that is all based on this idea that only 5 percent of workloads are currently in the cloud that could go into the cloud. What happens today is not a terribly good predictor of what is going to happen in the future,"" Shaukat said in the CNBC interview. ",Google: No to Price War Over Cloud Computing | Investopedia

During an event for advertisers held in New York on Thursday, Google said it would create more than 40 new shows for YouTube with big names including comedian Kevin Hart and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, who are creating shows that will debut on YouTube later in 2017. Google is reportedly spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the efforts, reported Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter. Google's plan is to lure big-name advertisers like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which is the exclusive sponsor for its upcoming music competition show “Best.Cover.Ever” hosted by Ryan Seacrest. ""We’re excited to partner with top creators and world-class production companies to offer these new shows to audiences globally—on the platform where the world chooses to watch over a billion hours of video every day,"" the company said on the official YouTube blog. (See also: Google Launches New YouTube Site to Select Users.) For Google and its YouTube platform, the move to create original content comes amid a backlash from advertisers over the placement of ads alongside questionable and controversial content. In March, Martin Sorrell, the CEO of advertising company WPP Group, warned the likes of Google and Facebook (FB) that they have to control where the advertisements are placed as well as clamp down on fake news that shows up in their feeds and online or risk losing advertisers. Amid all the controversy, Google has been taking steps to improve the placement of ads and to stop the spread of fake news on the Internet. (See also: Google Moves to Clean Up Fake News In Search) While the controversy has done little to hurt sales at Google, there are some advertisers who are still concerned that YouTube relies too much on videos made by users that could result in ads ending up alongside offensive content. The push to create television show-like content with big name celebrities is an effort to assuage some of those worries. According to Bloomberg, the idea of funding programs on YouTube that are ad-supported came about more than a year ago after company executives saw a study that showed many of the new shows that are popping up online are via premium services that do not have ads associated with them. Google saw an opening to offer free content to users and make money off the ads.  “We’re turning the infrastructure we’ve built for original programming into supporting our biggest partners,’’ Robert Kyncl, YouTube’s chief business officer told Bloomberg. “Nobody is doing it the way we are.

The company reported first quarter 2017 net revenue grew by 24% y/y to $197.3 million. The company saw a GAAP net loss of $4.8 million or $0.06 per share versus a loss of $15.5 million y/y. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $29.3 million, up from $13.0 million y/y. Adjusted net income of $16.3 million or $0.19 per diluted share, and increase from $6.0 million or $0.08 y/y.  Analysts had been looking for YELP to report adjusted EPS of $0.16 and revenue of $198.50 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $26.88 million. Revenue was a touch light, while adjusted EPS and EBITDA came better than expected. For the second quarter of 2017, the company is expecting revenue in the range of $202 million to $206 million, or $204 million at the mid-point. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be in a range of $32 million to $35 million, $33.5 million at the mid-point. For full year 2017, the company is looking for revenue in a range of $850 million to $865 million, $857.5 million at the mid-point, while adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $130 to $145 million, $137.5 million at the mid-point. Analysts had been looking for revenue to for the second quarter of $215.29 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $36.87 million. The second quarter outlook the company provided was a big miss. For the full year, analysts had been looking for revenue of $889.46 million and adjusted EBITDA of $160.67 million, again a big miss on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. On the company's conference call, Yelp cited the reason for the reduction in the outlook was due to a decline in revenue retention in the local ad business in the first quarter, which had an outsized impact on full-year results. The company said the primary factor in the change of outlook was due to local revenue challenges. Yelp's results clash strongly with what Google (GOOGL, GOOG) mentioned on their recent conference call. In the call, Google said that over the past year local shopping queries have increased by 45 percent while the number of retailers providing them with local inventory feeds doubled.

In a blog post, Nicolas Koumchatzky, a Twitter software engineer, said the website's tweet-ranking algorithm is using modeling capabilities and an AI platform built by one of its in-house AI teams. Koumchatzky said it means that more relevant timelines will be offered up to users. (See also: Microsoft's Venture Arm Invests in 2 AI Startups) “This opens the door for us to use more of the many novelties that the deep learning community has to offer, especially in the areas of NLP (Natural Language Processing), conversation understanding, and media domains,” wrote the engineer. Up until Twitter incorporated AI into its tweet ranking algorithms, Koumchatzky said users’ timelines were filled with all the Tweets people followed since the last visit, shown in reverse chronological order. “Although the concept is simple to grasp, reliably serving this experience to the hundreds of millions of people on Twitter is an enormous infrastructural and operational challenge,” Koumchatzky wrote. With the AI-based algorithm, in order to predict which tweet will be engaging to users, the model looks at the tweet itself including the total interactions, the author of the tweet and the past interactions the person had with the author and the tweets a user found engaging in the past, among other things. Koumchatzky noted that thanks to AI it is able to evaluate and score thousands of tweets per second for its 328 million monthly active users which should pay off for the social media network operator.

Other analysts argue that valuations are worth every penny, at least among the index’s largest constituents. (See also: What are the early warning signs of a tech bubble?) In its latest portfolio strategy research note, Goldman Sachs claimed that encouraging trends should see the Nasdaq 100, which returned 32 percent over the past 12 months — versus the 19 percent return posted by the S&P 500 — continue to outperform the wider market this year and in 2018. However, the bank adds that returns from better sales and earnings growth will be less spectacular, due to higher valuations. Driving Goldman's optimism is a healthier economic environment, which generally tends to boost consumer spending and explosive growth stocks, and a recognition that the five largest names within the Nasdaq 100 index are well positioned to benefit from big technological changes. While the S&P 500 is fairly evenly distributed, Goldman Sachs notes that 42 percent of the Nasdaq 100 is made up of just five companies. Together, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) beat the S&P 500 year-to-date by an average of 16 percentage points, an impressive run that the investment bank estimates is likely to continue. Apple, which accounts for a whopping 12 percent of the Nasdaq 100, is expected to enjoy another stellar year, driven by the launch of new products and growth in service revenues. Moreover, Goldman believes that Google’s exposure to buoyant advertising, mobile search and enterprise cloud computing markets can help the company to deliver a 19 percent rise in 2018 sales. (See also: How Far Will Apple's Stock Run?) Elsewhere, Goldman’s analysts are confident that Microsoft will benefit from expense discipline, Facebook from its exposure to “one of the best secular growth markets” and Amazon from the ongoing shifts to cloud computing and online retailing, which it claims have yet to be fully factored into consensus estimates. Next year, consensus forecasts have penciled in Nasdaq 100 sales and earnings growth of 8.4 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively, versus the 5.3 percent and 9.7 percent expected from the S&P 500, according to Goldman. Technology stocks are also expected to outperform throughout the rest of 2017, albeit at a slower rate. “2017 estimates are mixed,” the bank’s analyst said. “Nasdaq 100 sales in 2017 are forecast to grow by 8.3 percent vesus 7.5 percent for the overall S&P 500 (5.3 percent excluding energy), the smallest gap since 2008.” (See also: Goldman Sachs Favors Equities in Europe Over U.S.) ","Nasdaq 100 Will Continue to Outperform S&P 500: Goldman Sachs (AAPL, GOOG) | Investopedia"

The Trump bump and earnings that surpassed analyst expectations have pushed stock prices for technology behemoths to record highs in public markets. In turn, analysts are predicting trillion-dollar valuations for three companies. For example, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler recently wrote that Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is likely to become one of the first trillion-dollar market cap companies. ""It's just a question of when, and not if, in our view,"" he wrote. Brian White from Drexel Hamilton made a similar prediction for Apple Inc. (AAPL). In his note, White attributed the increase to the Cupertino, California-based company's current depressed valuation, anticipated stock dividends and potential new innovations. (See also: Amazon Hits All-Time High as Analyst Predicts $1 Trillion Market Cap.) Amazon ranks third behind Apple and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) in terms of market capitalization. As of this writing, Amazon is valued at $453.62 billion in the public markets. Apple and Google are valued at $797.77 billion and $652.72 billion, respectively. The following is a brief primer on the three technology companies poised to achieve trillion-dollar market valuation status.  Apple seems to be most likely to move past the trillion-dollar mark first. It had a scorching pace of growth at the turn of this decade. Between 2010 and 2015, the company's revenue increased by an average of $33.74 billion each year. However, its growth numbers have slowed down in recent times as it searches for new markets and growth opportunities. Still, of the three companies listed above, Apple has the healthiest P/E ratio of 17.88, which is slightly lower than the the tech industry's average ratio of 18. In itself, that ratio is a good enough reason to be optimistic about Apple's chances. (See also: How Far Will Apple's Stock Run?) It is a measure of consumer confidence in Apple that the company reported record sales of its iconic iPhones despite its latest edition receiving mostly tepid reviews from users. Investor confidence in the company is not lacking either.  Despite Apple CEO Tim Cook's public opposition to President Donald Trump, the company's stock is up by 32 percent this year. More recently, the company has made gains in the wearable devices category and services business. (See also: Services to Exceed 33% of Apple Gross Profit by 2020: Credit Suisse.) Earlier calculations by Fortune estimated that Apple would need to register earnings growth of 6.2 percent in order to push past the trillion-dollar mark. The magazine estimates that Apple will reach that target by 2021. Considering past numbers, that timeline may be accurate. Earlier, Apple shot up by more than $200 billion in less than three years on the back of positive buzz. It reached a market valuation of $700 billion in February 2015 from $500 billion in 2012.  Alphabet's money-minting advertising juggernaut earned $79.38 billion in revenue last year. That source of revenue is not going away any time soon. Google, as Alphabet was known earlier, and Facebook, Inc. (FB) dominate the digital advertising sweepstakes. Meanwhile, Alphabet has branched into multiple lines of business. These other businesses contribute a miniscule portion of the overall revenue. However, other ventures such as YouTube and cloud computing are growing at a healthy clip. (See also: Facebook, Google Dominate as Mobile Ad Spending Hits Record High.) Alphabet has a P/E ratio of 31.08. This means that investors are expecting returns of approximately 3.2 percent from the stock. The company does not pay out dividends – this is good news for its earnings growth prospects because it means that the company needs to show growth of approximately 5.2 percent annually (adding in 2 percent inflation) in its earnings to achieve the trillion-dollar target. Considering that its income shot up by 22 percent during the last reported fiscal year, Alphabet should not find it too difficult to achieve that target. (See also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Long Term.)  Out of the three companies on this list, Amazon is probably the most unique one. In an earlier interview, venture capitalist and former analyst Gene Munster likened Amazon to a glacier that deliberately moves in a direction and carves up the landscape. The Seattle-based company dominates the e-commerce landscape and is pursuing opportunities in other lucrative industries. Amazon's strategy of operating at low margins and reinvesting its profits back into the business has inflated its P/E ratio but earned the confidence of investors. It has a P/E ratio of 176.56 – this translates into an earnings yield of 0.5 percent. (See also: Jeff Bezos Nets Almost $1 Billion in Amazon Stock Sale.) But investors are banking on opportunities in Amazon's future markets. The market size of opportunities chased by Amazon is big enough to catapult the company toward a trillion-dollar valuation. Consider the math. The market for e-commerce is expected to reach $485 billion in the United States alone. Amazon, which has sizeable operations in Europe and India as well, is the leader in this area. The company also leads the markets in cloud computing and smart assistants by a wide margin.

Time Warner launched HBO Now in 2015 to connect with millennials and audiences who do not have cable subscriptions that consume content across multiple devices. As of February this year, the service had approximately 2 million domestic subscribers. At a subscription rate of $15 per month, that translates to roughly $360 million in annual revenue. It could also be a substantial source of profit for the company in the future. This is because subscribers to the service pay Time Warner directly instead of paying their cable company.

Todd Haselton,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Images of Google's new operating system — which is being built from the ground-up and may power the next-generation of smart devices — recently surfaced online. The new operating system is called Fuchsia and, according to Ars Technica, ditches the traditional Linux code at the heart of Android. It uses something new, currently just called ""Magenta."" Rumors have suggested that Google is looking for a better way to combine the desktop-like and extremely simple environment of Chrome OS with Android, allowing it to sell a more robust portfolio of products. There's even evidence of this; Google hasn't really focused on Android for tablets much, suggesting that perhaps it sees more potential for tablets with different software. Fuchsia could be that combo-operating system. There's evidence that it's already cross platform, which means developers wouldn't need to recreate the millions of Android apps that are already available. The images that were published on Monday are relatively simple in scope. The home screen of one looks like Android, with what appears to be empty areas for widgets. Others seem to show a tabbed interface, perhaps for easily switching between apps as one might toggle between tabs in Chrome. In a tablet mode, there's evidence that Fuchsia may allow up to four apps to run at once. Imagine a busy professional who wants to keep a chat app, email, a browser and a note-taking app all open on the home screen at once. This appears possible in Fuchsia. Ars Technica pointed out that there's no real evidence Google will ever move forward to develop this full time, or if it'll replace Chrome OS and Android entirely. If it does come to fruition, however, we may be looking at very early version of Google's next major operating system. ",Google Fuchsia operating system images appear online
 ,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Family members of three victims of the December 2015 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, have sued Facebook, Google and Twitter, claiming that the companies permitted Islamic State to flourish on social media. The relatives assert that by allowing Islamic State militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided ""material support"" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. ""For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits,"" family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. ""Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,"" the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Islamic State shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Arjun Kharpal,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"A top Apple executive revealed he is not a fan of either Amazon's Echo or Google Home's speakers, amid speculation that the company could be releasing its own rival product. In a recent interview with Gadgets 360, Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, took a dig at the devices—which have voice assistants built in. ""My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all,"" Schiller said. Home and Echo both allow users to speak to them and get responses, or carry out ""smart home"" tasks like managing the thermostat and ensuring security. Apple has yet to release its own product, but a noted analyst recently said that the company is working on a device to rival Amazon and Google. ""There is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June,"" KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note. WWDC is Apple's annual developers conference. Schiller did however give his thoughts on Siri, Apple's own voice assistant, and acknowledged that there are situations where a screen would not be needed. ""For example, if you're driving (and) you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing,"" Schiller said to Gadgets 360. ""Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don't have to walk over and back (and you can use Siri instead)."" He added that while a voice assistant is ""really beneficial"" at times, having access to a touch screen device was still essential. ""So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations,"" the executive told the publication. ""For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do,"" Schiller said.

Arjun Kharpal,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Internet companies like Google and Apple are abusing their power and scale, a number of European technology businesses such as Spotify have claimed. The chief executives of music streaming service Spotify, rival firm Deezer and Rocket Internet among others, sent a letter to the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, claiming that online platforms ""can and do abuse their privileged position"". ""Our collective experience is that where online platforms have a strong incentive to turn into gatekeepers because of their dual role, instead of maximizing consumer welfare,"" the CEOs wrote. The Financial Times first reported the story on Friday, and Business Insider publishing a full copy of the letter on Monday. The European tech firms did not specifically name Google or Apple in the letter but referenced mobile operating systems, app stores, search engines, marketplaces and social media services as examples of the kind of platforms they take issue with. In one part of the letter, the CEOs said examples of platforms turning into gatekeepers include them ""restricting access to data or interaction with consumers, biased ranking and search results to lack of clarity, imbalanced terms and conditions and preference of their own vertically integrated services."" With Google dominating the search market in Europe and its Android mobile operating system along with Apple's iOS making up over 90 percent of the mobile market in the region, it's clear who the chief executives are singling out. Apple and Google were unavailable for comment when contacted by CNBC. The European Commission was also unavailable. The letter was sent to the commission ahead of a midterm review of the Digital Single Market, a policy aimed at harmonized rules across the bloc when it comes to policy around the digital economy. The review is scheduled for Wednesday. Apple and Spotify have clashed in the past. Last year, Spotify sent a letter to Apple accusing it of ""causing grave harm"" to the company and its customers by rejecting an update to the streaming service's iOS app. Spotify has also hit out against the 30 percent charge Apple has on payments made via iTunes. In July, the Swedish firm sent an email to remind customers it was cheaper to sign up to Spotify directly through the company's website than via the App Store.

Chantel McGee,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"If there was any doubt that Silicon Valley hates limitations on hiring skilled immigrants to work in the U.S., Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt made it clear. ""The stupidest policy in the entire American political system was the limit on H-1B visas,"" Schmidt said while speaking at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab on Wednesday. Alphabet is the parent company of Google. ""We want the best people in the world, regardless of any form of sex, race, country, what-have-you. We want them to work for us and not our competitors,"" he said. Policy restrictions like that make it more difficult for U.S. companies to remain competitive, he said. ""We should organize our country to be the most attractive place for those people. Stupid government policies that restrict us from [having] a fair chance of getting those people are antithetical to our mission [and] the things we serve,"" said Schmidt. Schmidt also said that despite the rapid pace of technological advancement he isn't worried about artificial intelligence taking jobs. ""I've taken the position of 'job elimination denier.' I've just decided I'm going to be contrarian, because the data supports me, and it's more fun to be in opposition anyway,"" he said. Still, ""there's no question that there's job dislocation.

Arjun Kharpal,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Google doesn't need to compete on price to beat rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud computing business, a top executive told CNBC, amid concerns that there could be a pricing war as technology firms get aggressive to acquire customers. In a phone interview earlier this week, Tariq Shaukat, president of customers at Google Cloud, said that the company's pricing structure, which allows businesses to pay per minute of usage, is unique. ""We don't need to compete on price to be honest. We definitely compete on value more than price … but if you look at the products, (they) are hard to compare side by side,"" Shaukat told CNBC. ""We believe that our pricing models are much more friendly. So just simply by adopting the more flexible pricing models we have, things like billing by the minute rather than the hour, we think we can save a typical company 20 to 30 percent without having a unit price different to the competition."" Last year, Amazon and Google both cut the price of some of their cloud products, with Microsoft following suit this year. The three are locked in a battle in the cloud space with Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud division, leading the way. Some analysts are concerned that the continued downward spiral of prices could hit margins on some of these businesses. ""I don't think that looking at prices itself as opposed to the value being delivered to the customer is the right way to look at it,"" Shaukat added. Data is key For Google, value means telling prospective and current customers that it is the best at data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. ""Our skill set capability in data management, machine learning, is second to none and we think that will be one of the key adopters in cloud adoption,"" Shaukat said. Google has been investing heavily in AI including via acquisitions, the most notable of which was British company Deepmind for $400 million in 2014. But on top of that, the company has been trying to boost the products it sells via the cloud. For example, it has G Suite - its cloud-based documents, email and calendar applications - that it sells to businesses. Analysts said, however, that compared to Microsoft and Amazon, Google's software applications aren't as wide-ranging, and it's an area the company should focus on. ""When you look at Google you have to say they need to start pushing more services in the software space to compete with Microsoft in that environment,"" Nick McQuire, vice president of enterprise at CCS Insight, told CNBC by phone on Friday. Adding these extra services can help to boost revenue, gain more customers and keep margins healthy, McQuire added. Bid to take on Amazon Still, Google Cloud has gained momentum recently signing large customers like HSBC, adding to its current portfolio which includes the likes of Spotify and Coca-Cola. Google parent company Alphabet does not break out the cloud segment separately in its earnings but instead includes it in the ""other revenues"" section which also includes hardware among other businesses. In the first quarter of 2017, other revenues grew over 49 percent to just over $3 billion. It's still a relatively small business in the context of Alphabet's overall revenues. Meanwhile, AWS alone brought in $3.6 billion for Amazon in the first quarter. But Google is continuing to pick up momentum and has so far invested $30 billion in the cloud business. It is expanding into several new regions this year to expand its global footprint. Last month, the head of Google's cloud business Diane Greene said the company could surpass Amazon as the market leader by 2022. Shaukat cited a report by Deutsche Bank that said cloud providers have only penetrated 5 percent of the market, so there is plenty of room to grow. ""Within five years we can overtake Amazon in the market and that is all based on this idea that only 5 percent of workloads are currently in the cloud that could go into the cloud. What happens today is not a terribly good predictor of what is going to happen in the future,"" Shaukat told CNBC. ","Google touts AI in the cloud to beat Amazon, Microsoft"
Elizabeth Gurdus,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"When Warren Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday that he made a mistake not investing in Alphabet's Google, Jim Cramer reeled at the legendary investor's admission. ""It finally happened! A money manager came on television and admitted that he had made a mistake, that he had an obvious win on his hands and he punted, he didn't take advantage of it,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""That's the good news. Accountability at last."" The bad news was that it happened to be one of the most successful money managers of our time. ""Maybe the takeaway is that only the world's greatest investor can afford to openly admit making a mistake. Everyone else just must be too insecure to do the same thing,"" Cramer said. Watch the full segment here: Buffett's self-proclaimed flubs aside, Cramer touted the investment guru's legacy, from buying into best-of-breed companies trading at discounts to his unrelenting optimism about the future of the United States. ""He's genuinely curious; he's skeptical without being cynical; and despite his folksy demeanor, he doesn't suffer fools gladly, which is why he's willing to make harsh judgments if a CEO's got it wrong,"" as he did with former Wells Fargo chief John Stumpf. All that said, Buffett's statements about his Google miss intrigued Cramer. Buffett admitted that he realized the value of Google early, when Berkshire's auto insurance subsidiary, GEICO, was seeking advertising outlets. Buffett understood the power of Google's advertising business even then. People who wanted to buy insurance quickly would search it via Google for instant gratification. ""He admitted that he recognized Google's cost of taking that ad was virtually nil, that it represented nearly 100 percent profit. He even met with the founders of Google,"" Cramer said. Still, Buffett did not pull the trigger on buying shares, which he attributed in part to being unsure who would ultimately win in the advertising space. Back then, Google, now Alphabet, traded at $300 a share and has since soared to $950. ""What can we learn from this mistake? First, we have to recognize a humbling, humbling thing: stock picking is really difficult. Few people would've had the kind of insight that Buffett had about Google, and yet he didn't buy it,"" Cramer said. Buffett later purchased shares of IBM, a move he would come to see as preemptive because the company's promising technologies did not grow as quickly as he expected. ""When you put Buffett's IBM pick alongside his failure to pull the trigger on Google, you have to conclude that nobody in this business gets it right all the time. If even the 'Oracle of Omaha' can make this kind of mistake, then you can understand why I'm so adamant that you keep your retirement money in a low-cost index fund that mirrors the S&P 500,"" Cramer said. The S&P 500 sidelines the worst companies and benefits from takeover activity, so investing in a low-cost fund like the Buffet-praised Vanguard would be a smart move, Cramer said. ""How about takeaway number two? Once you have your bedrock index fund investment and you keep adding to that every year, if you do have some spare cash, why not try to put it to work in some stocks that you can find yourself?"" the ""Mad Money"" host asked. The best example of this in Buffett's world was his call on Apple. When he saw younger generations glued to their Apple devices, he began to see it not as a technology company, but as a consumer products powerhouse that sold at a major discount to the other consumer goods plays. Even now, measured against similarly structured companies, Apple remains very cheap, Cramer argued. Cramer's final takeaway was that keeping your eyes open is key to picking and buying the right companies at the right time. ""I could argue that Google itself, now that it's expanding beyond just search into YouTube video, data centers, [and] self-driving cars — that may be a big bargain given the misperception that it's still merely a search play hostage to the advertising market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. And while Cramer does not recommend simply piling your favorite companies into a portfolio and hoping things work out, there is much to be said about playing the field like Buffett does. ""If you want to augment your index fund with a few stock picks of your own, I think that's a totally responsible and, frankly, thrilling way to try your hand at growing wealth beyond the ordinary, even if the ordinary has done pretty darned well all by itself,"" Cramer said.

Todd Haselton,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Picture it: you're standing in the kitchen cooking up a saucy chicken dinner with a bottle of BBQ sauce in one hand and the chicken in another. You want to call your brother to check in, but you can't reach for your smartphone on the other side of the kitchen without putting everything down. Your Amazon Echo is on the counter playing Bruce Springsteen while you cook. Instead of drying your hands and picking up the phone, you can now ask Amazon to call any other Alexa user — like your brother. This is a new feature that Amazon announced earlier this week. Alexa users who own an Echo, or who have the app installed on their iOS or Android smartphone, can now call or message one another for free. You can't call individual rooms yet – like from the dining room up to your kid's bedroom, that feature will launch this summer – but you can call other users. I've been testing it for a couple of days and I'm blown away by how fun it is to use Alexa to place calls. I get a genuine buzz of excitement when I see my Echo suddenly light up with a green light, alerting me that a friend is calling. The calls are clear, too, and Amazon even lets you send voice messages (think of them as a voicemail) or text that can be spoken by Alexa to another user. I can clearly see how Amazon may be able to use the Echo to totally disrupt everything from enterprise phone systems to how and when we communicate by voice. Society has moved away from clunky phone systems at home, at least most of us in the younger ""millennial"" generation, but the Echo, which exists as a smart assistant capable of streaming music, providing sports scores, reading the news and more, isn't a boring old phone. Instead, it can simply double as one. And, better yet, there's no monthly fee to use the feature. Want to try it for yourself? We'll walk you through how to get up and running now. The first thing you need to do is make sure you have the latest Alexa app installed on your iPhone or Android smartphone. Open the Alexa app on your smartphone and then tap the chat bubble at the bottom. Now tap the figure in the upper-right hand corner. This will show a list of your contacts who have the updated app and who are available to call or message. You can call right from your phone by tapping a name. Or you can call from your Alexa by saying ""Alexa, call mom."" To answer a call, simply say ""Alexa answer."" To end, say ""Alexa hang up."" That's all there is to it. When you place a call, it'll ring on another user's phone through the Alexa app, or on every Echo connected to their account. If you want, you can send and receive messages using the Alexa app from the same page you'd place a call. Alexa will either play your recorded voice or translate your text and speak out your message on the other end. There are a couple of hiccups Amazon needs to iron out. The call quality is good but not great – voices sounded a bit hollow on my Amazon Echo Dot. Also, the person at the end of the line can hear you say ""Alexa hang up,"" which is sort of awkward. Also you need to ask your friends to update their apps in order for this to work. That isn't always easy. I love the idea, though, and in a world where many of us have ditched landlines entirely, I think the home phone just got a new shot at life. ",How to make calls with Amazon's Alexa

Most companies use stock splits as a way to bring their per-share price down to more manageable levels, which many believe encourages greater liquidity and accessibility to small investors. Yet for tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the company's sole stock split during its history was done for a very different reason: creating a new class of non-voting shares that became a model for peers both in the information technology sector and beyond. Now, as Alphabet's stock price approaches the $1,000-per-share mark, some investors wonder if the parent company of Google will ever do another split. With many companies simply allowing their shares to continue rising, it's entirely possible that shareholders might not get the chance to see another Alphabet stock split going forward. Image source: Alphabet. Since the company formerly known as Google went public in 2004, it has done only one stock split. That came in 2014, when the company moved forward with what might have seemed like a simple 2-for-1 split. However, the mechanics of the split were anything but simple. Instead of using its existing share class and simply issuing more shares, Alphabet issued new non-voting stock in the form of newly created Class C shares. As a result, each shareholder got one Class C non-voting share for every Class A voting share they owned prior to the split. Company executives and other inside investors who owned Class B shares with voting preferences also receive a Class C share for every share they owned. At the time, the move was extremely controversial. Shareholders filed a class action lawsuit, arguing that the split was a thinly veiled effort by top executives to allow them to sell off a portion of their economic interest in Alphabet while still retaining a commanding majority stake for voting purposes, effectively giving them an unbreakable mandate in determining the strategic direction in which the search engine giant would move. It took a year and a half to settle the lawsuit, but eventually Alphabet won the right to go forward with the deal. When the Alphabet split was first announced in early 2012, the stock traded at around $600 per share. That worked out to a roughly $300-per-share valuation for the two classes of stock, with the Class A voting shares trading at a small premium to the Class B non-voting shares. That small difference has generally persisted, albeit with periods of wider and narrower disparities between the two share prices. Over the past five years, though, Alphabet has expanded dramatically. The core Google search business still commands the Alphabet corporate umbrella, but other properties like YouTube and Android are also important contributors to the company's success. In addition to those two divisions, which remain under Google's supervision, companies like the Waymo autonomous vehicle division and the Calico healthcare and aging business are directly controlled by Alphabet. Because of those gains, the stock has once again approached the $1,000 level. That has some thinking that the millennium mark might be a good opportunity for Alphabet to deliver a second stock split. There's certainly precedent for companies choosing not to do stock splits despite having high share prices. You'll find a few stocks that already have topped the $1,000 mark without showing any desire to do a stock split. The ease of trading in single shares rather than 100-share lots has made the price of a particular stock less relevant in terms of liquidity. Long-time investors in Alphabet have gotten good returns on their investment, and decisions to split or not to split Alphabet stock in the future will have no impact on those returns. What's more important is for Alphabet to keep moving forward, getting the most from Google while growing its other businesses to deliver a diversified stream of profits that can last for years into the future. If Alphabet can do that, then shareholders won't care whether a stock split comes or not. ","

Grocery delivery start-up Instacart is just half the age of Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) rival service AmazonFresh, but it's growing up fast. Late last month the delivery service announced a nationwide expansion, opening up new markets in Texas and the Midwest, including Detroit, Columbus, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and Las Vegas. Over the coming weeks, the company will expand to markets in Texas, Florida, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio. Instacart now serves more than 40 metropolitan areas nationwide, compared to just 17 for AmazonFresh in the US. Image source: Amazon. Amazon launched its Fresh grocery delivery service ten years ago, kicking it off in its hometown of Seattle in 2007. It took six more years for the company to bring it to another city, but Amazon has recently been ramping up expansion of the program. It also lowered the price from a $200/year additional charge over Prime to $15/month. The company is also testing other ways of selling groceries, such as its new Amazon Go store, which is only available to employees, and AmazonFresh Pickup, the soon-to-open service that will allow customers to order on their phones and pick up the items. It's clear why Amazon wants to get a foothold in groceries. The $800 billion domestic industry would open up a whole new revenue stream for the company, which it will increasingly need as Prime reaches a saturation point. But Instacart seems to be beating AmazonFresh on almost every front, in addition to the number of markets it's available in and the yearlong free trial for some new members. Instacart is also expanding much faster than AmazonFresh and plans to make its services available to 80% of the country by next year. Here are two key areas where Instacart is beating AmazonFresh: E-commerce seems to be taking over American retail sector by sector, from books to electronics to toys and now apparel. But groceries have remained largely immune to the online channel, as Americans seem to prefer shopping for fresh foods like produce and meat in person. Even AmazonFresh was not a new idea, as Ahold's Peapod delivery service dates back to before the internet. Customers do not seem entirely happy with the service. AmazonFresh rates a middling 3.4 starts on its own site, with 606 reviews. Nearly as many reviewers gave it 1 star as 5 stars. Among the most common complaints were late or inaccurate deliveries and not picking up old delivery totes. Instacart was no better, receiving almost universally low ratings in about 100 reviews on Yelp and Sitejabber. Instacart was recently valued at $3.4 billion in a recent fundraising round, putting it in line with Sprouts Farmers Market, but that value seems to underscore the fact that investors still don't believe in the disruption of delivery in the grocery industry. Disruptors in other industries like Uber and Airbnb are valued at nearly $70 billion and $30 billion respectively. The sum of those factors would seem to bode poorly for AmazonFresh. It's not only losing ground to Instacart, but the market sees little value in grocery delivery itself, especially for a company valued at more than $400 billion. That may explain why Amazon is turning to alternatives to break into the grocery industry, but those have their own challenges as well. Amazon's best move might simply be to buy Instacart, but that would require the company to work directly with the grocers AmazonFresh now competes directly with. Without a clear strategy, AmazonFresh could lose further ground to Instacart, but the start-up's rapid expansion makes it clear that AmazonFresh can't stand still. ","

Signing a mortgage is quite the commitment. Not only are you locked into what could be a sizable monthly payment, but you're also pledging to continue paying that amount every month for up 30 years of your life. And while paying off a mortgage early is easier said than done, here are a few good reasons to eliminate that debt sooner than you technically have to. Countless seniors struggle to pay the bills in retirement, so much so that an estimated 25 million of them live below the poverty line. Since housing is one of the greatest expenses seniors face, it stands to reason that taking your mortgage payment out of the mix can make for a more financially secure retirement. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. One reason so many households struggle to pay for college (aside from the exorbitant price tag, of course) is that their existing bills don't magically go away by the time those tuition payments come due. But if you manage to pay off your mortgage by the time your kids go off to college, you'll have extra cash on hand to cover those costs. Freeing up cash for college will help you and your children avoid hefty loans -- loans that countless borrowers struggle to pay off. Last year, the average college grad came away over $37,000 in debt, so if paying off your mortgage early cuts that number significantly, your kids will have a much less stressful start to adulthood. Mortgage lenders make money by collecting interest, so the sooner you pay off your home loan, the less it'll ultimately cost you. Imagine you have a 30-year, $300,000 fixed mortgage at 4% interest. Now let's say that 10 years in, you make an extra $10,000 payment toward your principal. That move alone will save you close to $12,000 in interest -- money that go a long way toward retirement, college, or whatever other purpose you choose to use it for. While paying off your mortgage early might seem appealing in theory, it's a harder feat to accomplish in practice. But if you're willing to make the effort, here are a few tips that'll help you eliminate that debt sooner: One final thing: While paying off your mortgage early can open the door to major savings and give you more financial flexibility to meet different goals, make sure your loan doesn't impose penalties for prepayment. While most mortgages don't penalize borrowers for paying off their debt early, some do, so it's important to weigh your prospective savings against the fees you'll be charged. ","

Danny Vena,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Rumors about larger companies acquiring smaller upstarts are not uncommon, and in the majority of cases, investors would do well to ignore the gossip mill. Sometimes, however, investors can gain valuable insight, and it's worth taking the time to examine the story to see if the combination would be a winning fit. When rumors surfaced last month that e-commerce facilitator eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) was looking to acquire Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), it seemed plausible; Shopify's stock jumped on the news. After all, both companies are engaged in the realm of online selling, and at first glance, it seems like it might be a good match. A closer examination, however, shows that looks can be deceiving. Is eBay looking to buy Shopify? Image source: eBay. If you haven't heard of Shopify, you're probably not alone. The company went public less than two years ago, but the stock has been on fire ever since. Shopify provides an e-commerce and payment platform to small and medium-sized businesses that is easy to use and provides over 1,000 apps that allow them to customize the platform for an experience that will best suit their shoppers. This software-as-a-service platform can be easily accessed on a variety of devices and can be used to monitor inventory, make sales, and process payments. Not having to worry about these issues lets the owner focus on the business. Shopify has grown revenue in excess of 86% year over year in every quarter since going public in mid-2015, and growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV) has exceeded 100% in six of its seven quarters. Adding to its competitive advantage is the endorsement of its product by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which shuttered its Amazon Webstore and recommended that its merchants migrate to Shopify's platform. Having the blessing of the e-commerce pioneer is no small feat. Facebook, Inc. abandoned its own plans to develop an e-commerce platform and partnered with Shopify as well. The acquisition of Shopify may seem like it would help the lumbering giant eBay in the growth department, which increased GMV by only 2% and revenue by 4% in its most recent quarter, a far cry from Shopify's growth of 100% in GMV and 86% in revenue. However, Shopify's revenue increasing from $70 million to $130 million barely registers compared to eBay's revenue growth from $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. In its most recent quarter, eBay's revenue was $2.2 billion, with GMV of $20.9 billion, which dwarfs the $130 million revenue and $5.5 billion GMV at Shopify. Even if its torrid growth were to continue, it would be some time before Shopify's results were anything more than a drop in the bucket to eBay. Image source: Shopify, Inc. If eBay were to decide that it wanted Shopify, it wouldn't come cheap -- eBay would have to pay up for that kind of growth. Shopify currently has a market cap of about $7 billion. eBay wouldn't be able to buy it for that price, however. It would be logical to assume that a 20% or even 30% premium might not be enough. Assuming a 40% premium, eBay would have to pay up to $10 billion for the still young company, and that's assuming they would even sell. Shopify might be a good fit for a company like eBay -- or even Amazon, for that matter -- but at some point a company has to consider the economics of a prospective purchase. Another consideration would be the company culture. Shopify's young snowboarder culture might not be a good fit under eBay's wing. There isn't any concrete evidence that eBay is even interested. Rumors surfaced and Shopify's stock jumped on the news, but that doesn't mean an acquisition is imminent. Investors should consider that eBay has been divesting itself of several non-core businesses lately, including both its enterprise unit and PayPal Holdings, Inc. in July 2015, shortly after Shopify went public. In a more recent move, eBay sold its position in MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), the leader in Latin American e-commerce, in October of last year. eBay acquired a 19.5% stake in its smaller rival in 2001, after trying to compete in the region for a time. MercadoLibre, which means ""free market"" in Spanish, was originally modeled after eBay, which mentored the company for years. It seems odd that eBay would divest one leading e-commerce platform, only to turn around and buy another one, though stranger things have happened. All things considered, it is unlikely that eBay would buy Shopify. Never say never, but it would likely require a much greater return on its investment. eBay could certainly swing the deal if it wanted to, but there isn't any indication it does. ","

Shares of Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W) were up 22.3% as of 12:45 p.m. EDT on Tuesday after the online home-furnishings retailer announced better-than-expected first-quarter 2017 results. Quarterly revenue increased 28.6% year over year to $960.8 million, including 32.1% growth in direct retail net revenue to $940.4 million. That translated to an adjusted net loss of $41.4 million, or $0.48 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $30.2 million, or $0.36 per share in the same year-ago period.

Mindbody Inc. (NASDAQ:MB), the company behind the online platform and mobile app by the same name that allows users to book fitness classes across various studios, saw its stock drop about 10% Friday after the market balked at the company's Q1 earnings. For the first quarter, Mindbody reported sales of $42 million, up 32% year over year. That sales growth came from a rise in subscribers, which now totals just under 60,000, as well as higher average monthly revenue per subscriber. The company still reported a loss of $0.10 per share, though that was expected due to its aggressive investment and growth strategy. As for the stock's drop on Friday, it seems that the market is just giving back some of the company's high valuation that has grown extensively in recent quarters. Image source: Mindbody, Inc. Mindbody has certainly been growing impressively in the last year, including new partnerships that have expanded its reach such as the deal announced in October that linked the Mindbody service into Under Armour's MyFitnessPal app, the more recent integration with Alphabet's Google that allows users to book easily after searching nearby studios, and the acquisition of the mobile technologies company Lymber. Mindbody co-founder and CEO Rick Stollmeyer said in the earnings release: We had a strong start to the year, with positive early returns from our high value subscriber growth strategy, the nationwide rollout of our Google integration, and the timely acquisition of Lymber. These developments reflect our focus on accelerating business and consumer engagement across our platform, fueling the growth of wellness businesses worldwide and helping millions more people live healthier, happier lives. Even after Friday's drop, shares are up around 78% over the last year. The company is still reporting net losses while it invests in continued growth, but it seems to be firing on all cylinders as it anticipates revenue growth of around 30% for full year 2017 year over year -- meaning that Friday's drop could be just a small speed bump in an otherwise impressive growth story.

Shares of Sunoco LP (NYSE:SUN) rose nearly 26% last month after the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell nearly 1,110 convenience stores to 7-Eleven. It did not include the valuable Aloha Petroleum unit in Hawaii or any APlus franchisee-operated stores, although an additional 200 convenience stores -- the remaining brand-owned stores -- are now available for sale. The transaction will inject $3.3 billion into the coffers of one of America's most identifiable brands -- immediately improving the debt-ridden balance sheet -- and allow it to focus nearly exclusively on being one of the nation's top fuel suppliers. The deal includes a 15-year take-or-pay contract to supply 7-Eleven with approximately 2.2 billion gallons of transportation fuels per year. In other words, long-term investors now have a more predictable income stream to rely on for future periods. Image source: Getty Images. The move comes after management had struggled to improve the financial profile of Sunoco LP through organic growth and smaller asset sales and received little help from its parent, Energy Transfer Partners. Consider that debt increased 82% from September 2015 to September 2016 on the heels of major acquisitions. While those transactions added slow and steady growth potential for the long haul, they also ballooned the leverage ratio to an astounding 6.75. At the end of last year, long-term debt totaled $4.5 billion. The company's previous strategic plan called for a gradual step down to ""healthier"" levels of 5.50 by March 2019, although that was still a relatively high level of debt to carry around -- and getting there wouldn't have been easy. The sale agreement with 7-Eleven puts Sunoco LP firmly on a very different path. SUN data by YCharts Sure, the retail business was achieving consistent growth -- including 27 consecutive years of same-store merchandise sales growth -- but it wasn't the silver bullet needed to rapidly deleverage the company. That realization can frame the transaction for investors that management traded high-margin retail business with painfully slow debt reduction for a significantly lower debt balance overnight and predictable cash flows from long-term fuel supply contracts. It's a big win, even if it was unexpected. The 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven provides an additional benefit for investors: preserving the Sunoco brand. It's possible that the new owner wouldn't have changed a thing given the value in the historic name, but that small detail should nonetheless continue to bolster the company's footprint, especially considering it will retain possession of the Aloha Petroleum and APlus brands, and its valuable NASCAR sponsorship. Sunoco LP made a difficult but wise move by pivoting to focus on its fuel supply business. It will preserve the strong reputation of its brand, smooth out long-term cash flows, and immediately reduce debt levels. Long story short, Sunoco LP's future became much brighter much sooner last month -- and long-term investors were immediately rewarded by the stock's jump. ","

If you want your portfolio to grow with American business, and don't want to choose individual stocks, a S&P 500 index fund could be a smart choice for you. In fact, legendary investor Warren Buffett has said several times that low-cost index fund investing is the smartest way to go for most people, and he has mentioned S&P 500 index funds as a bet on the future of U.S. growth. Fund Name Symbol Expense Ratio Total Fund Assets Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO 0.04% $310.7 Billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV 0.04% $110.6 Billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY 0.09% $170.1 Billion Data sources: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors. Data obtained on 5/8/17. These are the three major S&P 500 ETFs, and by definition, all are extremely similar in composition since they all track the same index. All three funds invest in the 500 stocks that make up the S&P 500 index, and all have done an excellent job of replicating the index's performance: Fund/Index 1-Year Total Return 3-Year Annualized Return 5-Year Annualized Return S&P 500 Index 17.17% 10.37% 13.30% Vanguard S&P 500 ETF 17.14% 10.33% 13.26% iShares Core S&P 500 ETF 17.12% 10.31% 13.24% SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust 17.00% 10.24% 13.15% Data sources: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors. Data obtained on 5/8/17, and is representative of each fund's performance as of 3/31/17. As you can see, there are negligible differences between the performance of the S&P 500 index and each of the three ETFs that track it. The S&P 500 outperformed each fund slightly, as would be expected, when accounting for each fund's expense ratio. However, just to put these differences into perspective, a $10,000 investment would have grown to $18,670 over the past five years at the S&P 500's rate of return. Even with the ""worst"" performing ETF on this list, a $10,000 investment would have grown to $18,547. The point is that with any of these three funds, you can expect your investment to deliver performance that's virtually identical to the S&P 500. I tend to gravitate to either the Vanguard or iShares option because of the slightly lower expense ratio, however if you're a fan of SPDR products, a 0.09% expense ratio isn't high by any means, and the fund is a solid ETF choice. Image source: Getty Images. I mentioned earlier that Warren Buffett has been a big supporter of low-cost index fund investing, and has specifically mentioned S&P 500 index funds. Buffett's logic is that as a group, ""active investors"" will match the market's performance over time, just like S&P index funds. The problem is that active managers come at a higher cost, and these fees can eat away at your investment returns. Buffett was referring to hedge fund managers when he made these comments, but the same logic applies to actively managed mutual funds, many of which charge expense ratios of 1% or more. As a final thought, when researching these funds, I came across a list of 15 ""S&P 500 ETFs,"" however these three were the only true examples. The rest are products known as leveraged ETFs, which use borrowed money and/or derivative securities to amplify investment returns, or to bet against the index. For example, a 2x leveraged S&P 500 ETF aims to return twice the index's performance each day. So, if the index rises by 2%, the ETF rises by 4%. If the index falls by 3%, the ETF falls by 6%. You can read more about the dangers of leveraged ETF investing at the link in the previous paragraph, but just keep in mind that these are intended to be short-term investment instruments and have an inherent downside bias over the long-term. In other words, a 2x leveraged S&P 500 ETF will not return twice the index's performance over the long run. ","

Exit Obamacare, enter Trumpcare? The U.S. House of Representatives took a major step on Thursday in making this scenario a reality. By a margin of only four votes, the House passed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which is already being referred to by many as ""Trumpcare."" Here are 10 things that the legislation will change in healthcare if ultimately enacted with all current provisions. Image source: Getty Images. Obamacare required every American to obtain health insurance, or pay a penalty. Trumpcare allows people not to purchase health insurance if they choose. However, there's a financial incentive to encourage individuals to maintain health insurance coverage: Insurers will be allowed to charge a 30% penalty on those who buy insurance after having a gap in coverage of more than 63 days. All of the Obamacare subsidies for helping some individuals pay for health insurance will go away. These subsidies will be replaced by tax credits for anyone who isn't covered by their employer, or through a government program. The tax credits will range from $2,000 to $14,000 based on age -- with families receiving higher credits than individuals. The credits will be reduced for individuals making over $75,000 annually and for families making over $150,000 annually. Obamacare imposed federally established minimum benefits that all health insurance policies had to offer. These ""essential health benefits"" included mental health and substance-abuse services, prescription drugs, preventive care, maternity care, emergency services, and lab services. Trumpcare will allow states to apply for waivers that allow them to change these minimum benefits for purposes such as reducing healthcare coverage costs and increasing the number of people with healthcare coverage. Under Obamacare, health insurers are prohibited from charging higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Trumpcare allows states to obtain waivers to allow insurers to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions. However, the higher charges would only apply to individuals with pre-existing conditions who have a gap in coverage. Trumpcare will provide $8 billion specifically for states that obtained the waiver mentioned in the previous point to provide subsidies to individuals with pre-existing conditions who don't maintain continuous coverage. The legislation also provides $130 billion that states could use for this purpose, or for expanding coverage and reducing costs in other ways. Obamacare limited insurers to charging older adults a maximum of three times the rates charged to younger adults. Trumpcare will raise the ratio limit from three to five. Image source: Getty Images. Obamacare provided funds for states to expand Medicaid. Trumpcare repeals this expansion. States will receive a set amount per beneficiary from the federal government, or if they choose, a lump-sum block grant. Trumpcare will allow states who choose to do so to require ""able-bodied"" Medicaid recipients to either work, participate in job-training programs, or help with community service. Currently, the maximum annual health savings account (HSA) contribution is $3,400 for individuals and $6,750 for families. Trumpcare increases the maximums to $6,550 for individuals and $13,100 for families beginning in 2018. Obamacare included a laundry list of taxes, such as a tax on some health insurance plans, a tax on certain prescription drugs, a tax on indoor tanning services, a medical device tax, and a capital gains, dividend, and interest income tax for higher-income Americans. Trumpcare eliminates all of these taxes. Obamacare remains the law of the land at the moment. Now that the House has passed AHCA, the legislation will go to the U.S. Senate for deliberation. If it's passed by the Senate with no changes, the bill will go to President Trump for signature. The Senate could make its own changes, though. If that happens, the bill would then go to a conference committee consisting of senators and representatives who work out the differences. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives would have to vote on the final compromise bill. If passed by both houses, it would then go to President Trump. There are still hurdles to jump, but the likelihood of Trumpcare replacing Obamacare appears much higher than it ever has. ","

Giovanni Legorano,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 4, 2017 2:30 p.m. ET By ROME -- Alphabet Inc.'s Google has agreed to pay around EUR306 million ($334 million) in back taxes in Italy, settling one of multiple legal and regulatory battles that have dogged the tech giant in Europe. The settlement ends one of several probes into Google's tax arrangements in the European Union, as governments maintain the pressure on other U.S. giants they accuse of tax evasion. The tax probes come as Brussels and national capitals crack down on what they view as corporate tax abuse, both by pushing to change international tax rules and by investigating companies that have struck deals with low-tax jurisdictions to slash their tax bill. Thursday's agreement between Google and Italy relates mainly to corporate taxes the Italians say Google failed to pay between 2009 and 2015. Rome alleges Google routed more than EUR1 billion in Italy-based revenue to its office in Ireland, where tax rates are far lower. A company spokesman said that of the EUR306 million in back taxes, EUR303 million was attributed to Google Italy, with the rest to Google Ireland. As part of the deal, Google will agree to pay taxes on future income -- largely related to advertising sales -- generated in Italy, according to Italian tax authorities. Google has long argued that clients in countries such as Italy don't actually close any advertising deals with employees in these countries, but instead buy the spots from Google Ireland, the company's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. However, a person familiar with the company's thinking said Google preferred to settle with Rome to bring to a close a controversy that has cast a negative light on the company in Italy. The Italian probe is just one of a number of judicial problems facing Google in Europe, where it has also faced scrutiny from national tax authorities in France and the U.K. The company also remains entangled in three separate antitrust investigations led by the European Commission, the bloc's top competition watchdog, which accuses Google of abusing its dominant position and favoring its own products over those of competitors. The company has denied the allegations. Governments have taken particular aim at complex corporate structures that allow companies to book revenue in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, that they have earned in high-tax countries such as Italy. Last August, the commission ordered Apple Inc. to return $13 billion to Ireland in unpaid taxes. Apple is appealing, as is Ireland, which accuses Brussels of meddling in its domestic tax affairs. Italy has been especially aggressive in pursuing tech giants. In late 2015, Apple Inc. agreed to pay about EUR318 million to end a dispute in which the company allegedly failed to pay almost EUR900 million in taxes between 2008 and 2013. Other U.S. multinationals, including Amazon.com and Facebook Inc., are also under scrutiny in Italy. Tax police have told Amazon they believe the company has evaded around EUR130 million of taxes in Italy on EUR2.5 billion in sales effected through the company's Italian website between 2011 and 2015, according to people familiar with the matter. In a statement, Amazon said it pays ""all the taxes we are required to pay in every country where we operate."" ""Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business,"" said Amazon, which has invested EUR800 million in Italy since 2010. People familiar with the situation say an Italian investigation into Facebook is also continuing. Facebook didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.

                                  ? Going to a public university could be the best route to a job in Silicon Valley. The University of California, Berkeley, had more graduates than any U.S. college score a job at one of the top 25 companies in Silicon Valley, according to a recent report from employment data firm HiringSolved. It wasn’t the only public university to make the top 10 list. In fact, only three private schools ranked that high: Stanford University (No. 2), Carnegie Mellon University (No. 3) and University of Southern California (No. 4). Here’s how the top 10 stacked up: 1. University of California, Berkeley 2. Stanford University 3. Carnegie Mellon University 4. University of Southern California 5. The University of Texas at Austin 6. Georgia Institute of Technology 7. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 8. San Jose State University 9. University of California, San Diego 10. Arizona State University Public universities also made up most of the top 20 — and Cornell University was the only Ivy League institution to crack the list, at No. 15. The way the rankings played out reflects the pipelines that lead from certain schools to the top tech companies. A 2014 infographic from “Wired,” based on data from LinkedIn, showed how Stanford graduates gravitate to jobs at Google, while many Apple

                                   employees are alums of San Jose State. This bent toward state schools — and away from elite universities — demonstrates in part that major technology companies emphasize skills over name recognition when it comes to hiring decisions. “With the wide breadth of technology available today, employers are looking for candidates who are well-versed in digital tools and can get up to speed quickly on new ones,” Rosemary Haefner, chief human resources officer at CareerBuilder, said. See also:  This is the one word you need on your resume today The study also identified the particular skills most in demand with Silicon Valley’s biggest companies. The most sought-after of these in 2017 was knowledge of Python, a programming language often used for back-end of web applications. That’s a shift from last year, when skills related to cloud services were desired above all else (now, cloud ranks third on the list.) Other computer languages that the top tech companies want recruits to have include Java, JavaScript, SQL, Matlab and HTML. For entry level jobs, other skills companies are looking for range from knowledge of C++, another programming language, to experience working with algorithms. While specific skills like these are certainly important, HiringSolved chief executive Shon Burton noted in the report that a fundamental understanding of technology basics is also key. “Often what separates, say, a good engineer from a great one is a knack for understanding the baseline ‘hows’ and ‘whys’ of how things work -- the physics of the technology,” Burton said. And while these skills are critical to scoring a job at somewhere like Microsoft

weren’t disclosed. Founded in 2011, the firm consults on all aspects of e-commerce from sales strategy and merchandise selection to dynamic pricing and promotion strategy. It uses
data-driven research and analysis to assist clients with growth strategy. The firm claims to work with more than 400 brands—including Hallmark Cards, Lifetime Brands and Reynolds
Consumer Products—helping them develop their ecommerce efforts on Amazon. Those efforts currently represent more than 2 million unique products and more than $2 billion in annual retail
sales, per WPP. Amazon reported total net sales last year of $136 billion. advertisement advertisement “The potential for brands and retailers on Amazon is enormous, but they need a holistic strategy to
succeed,” stated Shane Atchison, global CEO of POSSIBLE. “Our clients are increasingly asking us for Amazon expertise and for POSSIBLE to be that one agency to help them solve for all
things Amazon. Marketplace Ignition has built a leading consultancy with tremendous expertise and relationships with Amazon."" The company will operate under the name Marketplace Ignition, A
POSSIBLE Commerce Agency and will be led by current CEO and founder, Eric Heller. Heller stated: “Category leadership on Amazon takes dedication, operational excellence and a deep
understanding of how data drives sales and market share. Both Marketplace Ignition and POSSIBLE have data in our DNA. I’m excited for what we will do together to deliver more value to brands and
Amazon customers.”   ""Acquires""? Wokay. advertisement ",WPP's POSSIBLE Acquires Amazon Ecommerce Specialist 05/10/2017
Suzanne Vranica,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 9, 2017 7:22 a.m. ET By Possible, a digital advertising firm owned by WPP, has acquired Marketplace Ignition, a consulting firm that helps brands develop their Amazon marketing and e-commerce strategies. Based in Atlanta, Marketplace Ignition is a six-year-old consulting firm that employs about 35 staffers and works on behalf of companies such as Hallmark Cards and kitchenware maker Lifetime Brands. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Possible said it bought the firm to help it keep up with the growing demand from marketers who want help navigating Amazon and its growing advertising business. The demand from brands seeking help dealing with the e-commerce giant has exploded and goes far beyond retailers that have been most affected by the rise of Amazon, said Shane Atchison, Possible's chief executive. ""In the last 18 months, consumer packaged-goods companies have become less fearful of channel conflict and begun to get more aggressive at selling directly through Amazon,"" he said. Although Amazon's advertising business is a fraction of Google's and Facebook's, it is growing quickly. Marketers are buying ads on Amazon's sites as well as using Amazon and its data to buy ads around the web. In the past few years, Amazon has launched several search advertising products including ""Product Display Ads,"" which feature product images and text related to people's searches and direct them to Amazon product pages. EMarketer predicts that Amazon will generate $1.81 billion in world-wide ad revenue this year, while Google and Facebook pull in about $73.75 billion and $36.2 billion, respectively. In a note to investors last month, Morgan Stanley said Amazon's ad revenue could reach $5 billion by 2018. Ad executives have speculated for years that Amazon would eventually challenge the tech giants' dominance in online advertising because of the vast amounts of data it collects about consumers, including their shopping habits and purchase histories. As its ad revenues continue to grow, Madison Avenue is paying closer attention. Some executives welcome the competition. Marketers have developed a ""habit"" of spending money with Google and Facebook, said Mr. Atchison. ""It's a two-horse race and we all know you need three horses to have a marketplace. A duopoly is not good for anybody,"" he added. During WPP's earnings call in March, CEO Martin Sorrell said ""the threat to Google is clearly on search from Amazon."" But there's still a long way to go. Google is expected to have almost 78% of the $36.6 billion U.S. search ad business this year, while Amazon is expected to grab 2% of the market, eMarketer estimates. Marketplace Ignition offers clients a wide range of services, from helping brands figure out their packing and distribution for Amazon to creating the advertising that appears on the site. That includes devising the right key words needed for brands to optimize their search ads on the platform. The company recently worked with tinfoil maker Reynolds to create product pages that were optimized for search on Amazon, and it also helped the brand create ads that appear on Amazon Marketplace. Although brands and agencies have developed deep skills sets that help them manage Google search, Amazon's ad products are unique to the platform and require different approaches, said Eric Heller, CEO and founder of Marketplace Ignition. Mr. Heller said he is selling his company to Possible in the hopes that he can scale the business faster by having access to Possible and WPP's clients. Marketplace Ignition's staffers that are located in Seattle will be moved into Possible's Seattle outpost, which has a dedicated e-commerce practice that it started in 2013.

Brett Arends,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 5, 2017 4:43 p.m. ET The wily royal family has navigated ups and downs for centuries, mastering spin as a way to survive on taxpayer-funded income By LONDON (MarketWatch) — The most interesting royal news this week wasn’t what was said, but what wasn’t. Buckingham Palace announced that the queen’s husband, Prince Philip, would retire from public duties later this year. The palace denied there were any health issues, but we can draw logical inferences. The prince is 95. Queen Elizabeth II is 91. No one lasts forever. The day when Prince Charles ascends to the throne as King Charles III, while not imminent, is no longer off in the distant “future abstract” tense. And yet what is so notable is how uncontroversial this is. Had this occurred 20 years ago, there would have been serious and pointed debate about whether Charles should become king, or even whether the monarchy should continue. At its low points in the 1990s, and especially after Princess Diana’s death (20 years ago this summer), this ancient institution’s days seemed numbered. Not anymore. Charles will become king. Camilla, his once reviled former mistress, will be at his side. And the show will go on — yet again. To understand just how remarkable this is, you have to remember just how ridiculous this is. The role of head of state of the world’s fifth-richest country will once again be chosen, not by the people, or even by 300 hacks in an undemocratic “electoral college,” but by birth. And a family of frumpy Germanic mediocrity — the original family name is not “Windsor” but “Saxe-Coburg-Gotha” — will yet again talk their way into a panoply of palaces, diamonds, footmen, carriages, priceless art, untold luxuries, billions of dollars, constitutional privilege, and invitations to any party or event they care to attend. And they aren’t even called Drumpf. Last year the British royals, despite their private wealth, received $52 million tax-free from Britain’s taxpayers. At current interest rates, to get that sort of after-tax income from Her Majesty’s Treasury, anyone else would need to own about $10 billion worth of U.K. Treasury bonds, known as “gilts.” (And this doesn’t count, for example, the imputed income of living in their various palaces.) Read: Queen Elizabeth II to become Britain’s reigning champion This is, in short, quite a racket. Insiders even call it “the Firm.” Viewed as a business, the British monarchy is one of the oldest and most spectacularly successful in human history. This racket has been going more or less continuously for 1,190 years, since AD 827. Only the popes have been in business longer. If you don’t understand how astonishing that is, just let me know how Apple Inc.

How have they done it? And how have they done it, yet again? A study of the brilliant organizational strategy of the Firm over the centuries could fill a hundred Harvard case studies. No institution has proven to be more brilliantly adaptable or resourceful. And none has better mastered the dark arts of spin — while appearing not to do so at all. Some people will point to the public-relations coups of their big spectacles, such as the marriage of William and Kate, and the queen’s jubilees. Others will cite their reliance on the famous royal credo: “never complain, and never explain.” Both, as anyone knows, show weakness, and get you nothing but disrespect — as Herr Drumpf keeps learning. Still others will cite their timely production of some cute royal babies to keep the public happy. My late friend James Bullock, a distinguished British lawyer, had a brilliant alternative theory before his untimely death. The royals, he said, get away with all their wealth and privilege so long as they avoid flaunting it. Yes, they ride in carriages on big occasions. But the rest of the time they take care to act low-key. They marry plain people. They wear frumpy clothes. They have boring hobbies like gardening and walking the corgies. They never look too happy in public. And they vacation in cold, damp places like Scotland and Wales — when even blue-collar Brits jet off to the Mediterranean. Bullock argued that the royals got in trouble back in the 1980s and 1990s because too many of them started living glamorous lives. That’s when the public started resenting that they got the palaces and privileges as well. He’s not wrong. And it’s notable how boring, frumpy Charles has doggedly worked his way back into public favor with plain, unglamorous Camilla by his side — while resentment of pushy, lazy and glamorous Kate Middleton, aka “the Duchess of Do Little,” is on the rise.

Sue Chang,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 10, 2017 5:48 p.m. ET Defensive stocks outperform during May to October By May traditionally marks the beginning of the six months when the stock market’s returns lag the November-April period, coining the adage “sell in May and go away.” But with all such axioms, there are always exceptions and the health care sector appears to be one. Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, pored over the data for various assets during a 27-year span and found that some sectors thrive, even when the broader market is struggling. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index

                                   1.53% rise. The consumer staples sector was another overachiever, returning an average 4.45%. “Although not the best sector by average percentage, consumer staples advancing 81.5% of the time is the closest thing to a sure bet for gains during the ‘Worst Months,’” he wrote on his blog. At the bottom were materials, which fell 2.31%. Transportation and industrials also posted dismal returns. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, made a similar observation last month, recommending investors to rotate into “defensive” stocks rather than exit the market completely. Defensive plays refer to investing in companies that manufacture or provide services that are viewed as essential regardless of the economic cycle, such as consumer staples—food, beverages, tobacco, medicine—and utilities. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch likewise urged investors to refrain from selling out. Instead, they trimmed their exposure to stocks, even though they remained overweight in equities, and raised their allocation for cash, given the nearly 8% surge in the S&P 500 and expectations for additional interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, argued that the “sell in May” rule is a good example of how NOT to invest. “The benefits are speculative and uncertain. What is certain are the costs, in transaction fees and potentially taxes. Over time, it simply doesn’t make sense. You’re better off spending your time and energy trying to understand what’s actually going on,” he said in a recent note. To underscore how spurious and irrational such relationships are, Macmillan points out that statistics with the highest correlation with U.S. stock market returns are the cheese production rate in the U.S. and the combined sheep population of Bangladesh and the U.S. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

This list, of course, might also be viewed as an indicator of where narcissists are traveling. According to a survey of 3,700 college students by LendEdu, 64% of millennials say Instagram is the most narcissistic social-media platform. “With just a few filters, a little saturation, and a clever caption, social media can make even the most average Joe look like an esteemed socialite,” the LendEdu study noted. “They use these platforms to boast of their daily tidings, carefully craft their public image, and feed their egos in this interconnected digital age.” The list ranges from the historic, including, in Paris, the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame, to the adventurous, with national parks and lush beaches.

Tomi Kilgore,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 9, 2017 7:33 a.m. ET Apple’s market cap briefly topped $800 billion after Berkshire Hathaway discloses its stake ballooned to $19.2 billion By Apple Inc.’s market value briefly topped $800 billion for the first time Monday, as the stock surged further into uncharted territory after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed it boosted its stake in the technology giant to nearly $20 billion in recent months. The billionaire investor’s investment vehicle disclosed in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Apple was its second-biggest equity holding by value, after increasing its investment to $19.2 billion worth of the stock as of March 31 from $7.1 billion as of Dec. 31. Based on the March 31 closing price of Apple’s stock

That would push Berkshire up to fourth on the list of largest shareholders, according to FactSet data. The stock ran up as much as 3.2% to an all-time intraday high of $153.70 in afternoon trade. At that price, and with 5.21 billion shares outstanding as of March 31 according to filings, Apple’s market capitalization reached $801.37 billion. Apple shares pared some gains to close up 2.7% at $153.00, to bring the market cap down to $797.72 billion, but that was still by far the highest among U.S. companies.

Cullen Roche,05112017,MarketWatch,05042017,"Published: May 9, 2017 12:53 p.m. ET Why? They’re often wrong By Come into my office, ladies and gentlemen. We need to discuss a growing problem in the investment world: guru worship and putting expert predictions in perspective. Investing is hard. Really hard. The overwhelming majority of professionals, and amateurs, are bad at it. That’s why indexing is growing so fast. So it’s only natural to hang your hat on the expertise of gurus. This makes sense. There’s nothing wrong with relying on experts for opinions. The problem is, experts often make short-term predictions about things that aren’t that predictable. (I do this sometimes. But the reason I like macro is largely because long-term predictions have a higher probability of turning out true.) And the media will intentionally stretch that view further because those are often the views that generate the most attention. As a result, guru worship is like a drug that is unregulated and happily consumed. For instance, all sorts of interesting investing tips were being thrown around at the Sohn Investment Conference on May 8. One particular idea came from Jeff Gundlach, who said a leveraged bet shorting U.S. stocks was a good idea (with a long position in emerging markets). That sounds crazy bearish, right? Well, I took to Twitter

                                   to note that the media have reported a consistent bearishness from Gundlach for many years. There’s a bunch of potential pitfalls here. First of all, this should not be remotely surprising. Gundlach, who heads DoubleLine Capital LP, is talking his book to some degree. He’s a bond manager who doesn’t have much to gain by saying stocks are great and bonds are bad. Read: The 10 biggest myths in the investing world Second, I am almost certain that Gundlach hasn’t actually been this bearish on U.S. stocks all this time. In fact, I am willing to bet that most of his public statements about various assets don’t accurately reflect his portfolio or convictions. But we don’t actually know for a fact one way or the other because there’s no public assets that reflect these views completely. The only things we really know about Gundlach’s investing positions are the ones he holds with conviction in his actual bond fund. And that bond fund has been a terrific performer. So while these headlines will garner huge traffic, they don’t actually tell us anything all that useful about how we should allocate our assets. But most importantly, these are short-term predictions. And we know, for a fact, that experts aren’t very good at predicting the short term. And while we’re inclined to lean on experts for opinions, we need to be careful about letting short-termism bias us into believing that experts are any better about predicting the short-term than anyone else. So be careful out there reading headlines and thinking that you’re getting the whole story. Odds are you’re getting only half the story and letting short-term biases cloud your judgement.

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - Mobile phone apps took center stage at Google’s annual developer conference on Wednesday as the search giant announced new features for its digital assistant and its popular photo app while devoting little time to the Android mobile operating system. Addressing an audience of thousands of developers in Mountain View, California, Google executives delivered a broad-based update to their product portfolio which also included a slate of new features for the Google Home speaker, a job search tool and even a set of new virtual reality headsets. What’s more, the assistant will soon be able to complete transactions and supply information about objects captured by the smartphone’s camera, executives said. But several analysts noted that the emphasis on the assistant and other apps like photos and maps, which run on many types of devices, resulted in the company’s Android operating system — long the cornerstone of Google’s mobile strategy — getting relatively little attention during the presentation. That reflects a recognition by the search giant that the assistant and other apps will be increasingly important to its future, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. The strategy helps the company sidestep some of the complications of developing new features for the vast Android ecosystem, where only a fraction of devices are running on the latest version of the operating system, he noted. “This is partly a concession to the fact that whatever they put into Android, most users don’t see it for a couple years ... and a lot of their best, most attractive, most valuable users are going to be on other platforms,” Dawson said. “They need to put that functionality where users are.” The Google Assistant debuted last year on the company’s own hardware, and Google has gradually extended the tool to devices from other manufacturers running on its Android operating system. “Humans are interacting with computing in more natural and immersive ways,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the audience. “We’ve been using voice as an input across many of our products. We’ve had significant breakthroughs.” The company is also gaining traction with its photo app, which now reaches 500 million users regularly, Pichai said. To drive greater usage of the app, Google will now make suggestions to prod users to share images and allow them to order physical photo albums. Pichai also announced the company will expand its search engine with a new jobs tab that will allow candidates to filter postings by criteria such as wages and commute time. Google, which gets most of its revenue from its dominant search engine, also released a host of new features for Google Home, a speaker released last year. Users will soon be able to make phone calls using the device, and the HBO Now streaming service, owned by Time Warner Inc TWX.N, will be integrated as well. While Amazon’s Echo speaker has emerged as the most popular device in the category, Google repeatedly touted its ability to use artificial intelligence to identify multiple users, an edge it has over Amazon. “Google was putting forward a message about artificial intelligence and how they are including the technology in virtually every aspect of their products and services,” said analyst Brian Blau of Gartner. “They really pushed that message hard.” ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The “right to be forgotten” - or stopping certain web search results from appearing under searches for people’s names - will be debated at the European Union’s top court after Alphabet Inc’s Google refused requests from four individuals. In May 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) ruled that people could ask search engines, such as Google and Microsoft’s Bing, to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results appearing under searches for people’s names - dubbed the “right to be forgotten”. Google has since received over 720,000 removal requests and accepted about 43 percent of them, according to its transparency report. Four individuals who had asked Google to remove links to webpages about them appealed to the French data protection authority after the search engine company refused their request. The French privacy regulator, the CNIL, agreed with Google’s decision, prompting the individuals to take their case to the French Conseil d’Etat, France’s supreme administrative court, which referred it to the Luxembourg-based ECJ. The ECJ “now has to decide whether ‘sensitive personal data’ — such as the political allegiance of an individual, or a past criminal conviction reported in the press — should always outweigh the public interest”, Google’s senior privacy counsel Peter Fleischer wrote in a blogpost. “Requiring automatic delisting from search engines, without any public interest balancing test, risks creating a dangerous loophole. Such a loophole would enable anyone to demand removal of links that should remain up in the public interest, simply by claiming they contain some element of sensitive personal data.” A Conseil de’Etat statement said the requests from the individuals concerned a video that “explicitly revealed the nature of the relationship that an applicant was deemed to have entertained with a person holding a public office”; a press article on the suicide of a member of the Church of Scientology mentioning that one of the applicants was the public relations manager of that church; several articles related to criminal proceedings of an applicant; and articles about the conviction of another applicant for having sexually abused minors. The French court said a number of “serious issues” had arisen with regard to the interpretation of European law in the case before it. “Such issues are in relation with the obligations applying to the operator of a search engine with regard to web pages that contain sensitive data, when collecting and processing such information is illegal or very narrowly framed by legislation, on the grounds of its content relating to sexual orientations, political, religious or philosophical opinions, criminal offences, convictions or safety measures,” the court said. The CNIl declined comment at this point of the court procedure. The case number is C-136/17. A date for the hearing has not been set. “We will be advocating strongly for the public interest balancing test to apply to all types of delisting requests—including those containing sensitive personal data,” Fleischer said.

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"Berlin (Reuters) - Die deutschen Zeitungsverleger sind nach eigener Einschätzung stark auf den US-Technologieriesen Google angewiesen. Es sei mehr als nur wichtig, dass der Suchmaschinenanbieter Nutzer auf die Internetseiten der Pressehäuser leite und damit indirekt für Werbeeinnahmen sorge, signalisierte der Präsident des Branchenverbands BDZV, Mathias Döpfner, am Mittwoch auf einer Konferenz in Berlin. “Wir profitieren nicht von dem Traffic, den Google uns verschafft - wir sind komplett davon abhängig.” Das Leistungsschutzrecht rund um die Veröffentlichung von Pressetexten im Netz habe der US-Konzern mit seiner Marktmacht faktisch ausgehebelt. Döpfner ist auch Chef des “Bild”-Herausgebers Axel Springer. Die Verlage suchten nach funktionierenden digitalen Geschäftsmodellen, sagte der BDZV-Chef. Er bezeichnete sein Verhältnis zu globalen Playern wie Google und Facebook als “gespalten”. Beide Konzerne sorgten für erhebliche Chancen beim Bemühen um hohe Nutzerzahlen und eine große Reichweite. Zugleich dürfe man nicht verkennen, dass diese Plattformen “einen ganz konkreten Zweck verfolgen, nämlich unsere Reichweite zu monetarisieren, ohne dass sie einen einzigen Inhalt selbst geschaffen haben”. Der Konflikt zwischen Google und den Verlagen dreht sich um das Leistungsschutzrecht. Auf der einen Seite stehen mehrere Medienunternehmen wie Springer, die für die Verwertung ihrer Pressetexte im Internet Geld haben wollen. Suchmaschinen wie Marktführer Google wollen aber nicht zahlen. Sie argumentieren, dass sie Nutzer auf die Webseiten der Verlage leiten und diesen damit zu Werbeeinnahmen verhelfen. Der langjährige Rechtsstreit beschäftigt künftig auch den europäischen Gerichtshof EuGH. Im vorigen Jahr hatte das Landgericht Berlin eine Kartellklage abgewiesen und erklärt, Google habe zwar mit gut 90 Prozent in Deutschland eine marktbeherrschende Stellung als Suchmaschine. Ein Missbrauch der Marktmacht liege aber nicht vor. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"(Reuters) - Deep Nishar spends more time roaming university hallways than he does corporate boardrooms. With pitfalls aplenty among the valuation-rich, profit-poor start-ups of Silicon Valley, Son is seeking to hire dealmakers who can spot the most commercially disruptive technologies, according to people close to him. Son is looking for industry wonks to complement those hires and find potentially game-changing investments in areas ranging from genomics and artificial intelligence to robots and the internet-of-things. The sources asked not to be identified ahead of the conclusion of the fundraising. Nishar, 47, is the most senior industry expert working for SoftBank, which he joined in 2015. He sits on SoftBank’s investment committee, which includes Son, SoftBank chief financial officer Alok Sama, SoftBank board director Ronald Fisher, and head of the Vision Fund, Rajeev Misra. SoftBank has yet to finalize the investment committee for the Vision Fund, which it will manage. Even when he was working at LinkedIn and Google, Nishar had an interest in investing. The Indian-born engineer spent five years tracking the business of pre-cancer detection startup Guardant Health. He visited researchers in universities and even showed up in doctors’ offices to see which tests they prescribed to detect cancer. When Guardant sought to raise money in 2016, Nishar had an inside track. He arranged a meeting between Guardant’s founders and Son at SoftBank’s San Carlos office near San Francisco. Last week, SoftBank said it would lead a $360 million fundraising round for Guardant, with Son praising it as a potential “Rosetta Stone” of cancer. Guardant co-founder and CEO Helmy Eltoukhy said Nishar’s business experience and technical expertise made him stand out from other investment professionals. “This kind of experience, from the engineering side as well as business side, is hard to come by,” he said. Nishar has four people on his team, which focuses on so-called frontier technologies, such as computational biology. He is looking to double that by the end of the year, according to people familiar with the plans.     SoftBank also wants experts in other sectors, including enterprise software, artificial intelligence, robotics, digital media and financial technology, according to the sources.     Other sector specialists working for SoftBank include David Thevenon, a former Google executive who handles ride-sharing investments for SoftBank, such as Didi in China, Ola in India, and Grab in Southeast Asia, and Kabir Misra, an e-commerce specialist who is helping put together the merger of Flipkart and Snapdeal in India. Son is building his team as technology investing has become increasingly competitive. Google and other technology companies are looking to invest in the areas SoftBank is focusing on, as are private equity and venture capital funds. The dealmaking team SoftBank is building will also be pivotal for 59-year-old Son’s own legacy and eventual transition, after Nikesh Arora, a former Google executive he had named as his successor, resigned last year. A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Son does not subscribe to the traditional Japanese business culture of pecking order and hierarchy, leaving plenty of scope for people in this team to pitch investment ideas to him.        “Son is not terribly hierarchical. If you know something more than him on a particular topic, you will get air time, he will listen to you,” said Raine Group LLC co-founder Jeff Sine, Son’s most trusted investment banking adviser, who has participated in most of his deals. Son is the only individual listed as “key man” for the Vision Fund, meaning that, no matter how many dealmakers he hires, he is responsible for all the investment decisions, and the fund could be dissolved in his absence. Many of the hirings happen through personal connections; Nishar, for example, was recruited by Arora, based on their ties going back to Google. ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - In a cluster of refurbished Mao-era industrial buildings in Guangzhou, developers at China’s top messaging app, WeChat, are redesigning key parts of its product to spread its tentacles to just about every aspect of Chinese life. Around 1,500 developers, mainly twentysomething males, have been tasked with increasing user engagement through new ‘mini-programs’ on WeChat that look and operate much like apps on Apple Inc’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems - but are far less data-intensive. WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, says it’s not a direct challenge to the dominant mobile platforms, but some analysts and developers say the new business could eat into that of iOS and Android app ecosystems. (For a graphic on priority messaging click tmsnrt.rs/2pYVMKR) “In the long-term, the relationship between Tencent and Apple’s ecosystems will be co-existence and ‘co-opetition’ - intense competition in some areas and time periods, coupled with some form of cooperation in others,” said Su Ning, professor of Information Systems at Ivey Business School in Canada. With more than 938 million users, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. Half the users spend more than 90 minutes a day on its chat app, according to WeChat. WeChat’s push on these nimble mini-apps comes as Google this week launched its own Android Instant Apps, which don’t require downloading and are available on certain Android devices, though access to Google products in China is heavily restricted. WeChat says there are about 200,000 third-party developers for the WeChat platform. “A very strong trend in China is that demand for iOS and Android apps is waning, while that for programme developing based on WeChat is rising,” said Leon Du, co-founder of Guangzhou-based Beansmile, a digital consultancy that develops apps and websites. Helped by WeChat-based advertising and payment-related services, Tencent this week reported its highest profit growth in three years for the first quarter. While Tencent doesn’t release data on the number of mini-programs available, Dong Xu, a manager at market data firm Analysys, says her interviews with businesses suggest the adoption rate has so far been modest. “Mini-programs are mainly used for low-frequency, offline scenarios, such as fee payments, parking, and customer inquiries,” Dong said. “Users’ in-depth needs such as entertainment and e-commerce still take place with apps.” Third-party developers say the mini-programs, built in WeChat’s proprietary programming language, are less data-heavy and easier to develop than their iOS or Android counterparts. Users, for example, can tap a programme on a restaurant’s official WeChat account to order food, have it delivered to their table and pay for it, all in one app. WeChat also last month quietly established a new department dedicated to online searching, and this week rolled out a beta search-engine box with enhanced power, revealing its ambition to take on rival Baidu Inc. Central to its plans for an expansive and dynamic app ecosystem is the development of WeChat’s own payment infrastructure. Around 300 developers work for WeChat Pay, which competes with Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and to a lesser extent, Apple Pay, which launched in China last year. TenPay, which runs WeChat Pay and Tencent’s smaller QQ Wallet, is China’s most popular mobile payment provider by users, with 838 million users dwarfing Alipay’s 432 million, according to Analysys. At a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday, Tencent President Martin Lau flagged WeChat Pay’s goal to permeate all aspects of consumer life in China. For Apple, which wants to deepen its reach in China, the world’s biggest mobile spender, WeChat’s large and loyal fan base and its payment service present a challenge. China overtook the United States as the biggest contributor to Apple’s iOS app store revenue last year, according to mobile data analytics firm App Annie. However, Apple’s Greater China revenue dropped 14 percent in the first three months of the year, as cheaper rivals chipped away at sales. Apple declined to comment for this article. Last month, some Chinese WeChat fans threatened to ditch Apple products after the U.S. firm forced the chat app to abolish a popular tipping function. While building user loyalty is a core part of both Apple’s and WeChat’s strategies, Zhang Ying, general manager of WeChat Pay, has downplayed product tensions from the tipping spat. “Apple is still supportive of the [WeChat] ecosystem. We are part of the [Apple] ecosystem,” he told a forum in Hong Kong last month. “It is far from a ‘choose-one-or-another’ - it’s merely some disagreement.” ","

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"The rulings are a setback for Uber as it tries to gain an advantage in litigation with serious strategic and financial consequences in the nascent field of autonomous technology. The ride services company failed to remove the ongoing case from public view and now faces the prospect of getting caught up in a fresh criminal probe. The acrimonious trade secrets battle could determine the future of Uber’s self-driving car operations and the strength of Waymo’s toehold in the sector. Alsup filed his injunction opinion temporarily under seal, so its scope and details could not immediately be learned. The case hinges on over 14,000 confidential files that Waymo, formerly Google’s self-driving car program, alleges were stolen by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski before he left the company. Levandowski, who is not a defendant in the civil case, subsequently co-founded self-driving truck start-up Otto that was acquired months later by Uber. Waymo claims the stolen information made its way into Uber’s Lidar system, a sensor that uses light pulses to “see” the environment. It alleges the documents allowed Uber to fast-track its own technology and avoid years of costly research. In referring the case to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation of possible trade secret theft, Alsup said he took “no position” on whether a criminal prosecution was warranted. In his arbitration ruling, however, the judge noted the record contained “ample evidence” that Levandowski breached his duty of loyalty to Waymo. Uber declined to comment on Alsup’s request for a separate criminal investigation into the theft allegations. In a statement the company said “we remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology.” Uber has not denied that Levandowski took Waymo’s documents, but says they never made their way to Uber, nor into its own designs. Representatives for the Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment, nor could attorneys for Levandowski. The engineer has not commented publicly on the allegations. Reuters reported last week that the Justice Department had begun a separate criminal investigation into Uber’s use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators. In a statement, Waymo said Uber’s bid to have the civil case heard in private by an arbitrator, not a jury, was a “desperate” attempt to avoid the court’s jurisdiction. Unlike court proceedings, which are largely conducted in public, arbitrations take place behind closed doors. Because Levandowski was not a defendant in the case, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the trade secret claims into a private forum, Alsup wrote. The Alphabet unit asked Alsup to issue an injunction preventing Uber from using Waymo’s trade secrets, and Levandowski from working on Lidar. Complicating Uber’s task is the fact that Levandowski has invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination and has refused to testify. Alsup wrote that Levandowski’s position “has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants’ ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files.” Uber had already announced that Levandowski would step aside from working on Lidar while the case was being litigated, and said the company would agree to a court injunction that formalized that arrangement. However, Waymo sought a broader injunction that would prevent Uber from using a series of its trade secrets. ","

Spahn's workbench in this 240,000-square foot plant is one small example of a multibillion-dollar bet by GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt: digital technology will transform GE's factories, generate new revenue and boost profits. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pDvYUA The $4 billion GE has spent on developing digital products – ranging from tiny sensors in jet engines to augmented reality and software that can crunch large volumes of data - is on the scale of investments Google and Facebook Inc FB.N made to build their businesses, Bill Ruh, CEO of GE’s digital division, told Reuters. Now that GE has shed non-essential operations, including most of its large financial unit, its fortunes will rise or fall depending on whether that investment delivers. By 2020, spending on such systems is expected to exceed $500 billion a year, up from $20 billion in 2012, according to an estimate cited by consulting firm Accenture. GE says the market for the sectors it is in will be $225 billion by 2020. The company has spent $5 billion setting up new U.S. factories in the last five years. As it now adds digital technology to its plants, it needs fewer, and higher skilled, workers than in the past. “We’re going to have a smarter worker,” Immelt said in an interview. “We’re not going to have as many workers.” But as investment grows, so have concerns about whether these bets will pay off - and about the cost and complexity of keeping networked machines running and secure from hackers. GE investors are especially impatient for returns. Since Immelt became CEO in 2001, GE shares have fallen 29 percent while the S&P 500 index has more than doubled. GE’s dividend is seven cents lower than it was in 2008. For more on GE’s stock performance, click [L1N1IB0OI] That performance has some pressing for more urgency from Immelt. When activist investor Nelson Peltz bought a $2.5 billion GE stake in 2015, he pressed for asset sales and cost cutting, and barely mentioned GE’s digital strategy as a source of growth. Trian declined to comment for this article. In March, Peltz reached an agreement with GE that tied the bonuses of top executives to cutting $2 billion in costs and hitting profit targets through 2017. Those targets don’t rely on GE’s digital strategy. “People aren’t saying they don’t like the technology” or that GE is investing too much in digital, said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “But how does it translate into profit margins and cash?” GE poses an important test of the digital factory idea. It has more than 500 factories around the globe that produce jet engines, power plants, medical CT scanners and other large, sophisticated equipment adaptable to the technology. Take the industrial operating system called Predix. GE spent more than $1 billion to create it along with applications that can analyze terabytes of data from jet engines or factory machines along with other data, such as weather or energy costs. GE’s venture capital arm is buying stakes in startups that adapt robots, optical scanners and augmented reality to work with Predix. Last year, GE spent $1.1 billion on two makers of industrial 3-D printers, planning both to use the printers and sell them. Predix systems work, in part, by creating a computerized model, or “digital twin,” of a machine that shows in real time how it is performing, and when parts are wearing out. This can eliminate unplanned breakdowns, GE says, saving time and money. The system also creates a ""digital thread"" that logs, like a medical record, every aspect of a machine’s life - from initial assembly to repairs during its years of operation. At GE’s Grove City factory, digital systems that were installed in the last 18 months time workers down to the second. Flat screens over work bays count how long crews are spending and turn red when jobs are taking too long. “I can look at that screen and see everything I need to know about how things are running,” said Richard Simpson, vice president of supply chain at GE Transportation, pointing to a display. Even though it is still a grimy, greasy industrial shop, Grove City is one of 17 “showcases” GE plans to have by year-end, helping it sell its systems to outside customers. When a massive railroad engine rolls in for repair, workers check the digital twin to see what parts need to be fixed. The system ensures spares are in stock. Older engines are fitted with sensors so they can supply that data next time. The process saves labor by eliminating unnecessary work. “Instead of full tear downs, the factory workers can refurbish just the parts that need it,” said Anup Sharma, a general manager at GE Digital. “That frees them up to do value added work and gets the engine back to the customer sooner.” GE executives say the company has reaped $1 billion in productivity gains during the last two years, with $700 million more expected in 2017. Those gains are being reinvested into Predix and applications, so they have not had a large effect on GE’s earnings, the executives said. The gains are not broken out for investors to see. “I’m not completely all in on GE,” Smith said. “There’s very little revenue from digital so far.” GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview that the digital division “will become real for investors” when it begins to boost revenue and profits, starting in 2019 or 2020. GE has no choice but to invest in the strategy, he added. “If we don’t do this then somebody else is going to,” Bornstein said. “That is not a good thing.” ","

In a blog post published on Monday, Google said it updated the technology behind AdSense so that ads can be pulled from individual web pages instead of a publisher's entire website. It is also gearing up to roll out a new platform dubbed “Policy Center” that will help website publishers better understand Google’s policies and rules governing AdSense. The company said one of publishers' top requests is for more transparency in how it responds to violations. (See also: Warren Buffett's Biggest Mistake: Google) “Policies play an important role in protecting the open web. They ensure publishers have a sustainable way to make money through our ads platforms, setting rules about what we do and don’t allow,” wrote Scott Spencer, director of sustainable ads in the blog post. “For example, publishers can’t just have a site full of ads. Our policies exist to balance publishers’ needs with those of our users, advertisers and all of the parties that depend on it to keep the open web going.” Spencer said as Google rolls out its new page-level policy violation feature it will be able to stop showing ads on select pages while leaving them on the rest of the site where “good” content is. Google said it will still terminate publishers that repeatedly violate polices but that the new tool means less disruptions for publishers. (See also: Google Moves to Clean Up Fake News In Search) On the transparency front, Google said its upcoming Policy Center will serve as a “one-stop shop for everything a publisher needs to know about policy actions that affect their sites and pages.” Spencer said the company has been testing Policy Center with thousands of AdSense publishers. “In just a few weeks, all AdSense publishers will have more transparency about why policy actions were taken and the violations found, including page-level action data, so they can quickly resolve these issues across all their sites and pages using step-by-step instructions. The Policy Center also makes it easy for publishers to tell us when policy issues have been resolved and their pages are ready for review,” wrote Spencer. Faced with backlash over ads showing up next to offensive content Google has been changing the way advertisements are displayed on YouTube, which has resulted in many YouTube creators seeing a big decline in their advertising revenue, reported TechCrunch. YouTube creators have asked Google for more transparency, arguing the new controls hurt videos that follow all the policies, noted the report.

(GOOG​) subsidiary Google announced the acquisition of virtual reality (VR) game studio Owlchemy last week. At first glance, the acquisition might seem like an astute move, especially given the popularity of Owlchemy's games. But there is a catch. Owlchemy develops games that use hand motion, while Google's only VR product – the Daydream headset – utilizes a remote and has limited motion range. (See also: What is Google Daydream?) Why, then, did the Mountain View, California-based company acquire Owlchemy? There could be a couple of reasons. (See also: Google Just Acquired an Award-Winning VR Studio.) First, Google could be broadening its VR offering portfolio. In an interview with The Verge, Relja Markovic, engineering director for Google VR and augmented reality (AR), said that Google had a ""pretty big vision"" for VR and AR. That vision is not restricted to headsets alone. The company has already released VR apps, such as Tilt Brush, which are popular across multiple VR platforms from HTC Vive to Oculus Rift owned by Facebook, Inc. (FB). In turn, this could help Google earn revenue from several platforms as VR becomes mainstream. (See also: HBO, Netflix Get VR Upgrades.) Second, the popularity of Owlchemy's games could make a serious contribution to Google's bottom line. In a blog post, Alex Schwartz, Owlchemy's co-founder, assured readers that the company would continue to focus on hand interactions and high-quality user experiences. This suggests that the studio has more funds at its disposal (thanks to Google's acquisition) and the same degree of creative freedom it had earlier. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT​) tried the same strategy earlier with its acquisition of Minecraft maker Mojang in 2014. Much like Google, Microsoft promised creative freedom to Mojang when it was acquired. Per a release last year, Minecraft sold 53,000 editions per day in 2016. The game is also a substantial contributor to revenue from Microsoft's gaming division. (See also: Microsoft to Launch Minecraft Marketplace.) ","Why Did Google Acquire Owlchemy?

Dan Loeb’s Third Point, which had reduced its stake last quarter, boosted it this past quarter by purchasing 30,000 additional shares for a total of 455,000 shares in the company. However, those moves contrast with the ones made by Ken Griffin’s Citadel Advisor and California State Teachers Retirement System (CALSTRS). Citadel reduced its stake in the company by approximately 24% to 2,491,935. That reduction is spread across various classes of stock issued by the company. CALSTRS’ investment in Alphabet also slid by 4.3% across various stock classes. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google and Facebook Inc.

In a blog post, Facebook, whose revenues have been significantly boosted by its dominant position in digital advertising markets, claimed that this latest issue only occurred on its mobile platform and affected video carousel ads (see example below). When smartphone users clicked on these marketing videos, even if to just expand them, website clicks were inadvertently registered.

 ,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"David Burke says the next wave of Android smartphones will tackle one of the agonies of modern existence: Copying text from one app and pasting into another. Burke is the Google vice president of engineering who oversees Android. This week, at the annual Google I/O conference in Silicon Valley, he unveiled Android O, the latest incarnation of the world's most popular mobile operating system, and part of his pitch was that was that new OS could remove the extreme pain from cut and paste. Android O will automatically recognize and highlight names, places, and addresses in email messages and other text, he said, so you can copy and paste them without struggling to drag those horribly small and ridiculously uncooperative little arrow thingies from word to word. As seen on the big screen behind him, Burke double-tapped on the words ""Old Coffee House"" in an email, and Android highlighted all three of those words—no more and no less. Google Rattles the Tech World With a New AI Chip for All Sundar Pichai Sees Google’s Future in the Smartest Cloud The Race To Build An AI Chip For Everything Just Got Real Google Lens Turns Your Camera Into a Search Box That feat drew a very real round of applause from the hundreds of coders and other tech heads gathered at the Shoreline Amphitheater. But it was merely the teaser for so many other things to come. The new copy-and-paste tool is driven by a deep neural network that runs right there on the phone—an AI service trained to recognize things like names and addresses. And that's not an easy thing to pull off. Typically, these kinds of AI algorithms, including those that identify objects in photos or recognize commands spoken into smartphone digital assistants, must run in some massive data center on the other side of the internet—meaning you can't use them unless you have a wireless signal. But now, Google is building a software engine for smartphones suited to running AI without help from some distant data center. This is called TensorFlow Lite, a streamlined version of the open source software engine that drives neural networks inside Google's data centers. According to Burke, it's designed to be ""fast and small while still enabling state-of-the-art techniques""—namely, the new wave of neural networks that are so rapidly changing the way companies are building and operating online services. Google won't say much more about this new project. But it has revealed that TensorFlow Lite will be part of the primary TensorFlow open source project later this year, meaning it will soon be available to the worldwide community coders. The idea is that so many other, outside Google, will build neural networks that run there on the phone, driving tasks well beyond image recognition, speech recognition, and cut and paste. Google isn't the only one working to push neural networks beyond the data center. Facebook is already using neural networks to add Snapchat-like filters to photos without calling out over the internet, and the company has released an open source software engine that's similar to TensorFlow Lite. The difference is that Google controls an enormously popular smartphone operating system. It can distribute this kind of mobile tech much more quickly—and to a far larger audience. Even with these software engines, running neural networks on a phone is a questionable undertaking. They can sap processing power and battery life. But both Facebook and Google are encouraging chip makers to build processors specifically suited for this kind of arithmetic. In unveiling TensorFlow Lite, Burke also said that he and his team are also building hooks into the Android's code that can tie into such chips. That effort will take even more doing. But Google has clearly committed to this vision of AI on the phone. At I/O, the company also unveiled a custom-built chip for both training and running neural networks in its data centers. I asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai if the company might build its own mobile chip along the same lines. He said the company had no plans to do so, but he didn't rule it out either.

Jordan Novet,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Google has spent a decade building servers that can handle billions of web searches a day. The company is now developing chips to deliver the smartest results. At its annual developer conference on Wednesday, Alphabet introduced the second generation of Google's tensor processing unit (TPU), which is designed for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Google unveiled the first version in 2016 and said it had started work on the ""stealthy project"" a few years earlier. The upgraded version is the latest indication that Google doesn't want to depend on other companies for core computing infrastructure. It's potentially troubling news for Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) have been used by Google for intensive machine learning applications. Nvidia even named Google Cloud as a notable customer in its latest annual report. Deep learning, a trendy type of AI, typically involves two stages: training artificial neural networks on lots of data, and then directing the networks to make inferences about the new data. Over the past five years, GPUs have become a standard for the training stage of deep learning, which can be used for image recognition, speech recognition and other applications. While the original TPU was only meant for the inference stage of deep learning, the new version can handle training as well. ""I would expect us to use these TPUs more and more for our training needs, making our experiment cycle faster and more rapid,"" said Jeff Dean, a senior fellow and head of the Google Brain research team, in a media briefing on Tuesday. The company is sill using ""GPUs internally for some kinds of models,"" he said. It takes a day to train a machine translation system using 32 of the best commercially available GPUs, and the same workload takes six hours atop eight connected TPUs, Dean said. Unlike Nvidia and Intel, Google operates this equipment inside its own data centers rather than selling it to other device makers. Facebook has done much the same, although it has opted to share the designs publicly through the Open Compute Project it established in 2011. People outside Google will be able to rent out virtual machines (VMs) with acceleration from the second-generation TPUs. Google will also introduce VMs that draw on the Volta GPU that Nvidia announced earlier this month. Over time, Nvidia could find itself getting less business for AI directly from Google. There could also be a more indirect impact, as some users of Nvidia GPUs for AI processing might run that work in Google's data centers. Nvidia has been a Wall Street darling of late. The stock price has surged nine-fold over the past four years and the company is now worth more than $80 billion. In addition to data center customers, Nvidia also sells GPUs for professional workstations, gaming rigs and even vehicles. Last month, Google published a paper comparing TPUs to existing chips and said its own processors are running 15 to 30 times faster and 30 to 80 times more efficient than the competition. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang shot back and said his company's current chips have ""approximately twice the performance of the TPU — the first-generation TPU."" A spokesperson for Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday's announcement. ",Google introduced the second version of its TPU for AI

Uber will be able to continue working on its self-driving car technology, the judge said, but embattled engineer Anthony Levandowski must be removed from any work relating to a key technology called LIDAR, which helps cars ""see."" Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, has sued Uber, claiming that the ride-hailing start-up is using key parts of Waymo's self-driving technology. The fight centers around Levandowski, who was deeply involved in Google's self-driving car initiative before leaving to found a start-up, Otto, which Uber later acquired. Waymo's lawyers have asserted that Levandowski stole documents from Alphabet, and that Levandowski was already negotiating with Uber before he left Alphabet. ""The evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo's confidential files,"" U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francsico wrote. ""Waymo has also sufficiently shown ... that the 14,000-plus purloined files likely contain at least some trade secrets."" The judge ordered that Uber must use ""the full extent of their corporate, employment, contractual and other authority"" to compel Levandowski to return the documents by May 31 at noon. The injunction on Levandowski's work is part of an order that was revealed on Thursday in sealed documents. Those documents were unsealed Monday morning. The order also denied Uber's argument to move the lawsuit to private arbitration, and referred the case to the U.S attorney general. The result of the order ""tips sharply in Waymo's favor,"" Alsup wrote, although some of Waymo's requests were also denied. ""Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions. We welcome the order to prohibit Uber's use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research, and to formally bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the technology,"" a Waymo spokesperson told CNBC. ""The court has also granted Waymo expedited discovery and we will use this to further protect our work and hold Uber fully responsible for its misconduct."" Levandowski has already said he would recuse himself from work related to the disputed technology. But an Uber engineer recently testified that Levandowski communicates with the new self-driving boss on a day-to-day basis. The case comes at a time when the self-driving car business is fiercely competitive — and any setback could impact companies' abilities to test their cars on the road and beat rivals to market. Uber has called the case a ""baseless attempt to slow down a competitor."" Indeed, although Alphabet is an Uber investor, Waymo poses challenges to Uber on several fronts. Waymo has also teamed up with Uber-rival Lyft to bolster self-driving car technology. While Levandowski will no longer be able to work on one of the most important sensors for self-driving cars, an Uber spokesperson told CNBC that it is pleased it can continue on its overall technology. ""We are pleased with the court's ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LIDAR,"" an Uber spokesperson told CNBC on Monday.

That shift is a big opportunity for Silicon Valley's technology companies and startups, which are working with existing data to help hospitals take proactive steps to keep their patients healthy. So, for instance, a computer might soon determine the likelihood that certain patients will acquire a potentially life-threatening disease like sepsis, or end up being readmitted after being discharged from the hospital. The advance also addresses a big problem in medical specialties like radiology and pathology, where clinicians are saddled with a massive amount of information and too little time. Even a well-trained human eye can occasionally miss something. Many of the top hospitals have their own technology teams, but they pale in comparison to the computing talent at Google. For Atul Butte, director of the Institute of Computational Health Sciences at UCSF, the draw was Google's amazing in-house machine learning expertise. Butte said the project ""bubbled up"" because UCSF has a wealth of medical data, including admissions reports, medical records, diagnoses, lab results and so on, but it has not yet mined this information to make predictions about patient outcomes. ""This isn't a research project,"" he said. ""It's more of a scientific collaboration around improving the quality of care for patients.""

Christina Farr,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Alphabet's Verily division has hired former FDA chief Dr. Robert Califf as an adviser, the company announced in a blog post Wednesday. Califf will help oversee Project Baseline, a well-funded effort headed by fellow cardiologist Dr. Jessica Mega to study human health by tracking 10,000 people over at least four years. He will also continue to work at the Duke University Clinical Research Institute and have a new appointment as an adjunct professor in the Department of Medicine at Stanford. Duke and Stanford are teaming up with Verily for the baseline study. The appointment of Califf is a big win for Verily, and couldn't come at a better time. The company just lost its top academic, former National Institute of Mental Health chief, Dr. Tom Insel. Califf was nominated for the FDA role by President Barack Obama and stepped down in January, a standard procedure with a new administration. Shortly after stepping down, he spoke out in an interview about the antiquated ways in which companies collect medical data to test drugs and medical devices. He suggested that clinical trials should look more like A/B comparison tests routinely done by tech companies, such as Google. It's not typical for health agency chiefs to join technology companies, but it might increasingly be an option as Silicon Valley starts moving into regulated industries. Verily works closely with life sciences companies including Dexcom, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson on health hardware and software projects. ",Alphabet hires Robert Califf to run Verily health study
Josh Lipton,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Google is partnering with HTC and Lenovo to build standalone virtual reality headsets. The new devices won't require a phone or PC and will be made available to consumers later this year. But VR is a crowded space and Google will have to compete with Oculus, Intel, Samsung and others. According to IDC, global shipments of VR and AR headsets will increase from 10 million units in 2016 to nearly 100 million in 2021. Google's vice president of virtual and augmented reality Clay Bavor says the key technology here is the use of sensors, instead of external cameras or trackers, that makes the experience more realistic. These sensors pinpoint your location in the virtual environment using specific features, like bright dots or sharp corners, ""which makes the view in the virtual world perfectly correspond with your motion in the real world, and it makes for a far higher sense of realism,"" Bavor explained. ""Unless your view in the virtual world exactly corresponds exactly to how you're moving in the real world, when you see and feel different things it can be a little uncomfortable.""

Todd Haselton,05182017,CNBC,05112017,"Picture it: you're standing in the kitchen cooking up a saucy chicken dinner with a bottle of BBQ sauce in one hand and the chicken in another. You want to call your brother to check in, but you can't reach for your smartphone on the other side of the kitchen without putting everything down. Your Amazon Echo is on the counter playing Bruce Springsteen while you cook. Instead of drying your hands and picking up the phone, you can now ask Amazon to call any other Alexa user — like your brother. This is a new feature that Amazon announced earlier this week. Alexa users who own an Echo, or who have the app installed on their iOS or Android smartphone, can now call or message one another for free. You can't call individual rooms yet – like from the dining room up to your kid's bedroom, that feature will launch this summer – but you can call other users. I've been testing it for a couple of days and I'm blown away by how fun it is to use Alexa to place calls. I get a genuine buzz of excitement when I see my Echo suddenly light up with a green light, alerting me that a friend is calling. The calls are clear, too, and Amazon even lets you send voice messages (think of them as a voicemail) or text that can be spoken by Alexa to another user. I can clearly see how Amazon may be able to use the Echo to totally disrupt everything from enterprise phone systems to how and when we communicate by voice. Society has moved away from clunky phone systems at home, at least most of us in the younger ""millennial"" generation, but the Echo, which exists as a smart assistant capable of streaming music, providing sports scores, reading the news and more, isn't a boring old phone. Instead, it can simply double as one. And, better yet, there's no monthly fee to use the feature. Want to try it for yourself? We'll walk you through how to get up and running now. The first thing you need to do is make sure you have the latest Alexa app installed on your iPhone or Android smartphone. Open the Alexa app on your smartphone and then tap the chat bubble at the bottom. Now tap the figure in the upper-right hand corner. This will show a list of your contacts who have the updated app and who are available to call or message. You can call right from your phone by tapping a name. Or you can call from your Alexa by saying ""Alexa, call mom."" To answer a call, simply say ""Alexa answer."" To end, say ""Alexa hang up."" That's all there is to it. When you place a call, it'll ring on another user's phone through the Alexa app, or on every Echo connected to their account. If you want, you can send and receive messages using the Alexa app from the same page you'd place a call. Alexa will either play your recorded voice or translate your text and speak out your message on the other end. There are a couple of hiccups Amazon needs to iron out. The call quality is good but not great – voices sounded a bit hollow on my Amazon Echo Dot. Also, the person at the end of the line can hear you say ""Alexa hang up,"" which is sort of awkward. Also you need to ask your friends to update their apps in order for this to work. That isn't always easy. I love the idea, though, and in a world where many of us have ditched landlines entirely, I think the home phone just got a new shot at life. ",How to make calls with Amazon's Alexa
 ,05182017,Fool,05112017,"NXP Semiconductors has announced that they will be putting out module for IoT that are compatible with Android Things by the end of the year. The modules are targeted at IoT developers, and will allow them to create devices with Google's Android Things IoT subsystem fully integrated, without having to fully develop the support stack from the ground up. While most modules and platforms made for IoT take a ""green grass"" approach and let developers and device creators figure out what they want to use on the software side of things, this new platform is built specifically to support Android Things and the products and benefits that come with it, such as Google Assistant and multi-device interlocking intelligence. NXP is working hand-in-hand with customers to develop products based on this platform that should be available to consumers before the end of the year. NXP, who is a development partner with Amazon's Alexa platform, says that they are currently working with six different customers to help get Android Things products based on their solutions out the door by year's end. They did not name who these six partners are. According to NXP exec Leonardo Azevedo, the company is looking to win over the home audience by helping to spread Android Things out into the larger IoT ecosystem. This means that Google will get to see Android Things grow, while NXP gets to leverage the promise of Android Things to build out a brand new ecosystem and attract customers. Azevedo said that one of the bigger perks of Android Things, when it comes to building a smart home, is cross-device intelligence. Devices can not only figure out which one of them a user may be trying to issue a command to at any given moment, but can also talk to one another to better do their job, or to relay commands throughout a large or cut-off area. NXP has been purchased by Qualcomm, which means that this new platform and the products it makes taking off could mean seeing Qualcomm take a big portion of the smart home ecosystem just as it begins to rise up and become an all-levels, full-service market.

So NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is waiting for the final regulatory approvals to trigger an avalanche of shares being committed to Qualcomm 's (NASDAQ:QCOM) long-running tender offer. The pending buyout may have frozen NXP's stock prices just below Qualcomm's firm all-cash offer of $110 per share, but NXP isn't sitting on its hands while the merger drama plays out. For example, NXP just pledged support for Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Things platform. The embedded semiconductor specialist will ensure that its Internet of Things products come with full support for Android Things. NXP's official support for this embedded software solution includes everything from the i.MX applications processor to the company's low-power Wi-Fi controllers and security chips. In return, Android Things gives NXP a quick and easy development path for clients who want to build next-generation IoT devices. Furthermore, the data safety relationship does not end when you buy one of these connected technology appliances. Google supplies a constant stream of security updates for Android Things devices. Brillo Argon is one of NXP's pre-approved development bases for Android Things. Note the plethora of open connectors. Image source: NXP. Through this platform and NXP's hardware, consumers will be able to access Google Assistant and Chromecast user interfaces for gadgets such as smart home tools, networked home entertainment systems, wearable computing gear, and more. The devices will also enjoy all of Google's work on Android security. A broad consumer-facing platform will always have more resources pouring into their security challenges than any independent, minor-league solution could hope for. That's a big deal. Most of this will fly under the radar from the consumer's point of view, of course. But NXP investors should notice an uptick in IoT product sales as this partnership matures. I mean, Qualcomm investors will be the ones who benefit from NXP's moves today. But you see my point. NXP keeps chipping away at the IoT market in fair weather or foul, making sure that Qualcomm is acquiring a valuable and sprightly business.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a treasure trove of data at its fingertips, and it's been more than willing to spend its financial firepower to take moonshots that could disrupt industries. These moonshots include collaborations with healthcare companies, including Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM), that could eventually reshape healthcare. A full transcript follows the video. Kristine Harjes: Novartis is working with Alphabet's Google's Verily, which was formerly Google Life Sciences, on a smart contact lens that you put in your eye like a normal contact, and it measures blood sugar levels from your tears. So what they're hoping to do is have it change color if the levels aren't within normal range. That's straight sci-fi right there. Todd Campbell: That is crazy. That is fascinating. And then, of course, you have Verily, which is part of Alphabet/Google, however you want to refer to them. Verily is working on a program with Dexcom to create sensors that peel off like little Band-Aids. Obviously, this is going to become a much, like you said, less invasive way of being able to track a disease and provide more information, and then hopefully that information can be used by the patient to at least delay disease progression so that they're not ending up with cardiac risk and risk of death later on in life. Harjes: Right. This is another example of a tech specialist, Google, working with a healthcare-device specialist, which is Dexcom. Dexcom, in case you're not familiar with them, are a continuous glucose monitor, CGM, specialist. Dexcom has all these awesome CGMs that they've already developed, and now they see this tremendous advantage in being able to harness Google's analytic capabilities to make this better. They're working with Verily on developing a CGM that's no bigger than a Band-Aid. There would still be some insertion, because their system is based on a wire, but they're looking at ways other than a needle to insert it, which would not just be a better experience, but hopefully take the cost down. Campbell: You know what's fascinating to me, Google is always on the cutting edge, in the way that they're doing research and discovering new ways and new approaches. They're not just a search engine. A few years ago, they came out with Google Glass. I don't know if our listeners remember Google Glass. Maybe some of them still have them kicking around. It's a head-up display that you attach to your glasses that allows you to access the internet, access information, and communicate with, say, your computer or PC. There are companies out there today that are still using Google Glass to improve healthcare. For example, there's a small company out in California called Augmentix. Augmentix works with physicians. Physicians will walk in to a primary care appointment wearing Google Glass; they'll be able to, through a scribe back at Augmentix HQ, be able to communicate and spend more time with the patient and spend less time on the paperwork. So basically, the scribe is writing down what's occurring, or taking care of the EHR, or electronic [health] medical record component of a physician's job, via the use of Google Glass. There's all sorts of ways that we're not even contemplating that wearables, be it from Google or Fitbit or Apple, or even [Amazon.com], could impact and change healthcare over the course of the coming decades.

Sometimes, winners just keep on winning. This has been the underlying theme for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) so far in 2017. Often collectively referred to as FANG stocks, these four stocks have absolutely trounced the market this year, adding to their huge outperformance in recent years. Here's a close look at these stocks' recent performance, as well as a glimpse at what has been driving their stocks higher, some reasons to be cautious, and what investors should make of these surging stock prices. Image source: Getty Images. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet stocks are up about 30%, 29%, 28%, and 21%, respectively, year to date. These returns leave the S&P 500's 7% rise during this period in the dust. FB data by YCharts. Furthermore, these stocks' big gains in 2017 extend an extraordinary track record for each in recent years. Facebook's, Amazon's, Netflix's, and Alphabet's stock prices are up about 150%, 220%, 220%, and 80%, respectively, compared to three years ago. During this same period, the S&P 500 increased just 27%. Here's a quick look at each stock. Catalysts: Facebook's surging stock price comes as the company's revenue and earnings per share are soaring, driven by strong advertiser demand and continued growth in users. In Facebook's most recent quarter, revenue soared 49% year over year, and earnings per share jumped 73%. The social network's monthly active users were up 17% year over year. Risks: Management has been warning investors that Facebook's revenue growth rates are about to come down meaningfully as the social network laps strong comparisons. It expects increasing ad loads to no longer serve as a key catalyst for revenue growth. If growth rates come down faster than investors are expecting, the stock's premium valuation could get a haircut. Catalysts: Amazon continued to impress investors in 2017, as the company's earnings per share came in significantly above analyst estimates for both quarterly earnings reports published during the year. Higher-than-expected profitability has primarily been driven by Amazon's fast-growing cloud services business, which accounts for the bulk of Amazon's operating profits. Risks: Amazon continues to display an appetite for aggressive investments, even if this means margins take a hit in the near term. While this is the very strategy that has helped fortify the company's market share gains and competitive advantages today, it's always possible that today's investments won't pay off as handsomely in the future as past investments have. Catalysts: Netflix has been proving to investors it can not only continue growing its subscriber base rapidly, but also achieve meaningful profitability while it's at it. For instance, the streaming-TV leader reported its first-ever consolidated profit in its international segment in the first quarter, as mature markets in the segment offset investments in newer international markets. In addition, Netflix's earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40, up significantly from $0.06 in the year-ago quarter. Risks: Investors shouldn't expect Netflix's sudden profitability overseas to stick around. The company is already projecting a small loss in Q2 for its international segment as it invests aggressively in newer markets. Catalysts: Alphabet's revenue and earnings have recently increased nicely, with both coming in ahead of analyst expectations in the first quarter of 2017. The company's strong business growth has been driven primarily by mobile search and YouTube. Furthermore, Alphabet's other revenues segment is also benefiting, thanks to growing revenue from the Android app store, Google-branded hardware, and cloud services. Risks: Alphabet's ""other bets"" segment, which includes some of the company's ""moonshot"" side businesses like Nest, Verily, and Fiber, may account for a small portion of Alphabet's revenue, but it's weighing pretty heavily on overall operating income. The segment lost $855 million in the first quarter of 2017, worse than a $774 million loss in the year-ago quarter. If Alphabet can't turn some of these other bets into winners, the segment could drag on results. Image source: Getty Images. Beyond these fundamental risks for each stock, all four of these companies are up against a common and unforgiving foe: high expectations. Investors have priced sustained, high levels of growth into all four of these stocks' valuations. So investors would be wise to take the time to fully understand what these companies will need to do to live up to their valuations. Investors shouldn't automatically conclude it's time to sell just because of these stocks' recent sharp increases and their pricey valuations. I don't believe investors interested in these stocks are too late to the game. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet continue to benefit from their strong competitive positions in their respective markets, and their underlying businesses look stronger than ever. Of course, investors should expect volatility. Given the significant growth expectations baked into these companies' valuations, a slight shift in sentiment about their long-term prospects could spark large swings in their stock prices. On the other hand, if investors continue to wait for these market leaders' stocks to fall to bargain territory, they might miss out entirely. Ultimately, even after an impressive start to 2017, FANG stocks continue to look like the sort of companies investors should want in their portfolios over the next 10 years. ","

Signing a mortgage is quite the commitment. Not only are you locked into what could be a sizable monthly payment, but you're also pledging to continue paying that amount every month for up 30 years of your life. And while paying off a mortgage early is easier said than done, here are a few good reasons to eliminate that debt sooner than you technically have to. Countless seniors struggle to pay the bills in retirement, so much so that an estimated 25 million of them live below the poverty line. Since housing is one of the greatest expenses seniors face, it stands to reason that taking your mortgage payment out of the mix can make for a more financially secure retirement. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. One reason so many households struggle to pay for college (aside from the exorbitant price tag, of course) is that their existing bills don't magically go away by the time those tuition payments come due. But if you manage to pay off your mortgage by the time your kids go off to college, you'll have extra cash on hand to cover those costs. Freeing up cash for college will help you and your children avoid hefty loans -- loans that countless borrowers struggle to pay off. Last year, the average college grad came away over $37,000 in debt, so if paying off your mortgage early cuts that number significantly, your kids will have a much less stressful start to adulthood. Mortgage lenders make money by collecting interest, so the sooner you pay off your home loan, the less it'll ultimately cost you. Imagine you have a 30-year, $300,000 fixed mortgage at 4% interest. Now let's say that 10 years in, you make an extra $10,000 payment toward your principal. That move alone will save you close to $12,000 in interest -- money that go a long way toward retirement, college, or whatever other purpose you choose to use it for. While paying off your mortgage early might seem appealing in theory, it's a harder feat to accomplish in practice. But if you're willing to make the effort, here are a few tips that'll help you eliminate that debt sooner: One final thing: While paying off your mortgage early can open the door to major savings and give you more financial flexibility to meet different goals, make sure your loan doesn't impose penalties for prepayment. While most mortgages don't penalize borrowers for paying off their debt early, some do, so it's important to weigh your prospective savings against the fees you'll be charged. ","
      
    3 Reasons to Pay Off Your Mortgage Early  -- The Motley Fool

The virtual reality (VR) market, which is estimated to reach up to $45 billion for gaming alone by 2025, shows early potential for mainstream use, but there are limitations to using the technology that need to be overcome in order for VR to reach mass adoption. We'll review these limitations, but first let's look at one VR product that is being rapidly adopted, and what the device's success says about the broader market for the technology. One big success in the VR space has been Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard. Yes, it's a virtual reality device actually made out of cardboard, which means it's relatively cheap costing only $15. More advanced VR devices like Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) Playstation VR cost hundreds of dollars. Alphabet's Cardboard is cheap not only because its made out of cardboard but because its also designed to be good at simple things like viewing photos and videos. Recently, Alphabet announced it has shipped over 10 million Cardboard viewers since the product launched in 2014. There were as many Cardboards shipped in 2016 as the first two years, which shows accelerating adoption. Google Cardboard. IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET INC. The success of Google Cardboard is proof that there is interest in VR. Cardboard users have downloaded 160 million Cardboard apps on Google Play, demonstrating that people enjoy using it for the simple tasks it was designed for. Unfortunately for all it's doing to get people using VR technology, Cardboard also highlights what is wrong with higher end VR headsets. More expensive, high-tech VR headsets from Facebook, HTC (NASDAQOTH:HTCKF), and Sony haven't been as successful, having shipped only hundreds of thousands of units in 2016. Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Gear VR shipped 4.5 million units in 2016, which stands out from the much lower totals of Sony's Playstation VR, Facebook's Oculus Rift, and the HTC Vive. But Samsung Gear VR retails for $130, a fraction of the cost of the other headsets. Obviously, price is a key factor in people's decision to buy one of these devices. The cheap build and low price of Alphabet's Cardboard highlights another feature working in its favor -- simplicity. Cardboard is just a little rectangular box you hold up to your eyes. There are no wires, it's not a clunky thing you strap around your head. Cardboard is as simple to use as taking pictures with a smartphone. VR won't take off as a mainstream technology until more advanced VR headsets get cheaper and simpler in design. One of the other key differences between Cardboard and the more advanced VR systems is that Cardboard only requires a smartphone to use. Some advanced VR headsets for gaming and other graphically intense applications require a high-end gaming PC to operate properly, which adds to the expense of using VR. VR headsets made for consoles, on the other hand, such as Sony's Playstation VR, may have an advantage over headsets made to work with PCs, since consoles are cheaper and are dedicated to gaming, not to mention that Playstation VR is already priced about 30% less than the $600 Oculus Rift. Virtual reality has big growth opportunities for areas besides gaming. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Companies developing VR technology would do best not to rush anything, to be patient in getting a product to market, and take advantage of using cheaper versions of VR technology like Alphabet's Cardboard or Samsung's Gear VR as a way to introduce the masses to the new technology to ensure everyone who uses it has a good experience, and doesn't drain your bank account.

A full transcript follows the video. Dylan Lewis: You also think the company's hosting strategy as well is short-sighted, as well. This is something that a lot of companies haven't done. Rather than investing in their own infrastructure, whether it's building out their own data centers, or doing co-located facilities for their servers, Snap is relying entirely on third-party cloud infrastructure providers. That's kind of new. I know you've been a skeptic of that in the past. Evan Niu: Yeah, it's a very unique strategy. If you look at it from Snap's perspective, the benefits they're saying of why they do it this way is, I think one is reliability and resilience, because AWS and Google Cloud are extremely powerful. That way, they can ensure the services are up-and-running. If you remember Twitter in the early days, it had outages all the time because they had so much trouble scaling because people were coming to the service so quickly, it was overwhelming Twitter's own servers, and their in-house infrastructure that caused constant outages. So, by relying on AWS and Google Cloud, Snap can avoid that, because those clouds are so strong that it's really unlikely they're going to be hit with an outage. Of course, it could happen. But there's much less risk of that happening. The other piece of it is, they're trying to save all this money on capital expenditures. Capital expenditures last quarter were very low. They're always low for Snap, because that's just how they approach their cloud stuff. It was $18 million or something. On the call, they mentioned, ""We estimate that using a capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures,"" which is true, but if you turn around, they've also committed to spending $3 billion at AWS and Google Cloud over the next five years, combined. You're not really saving that money, you're still spending it, you're just, instead of spending money on capital expenditures and having that asset on your balance sheet where you depreciate over time and it's your infrastructure, now you're relying completely on these third parties. Those are variable costs. That's going to be a really big challenge for scaling, because those costs are going to scale, too. They did renegotiate their contract pricing during the quarter with both AWS and Google Cloud. They did say that lower contract pricing did help their cost structure a little bit. And if you're looking at it from Amazon or Google's perspective, Snap is a huge customer in the space. They're probably one of the biggest customers out there with these types of spending commitments. These are the two biggest cloud providers, so of course they're going to be bidding pretty aggressively and competing for this contract, and I'm sure Snap is pitting them against each other and really leveraging that in negotiating. So, yeah, they are getting some better pricing now. But, it just doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy. If you really want to have good long-term growth, you just build infrastructure yourself, eat the costs up front, but then you can scale so much better. Lewis: Yeah. You talked about it being variable and somewhat subjective to pricing negotiations. This most recent quarter, hosting costs ate up 70% of revenue, and that's actually down from the last couple quarters where it was up near 80% a few quarters ago. Niu: A year ago, it was like 160% -- hosting costs exceeded revenue a year ago. Lewis: Yeah, I'm not sure how much further that's going to fall. We might continue to see it move down into the high 60s, or something like that. But, I don't know how much lower that floor is going to be. But, it really speaks to how their cost structure is very different than a Facebook, a company that has decided to build out, what, seven data centers at this point? Niu: Nine. Lewis: Nine? Wow. So, rather than have that fixed cost, like you said, as they have more people using the platform, and more people using the platform longer, the cost for them doing that is going to continue to go up, which is something that could be good or bad, it depends on your outlook and what you value for the business. Niu: It gives them more flexibility if things start heading down, if people stop using the platform and users start abandoning Snapchat. Then it's better, in that situation, because you're not stuck with all this infrastructure you have built, and your costs will scale down. But, obviously, Snap is hoping things go up, in which case, it's really hard. They're getting squeezed by these costs, and I think it's really short-sighted. But to be fair, they have hinted that they might pursue their own infrastructure at some point in the future. But, they were very vague about it in the prospectus. They didn't specify timing, and, of course, they do have spending commitments for five-plus years. So it doesn't seem like if they do it on their own, it would be within the next five years, at least. ","

Shares of Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) got a much-needed shot in the arm after the company's third-quarter fiscal 2017 results easily bested Wall Street's expectations. The human interface solutions provider's revenue jumped 10% year-over-year (to $444.2 million), translating into $1.27 per share in earnings. By comparison, analysts were expecting $1.20 per share in earnings on $430 million in revenue. Synaptics' results were warmly received, and the stock shot up 6% during the post-earnings action, bringing relief to investors amid speculation that the company could lose business from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). More importantly, CEO Richard Bergman provided clarity about the company's next big growth driver -- edge-to-edge smartphone displays -- where Synaptics is trying to lead the field with its product development moves. Image Source: Synaptics The display of Samsung's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, covers the front of the device almost entirely. This has led to the elimination of the home button, which traditionally houses the fingerprint sensor to unlock the device. Samsung had been collaborating with Synaptics to integrate the fingerprint scanning technology into the display, but it wasn't ready in time for deployment into the Galaxy S8. Instead, Samsung had to place Synaptics' fingerprint sensor at the back of the device, near the camera, just before the device went into production. Industry sources are reportedly blaming Synaptics' delayed development for Samsung's last-minute change. But it's really no surprise it wasn't ready. The semiconductor specialist currently has the ""only workable solution"" to integrate the fingerprint scanner into the touchscreen, per Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri. And Synaptics' FS9100 optical fingerprint sensor -- which can scan fingerprints through 1mm of glass -- was only launched in December 2016. Synaptics started sampling it to customers in the first quarter this year and the company had indicated that mass production would begin only in the second quarter. So people shouldn't have expected the sensor to be in the Galaxy S8. Synaptics' product lead in this market and its Samsung partnership will play a crucial role in capturing a bigger share of the TDDI space. IHS Markit forecasts that TDDI chip demand will jump to 654 million units in 2022 compared to this year's projected shipments of 100 million units. Synaptics is one of just three companies in this space, and is the only one to have licensed its intellectual property to display panel makers. Leaked specs of what purports to be the next iPhone's case molding (via Slash Leaks) indicates that Apple won't go the Samsung route by placing the Touch ID on the back of the device. Instead, it could integrate the device into the rumored OLED display and remove the iconic home button in the process. But an Apple move toward TDDI doesn't guarantee Synaptics a slot inside the device, as Cupertino has been reportedly developing an in-house display and fingerprint sensor integration technology. Motley Fool contributor Ashraf Eassa believes it highly unlikey that the iPhone maker bought AuthenTec to build Touch IDs in-house for just a few iPhone models. This makes sense, and indicates that Apple could be developing its own system. However, Synaptics can still hope for a spot if Apple's product development falls behind schedule. But investors shouldn't worry too much even if the chipmaker doesn't land a spot in the next iPhone thanks to the end market's secular growth. As mentioned earlier, sales of TDDI chips are estimated to boom in the long run, and Synaptics is probably the best-positioned company to take advantage of the opportunity. This is because Apple is unlikely to license its technology to other smartphone companies, using it exclusively for its iPhones. Japan Display, the other operator in this space, is primarily a flat-panel display provider, so it might find it difficult to license its technology to rival display makers. Synaptics, therefore, is sitting on a huge opportunity that could give its revenue a nice boost in the long run. ","

According to a recent report from job search and review site Glassdoor, the 10 highest-paying tech companies in the U.S. all offer median total compensations at least three times higher than the national average annual income of $44,148. The rapid advancement of the tech industry has Silicon Valley companies fiercely competing for the best talent. While many of these companies have unique ways of attracting talent -- such as unlimited vacation days, free meals, and onsite and nap rooms -- salaries are steadily rising as well. Here's the list of the 10 highest-paying Silicon Valley companies by median total compensation. Image source: Salesforce. salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) develops software solutions specifically for customer-relations management (or CRM, hence the stock ticker). However, the company has been increasing its focus on other future industry drivers as well -- most notably, artificial intelligence. Salesforce's median salary, according to the Glassdoor report, is $150,000. Image source: LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now owned by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), following a 2016 acquisition for more than $26 billion. This career-focused social media-like platform makes its money from talent-solutions sales and premium subscriptions, but Microsoft bought the company seemingly for access to its community of more than 500 million professional members in over 200 countries. Image source: Juniper Networks. Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) makes the majority of its money through various routing and cloud-computing products, which are sold to other companies around the globe. While the enterprise-networking industry is evolving to meet the increased needs of our highly connected and fast-moving world, Juniper continues to try to lead that change. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., just outside Palo Alto, Juniper Networks employs nearly 10,000 people. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is based in Seattle. However, the segment of the company responsible for designing and engineering Amazon's growing portfolio of hardware items, called Amazon Lab126, is in Silicon Valley. Amazon has taken a lot of interesting turns in the past decade and is now increasing its focus on hardware such as its Fire tablet, Kindle e-reader, Amazon Fire TV, and, of course, the Amazon Echo. Image source: NVIDIA. Chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) currently serves various high-growth industries, from gaming to virtual reality to autonomous vehicles. It can afford to be generous to its employees thanks to its incredible business performance. In its most recent fiscal year, NVIDIA's sales grew by 38% over the previous year, and its stock is up nearly 700% over the past five years. Image source: Facebook. In its 13 short years of existence, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has become one of the biggest companies in the U.S. by market capitalization. That's a result of the company's massive advertising business, which in 2016 brought in sales of $26.9 billion -- more than five times the company's 2012 sales -- as Facebook prepares to reach a total user base of 2 billion in 2017. To fuel that growth, Facebook is investing in various new projects, such as artificial intelligence and virtual hangouts called Facebook Spaces. Image source: Alphabet / Google. Google, a division of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) since the company's restructuring in 2015, has long been a pioneer in designing employee benefit and engagement programs. The company offers valuable perks, such as robust maternal and paternal leave, as well as onsite gourmet chefs and personal trainers. It also offers some of the highest paychecks in the country -- Google's median salary, according to Glassdoor, is $155,250. Cadence employees in Taiwan. Image source: Cadence Design Systems. Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) creates integrated circuits and other technologies that help their corporate clients bring electronic devices to market. Cadence works with companies across various technology subsectors, from electronics systems and semiconductor companies to internet service providers. Shares of Cadence Design are up around 230% over the past five years, bringing them near the all-time high they reached in 1998. Image source: Splunk's official Facebook page. Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) is a data management and analysis company that offers what it calls ""the leading platform for Operational Intelligence."" With an ever-growing amount of data being collected from billions of connected devices, Splunk's ability to take messy and unstructured data and turn it into valuable insights has made it hugely successful in the past few years. Splunk has also come up with a smart and lucrative pricing strategy: The more data it interprets, the more it charges -- and the amount of usable data is growing exponentially. Image source: VMWare. And finally, the tech company with the highest median pay in America, by Glassdoor's calculations, is cloud-computing storage and software company VMWare (NYSE:VMW). VMWare, which achieved sales of over $7 billion in 2016, was purchased by Dell last year, though it continues to operate as an independent, publicly traded company. Of course, San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the world: The median home value is more than $1 million. Employees there and in the nearby areas that make up Silicon Valley have a substantially higher cost of living than most areas in the United States. These tech companies can only keep up with their high rents and salaries because they're capitalizing on their industries' incredible growth. ","

Timothy Green,05182017,Fool,05112017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) dropped on Wednesday in reaction to the company's Analyst Day event Tuesday afternoon. While AMD revealed new information about upcoming products and laid out long-term financial targets, investors were left underwhelmed. The stock declined as much as 9.7% Wednesday morning, settling into an 9.25% loss by 11:45 a.m. EDT. AMD laid out its plan to return to profitability. The company expects to grow revenue by a low double-digit percentage in 2017, with the bottom line boosted by a rising gross margin. Positive non-GAAP net income is expected, although AMD didn't provide a specific target. AMD expects to continue to grow revenue by a double-digit percentage annually through 2020, with gross margin rising above 40% and non-GAAP EPS reaching $0.75. A focus on premium products with high margins will be the driver behind the growth. Image source: AMD. In terms of products, AMD announced that Ryzen Mobile and the commercial orientated Ryzen Pro will be launching in the second half, and the 16-core Threadripper desktop CPU will be available in the summer. AMD also announced the first product built around its high-end Vega GPU, the Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, which targets professional applications. EPYC, AMD's upcoming server processors previously codenamed Naples, will launch in June. There are two things that could be responsible for driving down AMD's stock price on Wednesday. First, the stock already traded for 17 times what the company hopes to earn in 2020 going into Wednesday, a valuation investors may be realizing is too optimistic. Second, AMD failed to confirm a rumor that emerged on Tuesday that it had struck a graphics licensing deal with Intel. The lack of confirmation could mean that it's still nothing more than a rumor. AMD is targeting the premium segment of both the PC CPU and GPU markets, where it will face stiff competition from Intel and NVIDIA. In the server CPU market, it will need to show its customers that its EPYC CPUs offer a clear value proposition compared to Intel's offerings. If any part of that plan gets derailed, AMD will miss its long-term targets, which are already baked into the stock price. The slump on Wednesday is another instance of investors realizing that the optimism surrounding AMD was overdone. The stock nearly quadrupled in 2016, but it took a hit after a lackluster first-quarter report, and it's taking another hit after the long-term outlook simply wasn't enough to justify the stock price. AMD may outperform its targets, with its new products performing better than expected. But the company has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, so I wouldn't bet on it. ","

The marijuana industry seemingly can't be stopped at the moment, and marijuana stocks are relishing the momentum. According to cannabis research firm ArcView, North American legal weed sales, which includes both recreational and medical products, soared by 34% to $6.9 billion last year. By 2021, ArcView sees legal pot sales nearing the $22 billion mark. Investment firm Cowen & Co. looked even further and projects $50 billion in legal cannabis sales by 2026. The changing public opinion toward marijuana -- support for a national legalization has never been higher -- and select state legislatures' desire to generate tax revenue from the sale of legal cannabis, have been driving forces behind its expansion. Image source: Getty Images. For investors, there are dozens upon dozens of marijuana stocks to choose from. Unfortunately, with emotions running high (no pun intended), investors may be buying into weed stocks for all the wrong reasons, or worse yet, without fully understanding the risks they may deal with by purchasing volatile pot stocks. With this in mind, we're taking the time to examine one marijuana stock each week until all the major players (those with a market cap in excess of $200 million), have been covered. Here are the marijuana stocks we've discussed so far: Today, we're going to take a deeper dive into Canopy Growth Corp. (NYSE:CGC). Continuing the trio of major Canadian medical marijuana players, Canopy Growth is a producer and retailer of medical cannabis products and oils in our neighbor to the north. It's also the only other marijuana stock other than GW Pharmaceuticals to bear a $1 billion valuation for the time being. For those who may not be aware, Canada legalized the use of medical cannabis to treat certain ailments all the way back in 2001, so there's been a budding medical weed industry in the country for more than a decade. The company currently has six licensed facilities and approximately 665,000 square feet of production growing capacity. Image source: Getty Images. One of the primary reasons investors should be intrigued by Canopy Growth Corp. is the company's current competitive advantage: its size. A number of the company's peers have chosen to grow organically. This includes Aphria, which is funding its approximately $100 million Phase IV expansion to 1 million square feet of production, and Aurora Cannabis, which is currently constructing its technologically advanced 800,000 square foot Aurora Sky project. This will boost its production capacity from less than 100,000 square feet to nearly 900,000 square feet. Canopy Growth, on the other hand, has been an aggressive acquirer. Its recently closed acquisition of Mettrum Health increased its number of licensed facilities to six, boosted its production capacity, and gave the company two new cannabis brands with which to market. Having the highest production capacity of its peers, at least for the time being, could lead to advantages when it comes to meeting an increase in demand from Canadian customers. It's also worth mentioning that the purchase of Mettrum gave Canopy Growth access to about half of Canada's medical marijuana market. More market share could lead to better pricing power, which could improve gross margin. Another key catalyst for Canopy Growth is the expectation that Canada will legalize recreational weed. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has championed that he would legalize recreational pot during his tenure, and he introduced legislation in April that would do just that. If approved, legal pot could be sold to any adult over the age of 21 by as early as July 1, 2018. Recreational weed legalization in Canada could add $5 billion to $7 billion in annual revenue, which is a huge pie that Canopy Growth and its other peers would want a piece of. Image source: Getty Images. Also, in June, a medical marijuana bill was signed into law in Mexico, legalizing medical cannabis. It's unclear if Mexico offers Canadian medical cannabis producers a large market opportunity given its history of cartels, but it represents another potential revenue channel for Canopy Growth. Lastly, we're seeing a pretty marked ramp-up in sales growth, likely driven by its recognizable Tweed brand and its notable partnerships, which includes strains bearing rapper Snoop Dogg's name. Fiscal fourth-quarter sales increased 191% year-over-year and 50% from the sequential third quarter. But as we've seen with other marijuana stocks, no company is without its risks. One clear concern for a company like Canopy Growth is that it's valued at $1.7 billion, yet its sales and net losses don't appear to warrant such a frothy valuation, even inclusive of its competitive size advantages in Canada. In fiscal 2017, sales more than tripled compared to previous year, but they totaled just $31 million. Similarly, while the company delivered adjusted profits in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, acquisition-related costs dragged its full-year results to a loss. Canopy Growth's valuation definitely narrows down the list of investors who'd consider investing in the company. Image source: Getty Images. Political concerns are another issue that marijuana stock investors need to consider. For instance, even though Trudeau recently submitted legislation to legalize recreational cannabis, he's been suggesting he'd do so for years without any true progress. There are no guarantees that Canada will take the next step in the legalization process. Likewise, in the U.S. it's possible that the Trump administration could tighten rather than loosen federal regulations surrounding the marijuana industry in the years to come. Canopy Growth Corp. is also facing a growing sea of competition. Once Aurora Cannabis' Aurora Sky project is finished and the Phase IV expansion for Aphria is complete (which is expected next year), Canopy Growth may not have a production capacity advantage over its peers. Finally, there's the question of whether Canopy Growth can grow its business organically. It's done well with partnering and marketing its product to its medical cannabis audience, but it's grown almost exclusively through acquisitions in recent years. There's no guarantee that growth by acquisition is a sustainable long-term strategy, or that the company will have the capital to continue its aggressive acquisition spree. Now for the all-important question for marijuana stock investors: Should you consider buying Canopy Growth? Image source: Getty Images. On one hand, there's clear demand growth in Canada, and much of North America stands on the verge of major change (e.g., Canada possibly legalizing recreational pot, and U.S. states considering expansion). It doesn't appear that there's enough supply on the market to meet what could be a flood of demand, so that's clearly playing into the ""buy"" thesis, assuming Canada moves forward with recreational legalization as expected. The company's branding efforts should also be commended. Canopy Growth has probably done a better job than any retailer in attempting to vertically integrate its business and engage its customers with recognizable ambassadors and products. At the same time, the valuations of marijuana stocks are in the stratosphere, and Canopy Growth is no exception. Despite its rapid sales growth, it could take years before its aggressive valuation remotely makes sense. For now, I'd suggest monitoring Canopy Growth from the sidelines until we get a definitive answer from Canada's government on recreational weed, and we see a clear improvement in its bottom-line.

""We assume that Waymo first generates positive operating profit in 2022 and that its operating margin reaches 8% by 2030."" Waymo is part of Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" projects – companies which are not part of Google's core business – and Morgan Stanley said the high valuation, coupled with possible legal issues in the autonomous vehicles makes it a prime target for a spin-off. ""We see Waymo facing material regulatory and (likely) legal risk as it continues to drive the autonomous vehicle transition that parent-company Alphabet may not necessarily wish to be directly exposed to,"" according to Morgan Stanley.

Nathan Reiff,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs In the fast-moving hedge fund world, information is often only useful while it is new and timely. For this reason, quarterly reports that funds file with the SEC in compliance with 13-F regulations are not as timely and, therefore, not as directly applicable as other types of information. However, 13Fs are valuable to outside investors because they offer a special look inside a portion of a hedge fund's investments. In the case of Julian Robertson, the billionaire head of Tiger Management, the 13-F can show areas in which Tiger supported growing trends among leading investors. The details of Tiger's 13-F for Q1 of 2017 are below. One of the most significant changes that Tiger made to its portfolio in the first three months of the year was to sell off Apple (AAPL) stock. In this way, Julian Robertson joins a growing list of big-name investors to either trim AAPL considerably or exit positions entirely. Appaloosa Management, Third Point, and others have all done the same. Robertson sold out of AAPL stock completely in the first quarter. That was not the only stock that Tiger eliminated from its portfolio in the first quarter. Robertson also exited positions in Citigroup (C), Holly Frontier (HZNP), and L Brands (LB). At the same time, he cut his positions in both Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB). With the sale of certain stocks often comes the purchase of new names in other areas. In the first quarter, Tiger bought up 220,000 shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE). This launches the software developer into the top five positions in Robertson's portfolio, where it now occupies the fifth largest allocation. At the same time, Robertson also took up a new position in JPMorgan. Tiger did not seem to be shifting toward financials in the first quarter, however, as it also sold off some of its positions in Bank of America (BAC) and Blackstone (BX). It is important to keep in mind that 13-F reports do not necessarily reflect all of the different buys and sells taking place for a fund in a particular quarter. While Robertson ended the first quarter in these positions, the filing does not reveal whether he bought and sold all at once or if these are net changes that were amassed via a number of smaller transactions. Similarly, because 13-Fs are backdated to the prior quarter, it is likely that Robertson's current portfolio looks different from what his 13-F revealed. Nonetheless, when larger trends emerge among prominent investors, including the widespread sell-off of Apple stock that occurred early in the year, the effects on the broader investment world can often be long-lasting.

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Investors poured $1 billion into tech stocks last week, the highest annualized pace in 15 years, according to research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a division of Bank of America Corp. By contrast, a total of $8.9 billion was withdrawn from equities overall during the same week, per the same Merrill Lynch report, according to Bloomberg. The mania for tech stocks persists despite rich valuations and last week's pullback in tech shares amid growing concerns that President Donald Trump's proposed tax break for repatriated overseas profits won't get enacted, the Wall Street Journal reports. The ten largest tech companies have accumulated a $545 billion pile of cash abroad, waiting to be redeployed in the U.S. for everything from stock buybacks to dividends should a repatriation tax break pass. The five biggest contributors to the gain in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) so far this year are tech stocks, per analysis by Bloomberg, all up by an average of 26%. These five are Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Facebook Inc. (FB) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). They represent five of the six largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, along with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B), per CNBC. Hedge funds were net sellers of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet in the first quarter, missing out on continued gains, Bloomberg says, speculating that these fund managers may regret their premature sales and are diving back into techs. The tech rally is not confined to the biggest players. Overall, 84% of tech stocks are up so far in 2017, Bloomberg adds. (For more, see also: Why Investors Are Doubling Down on Tech Stocks and Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) There is good reason that investors view profit repatriation positively for the techs, and also good reason for concern that it may not happen. The Nasdaq Composite index and stocks such as Apple, Google and Facebook slipped sharply last week on news of the expanding political crisis at the White House, which may dim the chances of any repatriation happening. Overseas cash balances account for a stunning 28% of the combined market caps of Apple, Microsoft, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the Journal computes. These cash balances so far have been used as collateral for domestic debt, borrowing that could be reduced significantly if a repatriation tax break passes, the Journal reports. (For more, see also: Why Corporate Bond Issuance May Plunge.) While the big tech names sport high valuations, the Journal notes that their price-earnings (P/E) ratios would drop significantly if you deduct their huge balances from their market caps. For example, Apple is valued at almost 16x forward earnings, a five-year high, but this valuation drops by about 21%, to 12.7x, if you exclude the company's net cash, the Journal calculates.

Year to date, 85 members of the S&P 500 are up 20 percent or more. Of that group, 23 stocks, or more than a quarter of the total, are technology companies, and that does not include some surging internet stocks that are classified as consumer discretionary names. With the technology sector partying like it's 1999, investors are sending billions of dollars of capital into technology funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ""Investors ranging from institutional accounts to retail clients plowed about $1 billion into tech stocks during the past week, pushing inflows to the highest annualized pace in 15 years, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report. Overall, equities saw $8.9 billion in outflows during the period, the bank said,"" reports Bloomberg. (See also: Participate in the Tech Rally With These ETFs.) While that is an impressive week of work for technology funds, some ETFs tracking the sector have been steadily raking in new assets since the start of the year. For example, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the largest technology ETF by assets, has added $1.66 billion in new assets this year on its way to a gain of 14.7 percent. XLK has been buoyed by some familiar faces. Among those tech stocks that are up 20 percent or more this year are Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook Inc. (FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). Those stocks combine for about one-third of XLK's weight. (See also: A Look at the Technology Sector SPDR ETF.) The Fidelity MSCI Information Tech ETF (FTEC​) is also seeing an influx of new assets this year. FTEC, the least expensive technology ETF in the U.S. with an annual fee of just 0.084 percent, has seen almost $220 million of its just over $910 million in assets come into the fund this year. Like XLK, FTEC is a cap-weighted ETF, and the Fidelity offering allocates over 32 percent of its combined weight to Apple, Facebook and Alphabet. (See also: A Cost-Efficient ETF for Apple Investors.) ""What's more, 30 percent gains in Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. have continued to help the rally, but 84 percent of technology stocks have seen positive returns this year,"" Bloomberg reported, citing Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The technology sector now accounts for almost 23 percent of the S&P 500, more than 900 basis points ahead of the roughly 13.9 percent that the index allocates to healthcare and financial services stocks.

As self-driving cars free up drivers, they also see the potential for Google’s advertising services to monetize the riders as they browse the internet. The analysts calculated the enterprise value based on the assumption that Waymo cars will be used in about 1% of all global miles driven by 2030. This number is based off a fleet of three million cars that each drive about 65,000 miles a year. If the self-driving cars charged about $1.25 per mile in a ride-hailing program like Lyft’s, it would lead to a $70 billion valuation that would add about 12% to Alphabet’s overall enterprise value, the analysts contend. Experts have said Waymo’s technology is among the best in the self-driving field, but that it has been held back by a lack of commercialization and overshadowed by Tesla Inc.

Don’t miss: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips Still, the analysts do not expect Waymo to generate a positive operating profit until 2022 and expect Waymo to continue to invest in the technology, which could weigh on margins. The analysts currently value the overall “other bets” segment, which includes Nest, a provider of smart home products, internet provider Fiber and Verily, a life-sciences unit, at negative $21 billion. Alphabet’s “other bets” segment contributed $244 million in revenue in the first-quarter of 2017, up from $165 million in the year-earlier period. It posted a wider operating loss of $855 million, however, compared with $774 million in the year-earlier period. Waymo is also locked in a lawsuit with Uber Technologies Inc., a competitor of Lyft, over self-driving technology Waymo purports was stolen by a former employee and brought to Uber. See also: The tech behind Google-Uber legal beef could be ready to boom While Waymo’s strong business case could lead to a spinoff of the company, the spinoff may also be a regulatory necessity for Alphabet, as the analysts surmise that the company may not want to be the first to test the U.S. court system as questions about the cars’ safety arise. “We see Waymo facing material regulatory and (likely) legal risk as it continues to drive the autonomous vehicle transition that parent-company Alphabet may not necessarily wish to be directly exposed to,” Nowak wrote.

Only 20% of human resources managers reported that their firms allowed their staff to clock off early summer Fridays, down from 63% in 2012, according to the results of a survey of 300 HR managers at companies with 20 or more employees from OfficeTeam, a subsidiary of human resources consulting firm Robert Half. The situation could be even stricter for workers, according to a 2015 survey of 15,723 Americans by Google Consumer Surveys in May 2015. That study found that only 8% of workers received additional time off in the summer, and nearly a third of those who did receive extra vacation time said that their bosses wanted them to remain connected while away from the office. Employers are cutting back on other perks they provide workers during the summer months. Only 62% of companies now offer flexible schedules in the summertime, down from 75% five years ago. And less than a third of firms allowed a relaxed dress code in summer — in 2012, more than half of HR managers said they offered this perk. All hope of a summer break may not be lost though. The reduction in summer perks could point to companies becoming more accommodating throughout the year, said Cynthia Kong, a senior public relations manager for OfficeTeam. “One theory is that many companies are already offering flexible schedules, remote work options and relaxed dress codes throughout the year,” Kong said. Whether during the summer or year-round, there’s good incentive for employers to offer these kinds of perks — and to encourage employees to take advantage of them. Researchers have found that happier employees are more productive than those who are stressed out. And more than one-third of HR managers in the latest OfficeTeam survey reported that employees were less productive during the summer months. Benefits like flexible scheduling and even in-office activities like potlucks or ice cream socials during the summer can improve morale among employees, said Evren Esen, director of workforce analytics at the Society for Human Resource Management. “Everyone likes the idea of having a break from the regular routine,” she said. And yet American workers have a bad habit of letting their vacation days go to waste. Some 55% of Americans didn’t use all of their vacation days, according to a study released last year by the U.S. Travel Association’s Project Time Off. A recent survey by personal-finance site Bankrate.com found that one in four millennials between the ages of 18 and 25 didn’t use any of their vacation days in 2016.

While Alphabet’s market valuation is a ways from topping the GDP of either of the country’s other two biggest cities, Apple’s market cap is less than 4% away from surpassing the GDP of Los Angeles, which had a real GDP of $832 billion last year and was the second biggest city in the country by this metric. The iPhone maker has its work cut out for it, however, if its market value is to exceed the GDP of New York City. Apple, in fact, would need to grow in market cap by about 85% for that figure to top the Big Apple‘s GDP, checking in last year at the eye-popping level of $1.483 trillion. While some analysts speculate that Apple could surpass $1 trillion in market cap within 12 to 18 months—itself an unprecedented feat—the City That Never Sleeps can rest easy for a while. Even if you combine Apple’s and Alphabet’s market values, New York’s GDP figure would stand 2% above.

In the year following its offering, Facebook analysts were concerned that the company was overvalued and that its revenue and user numbers were not growing quickly enough. Now, Snap is facing similar issues, as the company’s March 2 debut was quickly followed by analysts saying the stock was overvalued and concerns about its user growth and competition from, funnily enough, Facebook. Facebook stands out from the pack in the scope it offered before going public, though. Snap went public at a market capitalization of $19.7 billion. Facebook went public with a market cap of $104 billion, which has since grown to about $419.7 billion.

Ryan Vlastelica,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: May 22, 2017 8:53 a.m. ET People laughed when Bernie Madoff volunteered to keep his prison’s books By Shortly after Bernie Madoff arrived in prison, at the start of a 150-year sentence, the mastermind behind the largest fraud in financial history was slapped across the face. Madoff was closely following the way his case was being reported in the media and had gone to the jail’s TV room to watch “60 Minutes.” When he changed the channel—in defiance of the prison’s unwritten rules, he soon learned—another inmate objected and wanted it changed back. There was a scuffle, and then a smack on the cheek. It was then that Carmine John Persico Jr., the notorious boss of the Colombo crime family known as “The Snake,” who has been serving his own century-plus sentence at the same prison, intervened. “Carmine sent his boys over, or his ‘friends,’ rather, to ‘have a talk’ with the guy who delivered the slap,” recounted Steve Fishman, a journalist who has covered Madoff for years. Persico’s men “issued what Madoff called ‘an extraordinarily stern warning,’ and talked it all out. After that, Bernie got to watch” whatever he wanted. It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship between a pair of notorious, geriatric inmates (Madoff is just shy of 80, and Persico is 83) serving what amounts to life in prison. According to Fishman, the host of “Ponzi Supernova,” an audio series about the case that features extensive interviews with the jailed Madoff, the mobster and the Ponzi schemer have become “good buddies,” with Persico also acting as both protector and mentor to the disgraced former nonexecutive chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market. “It was Carmine who first greeted Bernie when he arrived,” Fishman said. “Carmine sent him shower slippers, tried to make him feel at home. Bernie didn’t know the rules of prison, and that was something Carmine was able to help with.” The NYPD Organized Crime Task Force suspects that Persico, who served as his own attorney during his criminal trial in 1987, may be linked to multiple murders; nonetheless, Madoff calls him a “very sweet man,” Fishman said. “He talks about how Carmine was visited by his grandchildren, what a tender scene that was, and how gentle he was with them.” Madoff has lamented his own lack of family visits. The former Wall Street money manager, who once hobnobbed with the deep-pocketed elite, has assembled an unusual fellowship in jail. “He doesn’t really fit into the prison life, which is very segregated by race and sexual orientation, among other things,” Fishman said. “He moves from group to group. He has social relationships with some of the gay prisoners, the child molesters, the mob guys. It doesn’t matter to him.” Madoff is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, N.C. It is a medium-security facility, one that is sometimes referred to as “Camp Fluffy” for being relatively comfortable. Madoff has a picture window in his cell, and his door isn’t locked at night. He has access to a computer, where he fires off emails, and to a kitchen. The prison yard features both a sweat lodge and a bocce court, where Madoff and Persico “hang out,” according to Fishman, who got these details from Madoff himself. As per the rules of the prison, Madoff has various jobs, including working in the commissary, “kind of like a grocery-store clerk,” and mopping the cafeteria floor. Madoff, who cooked his books to the tune of $65 billion, “wanted to do something finance-related,” Fishman reported. “He volunteered to keep the prison’s books, but the supervisor just laughed. ‘I don’t think so,’ he said.” To the extent he can, Madoff has remained somewhat active in finance. As Fishman previously told MarketWatch, Madoff has doled out stock advice to other prisoners—or “colleagues,” as he calls them—and bought up the commissary’s supply of Swiss Miss hot chocolate, cornering the market and ensuring profitable resales. Read: Bernie Madoff is cornering the prison market on Swiss Miss hot chocolate Mostly, however, he spends his free time reading and talking with his lawyers. Fishman suspects he continues to have contact with Ruth Madoff, his estranged wife, but couldn’t say definitively. Madoff stays apprised of the fallout from his Ponzi scheme, and even watched the miniseries that was produced about his crimes last year. His only objection to the film, according to Fishman, was a scene in which Richard Dreyfuss—who plays the title role—slaps one of his sons. He took umbrage to that particular characterization. “People forget, but he really was a good family man,” Fishman said. “He was very careful about how his relationship with his family was portrayed.” Both of Madoff’s sons died after the fraud was uncovered. Mark Madoff hanged himself on the second anniversary of his father’s arrest, while Andrew Madoff, at the time the last surviving progeny of the swindler, died of lymphoma, a cancer whose return he blamed on the stress of his father’s crimes, having previously been in remission. Another on-screen account of Madoff is being released, this time with Robert De Niro as Madoff and Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife. The film, “The Wizard of Lies,” premiered May 20 on HBO. As reported by the Hollywood Reporter, De Niro didn’t attempt to meet Madoff to inform his performance. “I always want to meet the person that I’m playing, but I felt, in this case, I was a little wary,” De Niro said, adding he that he was concerned “that that would be a mixed message, that I was endorsing him.” “Bernie thinks he’s come full circle,” Fishman said. “He started as a struggling guy, and now he’s back to making his own bed and ironing his own khakis. His health isn’t great, but he’s a survivor.” ABC News reported last year that Madoff had a “little bit of a heart problem,” citing his lawyer, Ira Sorkin. ",Madoff’s closest prison chum?

When co-founder and Chief Executive Reed Hastings joined Apple’s Steve Jobs on stage to introduce Netflix’s first iOS app at the iPhone 4 introduction in 2010, the company’s streaming service was still free for DVD-by-mail subscribers, offering a fast-growing stable of shows and movies. Adoption by a generation of Apple’s mobile users proved a tipping point: More viewers accessed Netflix content through the streaming service than through the mail for the first time that year. Don’t miss:  My dad talked me out of buying Netflix, but he wasn’t wrong “Going forward, we expect we will be primarily a global streaming business, with the added feature of DVDs-by-mail in the U.S.,” the company said in its annual report in early 2011. “We believe delivery of entertainment video over the Internet will be a very large global market opportunity, and that our focus on one segment of that market—consumer-paid, commercial-free streaming subscription of TV shows and movies—will enable us to continue to grow rapidly and profitably.” Netflix was right. The market shifted quickly toward commercial-free streaming services with monthly subscriptions from pay-per-download services like Apple’s iTunes (and the illegal downloading that was rampant). Netflix was becoming a sudden force in content delivery and on Wall Street. Then, Hastings almost destroyed it all. On July 12, 2011, Netflix issued one of the most infamous press releases of the era, headlined “Netflix to Offer New Unlimited DVD Plans and Will Separate Streaming and DVD Plans in the U.S.” In the ultimate example of burying the unpleasant lead, Netflix had turned a $9.99 monthly subscription into two $7.99 subscriptions, without proper notice to consumers to cushion the blow. Justice was swift on social media, where most of Netflix’s customers found out about the price increase. Hastings apologized somewhat after the backlash, but saved his real mea culpa for a couple months later. “I messed up,” Hastings admitted in a blog post. But Hastings didn’t stop there. He also announced that Netflix would spin off its DVD-by-mail service into a new company called Qwikster, which would split the content queues Netflix users had meticulously crafted. After the price hike and more outcry from customers, Netflix’s subscriber count actually declined amid an apparent consumer backlash. Investors also booed the company, as Netflix’s stock fell 19% the day after Hastings’s Qwikster post, and 35% in a single session after Netflix revealed subscriber numbers in October. Netflix ended up erasing more than three-quarters of its market value—and becoming the butt of jokes nationwide. Qwikster never actually materialized, as Netflix killed that idea within a month and continues to operate its Netflix-branded DVD-by-mail service, with somewhere close to 4 million customers still getting those distinctive red envelopes. The Netflix streaming service, though, took off just as Hastings had predicted throughout the monthslong Qwikster debacle. Streaming worked thanks to a push that Netflix revealed that year in a less-noticed blog post. Read also: Netflix rethinks its Hollywood ambitions Months before Hastings posted his Qwikster confession, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos announced on the same forum that Netflix had landed a deal for “the first exclusive TV series to originate on Netflix.” By the time “House of Cards” debuted in 2013, Netflix had 33.3 million streaming subscribers, all in North America, and its stock had almost recovered from the debacle of 2011. Since then, Netflix has taken off creatively and quantitatively. The company has spent billions of dollars on premium original content like “House of Cards” to bolster its streaming service, winning awards and buzz.

It’s a spooky picture — and people just can’t get enough of it. Trump is shown with his face aglow in the light of the orb — actually an illuminated globe — alongside Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, at the opening of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology on Sunday. The hands-clutching-the-world pose was meant to represent solidarity at the end of a summit in Riyadh, according to reports. But what it called to mind for people on social media was movie and comic book villains, with some conspiracy theories — serious and clearly tongue-in-cheek — tossed in for good measure: This is exactly how I picture a Super Villain convention #orb #globe #news #trump #SaudiaArabia #PhotoOfTheNight #photooftheday #meme #yuge pic.twitter.com/k37Y2yx52y I'm calling tonight for a total and complete shutdown of the Trump presidency until we can figure out what the hell is going on pic.twitter.com/4K7WwmGlwO Trump During the Campaign: ""I will NEVER touch The Orb, even though its mysterious glow seduces and beguiles.""Trump Today: pic.twitter.com/eWoaDeXj8n I am gone from Twitter for like a few hours, and now Trump is a holding a Palantír!

It will use experts who specialize in confronting extremist speech, and the center is up to speed on the dialects and languages these use, according to a tweeted explanation from @riyadhsummit. Even so, for some it was the icing on the cake of a weekend that also included a traditional ardha sword dance on Saturday involving Trump, some of his staff and a throng of Saudi men.

Chris Dannen, founder of New York-based cryptoasset fund Iterative Instinct, said earlier this month that some of the recent run-up could have been caused by a handful of wealthy traders, awash in crytocurrency and moving prices to their advantage. Manfred Hubner, chief executive officer at Sentix.de, which provides a weekly capital market survey on hundreds of different indexes, said there has been a systematic increase in interest the bitcoin market since 2014, but noted a change in expectations recently, which could trigger those prices to correct, or move lower. In a note on Sentix’s website, Hubner likened bitcoin to the Dutch tulip bubble of the 17th century (it isn’t the first time such a comparison has been made), as well as a Ponzi -like scheme. He said investors should be cautious as bad things tend to happen to those who get in late on what he described as a “speculative bubble.” There are some pretty “heady valuations” out there at the moment, when it comes to bitcoin, Charles Hayter, chief executive officer and founder of Cryptocompare, said in a Monday note. “At the moment all you need to be showered in cash are a couple of buzzwords tagged onto something crypto or blockchain related. Ironic is the fact that some prediction markets who have raised via this method rely on the wisdom of crowds for their USP (unique selling point) yet are subject to their madness in terms of valuation,” he added.

During an interview at the Code Conference in Ranch Palos Verdes, California hosted by Recode, the CEO said Time Warner doesn’t have a direct connection with viewers of its shows because they are distributed via cable providers, which puts it at a disadvantage to internet companies.  AT&T has that direct line to customers, which was one of the reasons for the deal. “It’s hard to get on equal footing with them,” Bewkes said during the interview. Combining with one of the leading wireless carriers in the U.S would put the media company in a better position, or at the very least give it the foundation to take on the advertising juggernauts, he said. (See more: HBO to Remove Shows From Amazon Streaming by End of 2018) But it’s not only the internet companies’ ability to work directly with its customers that gives them an edge. Bewkes also argued that net neutrality favors Internet firms at the expense of others, which is another reason it needs AT&T. ""You have the FCC putting regulations on cable and telco companies, you have the FTC putting regulations on Facebook that are much more lax. I'd like to see it be even,"" Bewkes said according to a CNBC report. ""We're increasingly competing with West Coast global businesses that want to get in the video business.” Time Warner may not have to wait too long for relief at least on the regulatory front. President Donald Trump’s appointment to head the FCC, Ajit Pai, is opposed to net neutrality, a principle that telecom providers should allow equal bandwidth access to established companies and startups alike, and has vowed to overhaul it. (See more: FCC Chairman Fires Opening Salvo Against Net Neutrality) Ahead of last year's U.S. presidential election, Time Warner agreed to sell itself to AT&T in the multi-billion dollar deal that gives the telecom giant access to a slew of content including shows from CNN, HBO and Comedy Central. The wireless carrier wants to use Time Warner’s programming for its over-the-top streaming service DirecTV Now which competes against the likes of YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, and more recently, Facebook and Twitter (TWTR). With the number of consumers opting to cut the cord and stream their shows online growing, social media companies have been racing to own that market. Twitter has inked deals with a slew of sports and media companies while Facebook is on the lookout for original content and is reportedly paying up to get it. According to Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker’s state of the Internet report, Facebook and Google control 85% of the online advertising dollars, an area Time Warner wants more of. In order to get that it needs to collect an increased amount of data on who is watching its shows, said the executive.

At Recode's Code Conference event in California, Rubin, who left Google in 2014 to start his own venture capital firm Playground, reentered the spotlight to show off his latest invention: a $699 smartphone that runs on, what else, Android operating system. The phone, which is only 0.3 inches thick, weighs 0.4 pounds and features a huge edge-to-edge screen, is being billed as a potential direct competitor to industry titans Samsung (SSNLF) and Apple (AAPL). Other notable features include a titanium and ceramic exterior, which Essential says makes it stronger than Apple or Samsung's phones, 128 gigabytes of storage, 4GB of RAM and a front and back camera, capable of taking eight- and 13-megapixel resolution photos and 4K video, respectively. The phone, which is available in black moon, stellar gray, pure white and ocean depths colors, will also feature a magnetic connector, wireless data transfer capabilities and a tiny 360-degree camera, which, when attached to the device, can be rotated by touching the screen. Tech website TechCrunch said the phone looks ""stunning."" Rubin’s first Essential product will ship in 30 days and initially only be sold online, although, according to Recode, the new smartphone will eventually be made available to buy in some stores. Jason Keats, the company’s head of product architecture, told Wired.com that the firm doesn’t expect to sell millions of units, viewing the device as a high-end product rather than a commoditized gadget. These admissions suggest that Essential is currently not looking to knock the Samsung Galaxy and Apple iPhone off the best selling charts. However, Rubin did say during the conference that there is space in the market for other big players to enter. He also added that Essential aims to be a major consumer brand. (See also: Smartphones: Huawei Closing in on Apple, Samsung.) Aside from making phones, Rubin and his team of engineers have also been busy developing a smart-home hub to rival Amazon’s (AMZN) Alexa and Google's Home. At the Code Conference, Rubin claimed that rivals in this space will fail, should they continue to stubbornly use only their own virtual assistant software. Essential is open to the idea of running Siri, Alexa or Google’s Assistant. Recode reports that Essential Home will feature a screen and run off the company’s new operating system Ambient OS.

(FB), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) now exceeds the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index, and nearly equals the London FTSE 100, according to the Financial Times. Remove all tech shares, which are up about 20%, and the year-to-date gain on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) plummeted from a robust 7.9% as of Friday to a mere 1.4%, the FT calculated as of the open of trading last Friday. (For more, see also: These 10 Stocks Are Fueling the S&P's Rise.) The FAANG stocks have done even better, with Alphabet up over 25% (both the voting Class A shares, ticker symbol GOOGL, and the nonvoting Class C shares, trading as GOOG) through Friday's close, and the other four tech behemoths each gaining more than 30%. Nonetheless, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a division of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), recently warned that ""There are nascent signs we are in the very early stages of an overshoot,"" as quoted by the FT in its May 25 story. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Reason for caution may lie in the Citi Economic Surprise Index (CESI), developed by Citigroup Inc. (C), which gauges whether actual values of key economic indicators are above or below consensus forecasts. Net positive surprises push the CESI into positive territory, and net negative surprises produce a negative value. Right now, the CESI is negative and at its lowest level since November, which the FT cites as a matter of concern for equity investors, especially owners of frothy tech shares. (For more, see also: Fed Rate Hike Bets Are Slashed on Weaker Economy and The Single Number Preventing a Trump Bull Market.) Hedge funds are investing heavily in tech shares, while Facebook, Amazon and Google all represent big positions in funds tracked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), per the FT. Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch calculates that tech-focused mutual funds were on track to record their biggest annual inflow of funds in 15 years, the FT adds. These are signs of growing momentum investing that inflates valuations to bubble-like proportions, the FT opines. (For more, see also: The Gold Rush Into Tech Is Still On.) and Why Investors Are Doubling Down on Tech Stocks.) ​More generally, growth stocks are enjoying a particularly strong run, but their rally is being led by tech stocks, primarily the FAANG five, says the FT. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Growth Index (SGX) is up 12.93% year-to-date through Friday, per S&P Dow Jones Indices, while the S&P 500 Value Index (SVX) is up only 2.25%, also per S&P Dow Jones Indices. This discrepancy is just 1 percent off from being the greatest since the Dotcom Bubble of 2000, another reason to worry according to the FT. ""Citi says it's best not to get carried away by Citi's Surprise Index,"" reads the title of an earlier FT article. This May 8 piece quotes a Citigroup statement that ""The Citi Economic Surprise Index is a perfect example of unique proprietary design which has almost no bearing on those who discuss it...The models were built by quantitative analysts in Citi's FX unit and were structured for currency trading...It was not meant to be used for stock prices."" As far as the recent decline in the U.S. CESI goes, Citigroup said that ""it was near a five-year high six-to-seven weeks ago and was vulnerable to a pullback."" Meanwhile, despite its overall bearish outlook, the initially-cited FT article mentions that the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector is trading at a ""reasonable"" multiple of forward earnings, and admits that ""there is little on the horizon to dent the growth of the FAANGs."" While the IT Sector forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio is 18.1, that for the entire S&P 500 is 17.3, per data from Yardeni Research, Inc. (For more, see also: Why Techs Will Fly Higher, A Technical View.)

(MSFT) is trying to bribe users in the U.K. to conduct their searches via its Bing search engine, launching a rewards program that was previously only available in the U.S. When users in the U.K. conduct internet searches with Bing, they are able to earn points that can be redeemed for a slew of different things including Xbox gift cards, Groove Music passes and Microsoft apps. Bing users get points for searching, shopping the Windows Store, Xbox Store or Microsoft Store. There are also charities that Microsoft has teamed up with in the U.K. so users can turn their accumulated points into donations. According to a report in the Verge, participants get three points per Bing search with a maximum of 30 points per day—similar to how the program works in the U.S. If they are using the Microsoft Edge browser, that doubles to 60 points each day. Extra points can be garnered by taking part in quizzes. For every pound spent at the U.K. online Microsoft Store, reward recipients gets one point. For those that reach 500 points in one month, there is a higher level of rewards and the chance to earn 150 points per day. (See also: Microsoft Studying Multilingual Speech to Humanize Cortana.) While the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant may appear generous with its program for U.K. consumers, it’s all about getting more people to use Bing to conduct searches, an area where Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google dominates in most of the world. According to Statista, in April 2017, Google accounted for 85.74% of internet searchers in the U.K. with Bing in second place at 10.07%. Yahoo was a distant third with 3.16% of searches. Microsoft plans to launch the rewards program in France, Germany and Canada in the next few weeks or months. (See also: Microsoft Targets Ed. Market With New Surface, OS.)

Mary Meeker’s latest internet trends report detailed just how dominant Amazon has become. Among the prominent venture capitalist’s most interesting findings was the revelation that the Seattle-based company now sells more batteries than Duracell and almost as many diapers as Procter & Gamble's (PG) leading brand Pampers. (See also: Amazon Hits $1000.) In her comprehensive breakdown of web habits, the analyst claimed that, as of August 2016, Amazon commanded just over 30 percent of the U.S. battery market, giving it a comfortable 10 percentage point lead over its closest rival Duracell, and ranked third in baby diapers sales with a 15 percent market share. Source: KP Internet Trends 2017 Amazon’s dominance of various niche categories reflects the growing pull of ecommerce. With an increasing number of consumers now preferring to shop online, Meeker reports that retail store closures are set to break a 20-year record. Source: KP Internet Trends 2017 Online retail sales in the U.S. grew 15 percent from 2015 to 2016, as package and parcel volumes surged 9 percent year-over-year. Those figures, and the revelation that an increasing number of companies are closing down brick-and-mortar stores, came as Amazon opened a book shop in New York and a grocery store in its native Seattle. Meeker also confirmed that Amazon’s Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud market. AWS is reportedly being used by 57 percent of IT professionals in 2017, representing the same level registered the previous year. However, the report added that Microsoft (MSFT) and Google  (GOOG) currently own 34 percent and 15 percent of the market, respectively, growing their share as an increasing number of customers choose to reduce their dependence on just one provider. Other big takeaways from the 355 slide opus included the forecast that internet advertising spend will overtake television advertising spending in the next six months. The report added that 85 percent of new online advertising dollars now go to Google and Facebook (FB). (See also: Google, Facebook Dominate Digital Ads in 2017.) Other notable insights included the continued slump in smartphone sales, Spotify earning 20 percent of the global music industry’s revenue and the fact that wearables are now worn by about a quarter of Americans. Meeker believes the growing success of wearables will mostly benefit Google. She also added that 20 percent of queries on the Mountain View-based company’s search platform are now made using voice, rather than text.

Mark Kolakowski,06012017,Investopedia,05252017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) hit the magic price of $1,000 per share on the morning of May 30, but there's no indication that CEO Jeff Bezos has any intention of splitting the stock, the Wall Street Journal reports. To the contrary, letting your company's shares soar to such a dizzying price is ""a new way of calling attention to yourself,"" as finance professor William C. Weld of the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School told the Journal. For this, and other reasons, stock splits are becoming increasingly rare. In the case of Amazon, a stock price above $1,000 is a way of signaling the company's dominance. The company now accounts for nearly 9% of all general merchandise sales in the U.S. except food, gasoline, autos and restaurant meals, according to data presented by Barron's. And that astonishing percentage is growing. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Moreover, by not splitting its shares, Amazon theoretically presents past and future investors with an unchanging yardstick against which to measure returns. Amazon shares, which closed Friday at $995.78, now trade at 14.3 times their closing price of $69.63 on May 29, 2007, just a decade ago. The stock reached an intraday high of $999.00 on Thursday. (For more, see: How Home Depot, Best Buy, Wal-Mart Can Beat Amazon.) Amazon split its shares three times while it was a young public company, the Journal says. During the company's annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday May 23, Bezos was asked about the possibility of a split, to make Amazon shares more affordable to middle class and young investors. ""We don't have any plans to do this at this point, but we'll continue to look at that,"" was his noncommittal response as quoted by the Journal. Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. saw its Class A Shares (GOOGL) close Friday at $993.27, while its Class C Shares (GOOG) closed at $971.47. Considerably less media attention is devoted to insurer Markel Corp. (MKL) at $967.57. Already well beyond the $1,000 barrier are Class A shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A), which closed Friday at a breathtaking $248,524.00 each. The others are agribusiness company Seaboard Corp. (SEB) at $3,994.05, homebuilder NVR Inc. (NVR) at $2,285.63 and travel booking company The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN) at $1,863.90. A recent article in MarketWatch discusses the 15 highest priced stocks. In 2016, only six companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) split their shares, versus 93 companies 20 years ago, and the tally so far in 2017 is only two, per data from Birinyi Associates cited by the Journal. Today the average S&P 500 stock trades above $98 per share, up from a range of $25 to $50 that lasted for decades, per the same sources. These figures are not adjusted for inflation, however. In any case, with more individuals investing through vehicles such as mutual funds and hedge funds, rather than via direct purchases of specific stocks, this is another reason for the increasing irrelevance of stock prices and stock splits. Institutional investors, meanwhile, dislike stock splits insofar as they pay brokerage commissions on a per-share basis, the Journal observes. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has been a longtime critic of stock splits, the Journal reports. However, even Buffett has found an occasional sound business reason for a split. Class B shares in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), which closed Friday at $165.69, were split 50 to one in 2010 to facilitate the buyout of small shareholders in railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. Back when individual investors largely built their own equity portfolios, rather than through investment funds, there was an economic imperative to buy in round lots of 100 shares. Transaction costs were proportionally higher for odd lots of less than 100 shares, with an odd lot differential, typically an extra 1/8 point (12.5 cents) per share, charged in addition to regular commissions. Public companies saw an imperative to keep the price of a round lot within the reach of small investors, and thus split their shares when the price rose to significant heights. Splits themselves used to spur a slight increase in price, as buying interest increased once a round lot became less expensive. Today investors pay commissions as little as $10 per trade, and can buy or sell a single share without added charges, the Journal notes. Odd lot differentials are a thing of the past. ","Amazon Nearing $1,000 Signals End of Stock Splits (AMZN, GOOGL, MKL) | Investopedia"
Todd Shriber,06012017,Investopedia,05252017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With the Nasdaq Composite soaring to record heights and the technology sector ranking as this year's best-performing group, it is not surprising that many investors are evaluating technology and Nasdaq-related exchange traded funds (ETFs). While multiple ETFs offer exposure to Nasdaq indexes, the PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) is the king of that group. The $52.2 billion QQQ is over 18 years old and is one of the largest plain vanilla ETFs in the U.S. QQQ tracks the widely followed Nasdaq-100 Index, a benchmark that holds famed technology and internet stocks such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), among others. Due in part to QQQ's popularity, issuers of leveraged ETFs tapped traders' thirst for more exotic ways to play the Nasdaq-100. That includes the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ). TQQQ's objective is simple: To deliver triple the daily returns of Nasdaq-100. So if that index rises by 1% on a particular day, TQQQ should jump by 3%. Among leveraged ETFs, TQQQ is one of the largest with assets under management of $1.34 billion at the end of the first quarter. TQQQ is also one of the more heavily traded leveraged ETFs in the U.S. with average daily volume of 2.55 million shares. Deciding between QQQ and TQQQ is not a difficult task. It merely requires some self-awareness on behalf of the trader. TQQQ, as is the case with any leveraged ETF, is an instrument best used over intraday time frames, not as a buy-and-hold investment. Investors and traders that do not consider themselves “active” and “risk-tolerant” should eschew leveraged ETFs. “Due to the compounding of daily returns, ProShares' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the target return for the same period. These effects may be more pronounced in funds with larger or inverse multiples and in funds with volatile benchmarks,” according to ProShares, the largest issuer of leveraged ETFs. On the other hand, QQQ checks many of the boxes long-term investors look for in broad market ETFs. The ETF offers liquid, cost-efficient exposure to a tech-heavy basket of large-cap, innovative companies without burdening investors with stock-picking or the commitment of a technology-specific ETF. Tech stocks account for 58.5% of QQQ's weight with consumer discretionary and healthcare names representing another third of the ETF's roster. While the Nasdaq-100 is historically more volatile than the S&P 500, QQQ can be held over long time frames while TQQQ is definitely a short-term trade.

(AMZN) poked through the vaunted $1,000 price level before closing just below there. It appears to be just a matter of time before shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) do the same thing. With these storied internet stocks surging and sporting price tags that are unapproachable to most investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) make for solid alternatives to high-priced stocks for capital-starved investors. A good starting point is the PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), the Nasdaq-100 Index tracking ETF. As of May 26, Amazon was QQQ's third largest holding at a weight of just 7 percent, while both classes of Alphabet stock combined for almost 10 percent of the fund's weight. The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN), a stock with a staggering price tag of just under $1,860 as of Tuesday's close, is 1.4 percent of QQQ's lineup. In other words, QQQ is a fine idea for investors looking for exposure to high-priced stocks. Based on sheer price, QQQ is not ""cheap"" at over $141 per share, but that is more feasible for many retail investors than the stratospheric heights at which Alphabet, Amazon and Priceline reside. (See also: Amazon's Shares Cross $1,000 Mark.) ""We saw some late week reversals in QQQ in terms of outflows turning into inflows, as the fund has reeled in over $1.3 billion via creations lately,"" said Paul Weisbruch of Street One Financial in a note out Tuesday. ""It does not hurt that number three weighting Amazon is trading at a new all-time high today and has eclipsed $1,000 for the first time ever before regressing a bit and other top weighted members are all within shouting distance of their 52-week highs."" Over the past year, investors have added more than $5 billion in new assets to QQQ, more than the inflows accrued to any other PowerShares ETF, according to issuer data. During the past month, QQQ has seen inflows of $1.1 billion, also more than any other PowerShares ETF. QQQ holds 107 stocks with an average market capitalization of $275.5 billion. Since QQQ came to market in March 1999, the ETF has topped the Russell 3000 Index and the Nasdaq Composite, a broader measure of Nasdaq stocks, according to PowerShares data.

Chevron's dividend yield was 4.15% as of May 13, while the yield of Occidental Petroleum surpassed 5%, Google Finance data showed. The yield of Exxon Mobil, however, failed to surpass 4%, reaching 3.8%. While many of these companies have struggled over the last few years, their situation has improved as of late, Barron's reported. In addition, major oil firms have managed their expenses effectively, making it easier for them to bolster dividend payments, Norman MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco Energy Fund, told Barron's. (For more, see also: What Determines Oil Prices?) Larger oil companies, such as Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum, ""have massively adjusted their cost bases in a low-commodity environment,"" he told Barron's. Using this approach has permitted them to ""make sure they can make that dividend [payment] and actually grow it."" However, cost reductions have also watered down investments in future production, which provide industry participants with revenue and profits further down the line.  While the dividends of oil companies have been improving lately, oil prices will need to climb before dividends recover to historical levels, Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research, told Investor's Business Daily. ""Energy earnings are very highly correlated to energy prices,"" she emphasized. At the time of report, oil prices were close to $50, with July Brent trading slightly above this level on London's ICE Futures exchange and light, sweet crude futures scheduled for delivery in July trading less than 5% below it on New York Mercantile Exchange, according to MarketWatch.

The mobile app is being tested in Japan with an Android-only version and includes six islands, 52 stages and 134 different Pokémon, reported Kotaku. Players in the alpha test group are able to move to the 15th floor. The testing is running through June 9 in Japan, noted the gaming news site. Not to leave augmented reality behind, game players will be able to collect and train creatures. In order to play, users need an internet connection and a Nintendo account. The Japanese game maker hasn’t said when it will be rolled out on an international basis. (See also: How Pokemon Go Uses Augmented Reality.) Ever since Pokémon Go became a huge hit, Nintendo has been capitalizing on all the hype by launching different editions of the game. The augmented reality gaming app requires players to explore their surroundings and “catch” Pokémon characters on their smartphone screens. It is free and offers in-app purchases. The game was developed by the Pokémon Company, in which Nintendo owns a 33% minority stake, and Niantic Inc., a startup with backing from Google. The Japan-based company made a huge amount of money off of the in-app purchases and is likely to try to follow suit with Pokéland. (See also: Nintendo Doubles Down On Mobile Gaming.)

Todd Haselton,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Google has confirmed it's getting into the ad-blocking game, as has been previously reported — but in a very limited way. The company told CNBC that it will allow publishers to participate in a new program called Funding Choices. Under the program, when a user with a third-party ad blocker enabled visits a participating site using Chrome, they will see a prompt that asks them to either turn off their ad blocker, or ""pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor."" If they choose to pay the fee, Google will take a 10 percent cut. If they select neither choice, they won't be able to view the website. The move will help publishers who fear losing ad revenue from users with ad blockers turned on. Instead of having to manage these kinds of prompts themselves, publishers can essentially outsource this task to Google. To see the prompts, users must sign up to participate in the Google Contributor program, and must be signed in to Chrome. If they're not signed up and have an ad-blocker turned on, they won't be able to view the site. If they're not using an ad blocker at all, they'll be able to view the site as usual, complete with ads. Business Insider is among the participating sites, Google confirmed. However, publishers must first be compliant with ad standards from the Coalition of Better Ads, of which Google is a part, which could hurt some smaller publishers who have limited leverage over the types of ads they can accept. Publishers will be able to prepare their sites for these standards using an Ad Experience Report, which will provide ""screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences we've identified to make it easy to find and fix the issues."" Pop-ups, takeover ads and ads with auto-playing audio are all considered bad ads, according to the Coalition for Better Ads. Google confirmed a new version of Chrome will launch in 2018 that will prevent websites from showing ads ""including those owned or served by Google"" on sites that don't meet its standards.

The new effort shows Google taking its experience with venture capital and applying it to AI, a type of computing that it has been increasingly using across its applications. The new organization will be separate from Google parent company Alphabet's funding activity within GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), Axios reported on Friday. Google itself has also made venture investments on its own. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in the past year has started positioning the company as being ""AI first"" as opposed to being ""mobile first."" Having an investment group focusing on that does make sense given that thesis. Google has dedicated AI research groups including DeepMind, whose AlphaGo AI Go player earlier this week beat the top human Go player, Ke Jie. Google uses AI in its search engine, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, and Google Translate, among other things. Startups who take on funding from the new group can receive mentorship, as well as services and space to operate, Axios said. AI startups have many places to go to for money, including other corporate venture arms and institutional venture capital firms. But having backing from the new group could provide a particular mark of legitimacy at a time when so many startups today claim to be using AI. Google declined to comment.

""The most valuable thing you can have as a leader is clear data,"" Porat said Wednesday, in describing her role at the company. The comment, made during an onstage interview at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, helps explain why Porat, a former executive with the buttoned-up Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley, has been a good fit at a Silicon Valley giant known for its informal ways. ""I was quoting Eric's book before I joined Google,"" Porat said, referring to a book written by Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. Porat laughed when her interviewer, Recode executive editor Kara Swisher, suggested that some at Alphabet refer to her as ""Ruth Vader,"" because of her reputation as a cost-cutter. ""Fantastic. That's fantastic,"" Porat said, with obvious sarcasm. Contrary to that conventional wisdom, she said she spends more time focused on the investment side of Alphabet's business than on the expense side. ""We're not just focused on expenses, but on what makes us great, [which is] innovation,"" Porat said. Alphabet's top execs make weekly evaluations of its most advanced technologies, which the company refers to as Other Bets. The question that she, Brin and Page spend the most time on is, ""What are the bets that will help us grow?""

""Those decisions can't come from the CFO. They have to come from the business leaders. The best thing I can do is give them accurate data. It's really about the data,"" Porat said.

You probably wouldn't expect to have to interview yourself. In a recent interview with Business Insider, AOL CEO and former Google exec Tim Armstrong described the unusual interviewing tactic used by Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. ""I don't think I've ever told this story,"" Armstrong says. ""But when I had my first discussion with them, they basically said at the beginning of the meeting, after a few questions, 'We're not really sure what to ask you. Ask yourself the questions. ""'Like, what questions would you ask yourself, if you were us?'"" In other words, Page and Brin asked Armstrong to interview himself in front of them. ""So I said, 'Look, I'm a very direct person, very honest. Here's what I would ask, the following questions,'"" he recalls. ""I thought that was interesting,"" Armstrong says about the unorthodox interview. Over the next decade, Armstrong became an important player in Google's exponential growth, including spearheading the company's AdSense division. After holding multiple C-level positions, he left the company in 2009 to lead AOL. Armstrong wasn't the only one the Google co-founders used this tactic on. ""I realized later, after working with them, that that was not an anomaly,"" he said. ""That was one of their tactics."" Google has long held a reputation for its difficult interviews. In the past, candidates had to wrangle with brainteaser questions such as, ""How many times a day does a clock's hands overlap?"" and, ""Estimate how many gas stations there are in Manhattan.""

John Shinal,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Wednesday that existing U.S. regulations covering internet content unfairly favor Facebook and Google and that his company agreed to be acquired by AT&T to better compete with those technology giants. ""You have the FCC putting regulations on cable and telco companies, you have the FTC putting regulations on Facebook that are much more lax. I'd like to see it be even,"" Bewkes said in response to a question about so-called Net Neutrality rules during an onstage interview at the Code Conference in Ranch Palos Verdes, California. Time Warner last year agreed to be acquired by AT&T for $85 billion in a deal that will provide the wireless giant with a stable of news and entertainment content while giving Time Warner new ways of distributing its shows. AT&T will also get valuable data on its end users, which Bewkes says it needs to better compete for advertising dollars amid stiffer competition from the tech industry. ""We're increasingly competing with West Coast global businesses that want to get in the video business,"" Bewkes told the gathering of tech executives. Google's YouTube unit now hosts one billion hours of video viewing per day, CEO Sundar Pichai told Wall Street analysts in April, during a conference call to discuss the first-quarter earnings of its parent company, Alphabet. Facebook is also making a bigger push into video and is reportedly getting ready to roll out its own original shows sometime in June. Those two Silicon Valley giants accounted for 85 percent of the growth in digital advertising spending last year, according to an annual report on the Internet presented at the conference earlier Wednesday from Mary Meeker, a partner with venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. To garner a bigger chunk of that growth, Time Warner needs better data on those who watch its networks, including CNN, HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central. ""We're trying to get more data, to compete more effectively with a much bigger set of data that the digital companies have,"" Bewkes said. The mega-merger, which Bewkes said is ""good for America,"" is expected to close this year after FCC Chair Ajit Pai said in February the agency doesn't expect to review it. Cable and telecom companies, including AT&T, have in the past argued against the net neutrality rules enacted two years ago under former FCC chair Tom Wheeler, saying that they unfairly favor firms that use lots of network traffic. Those rules prevent internet service providers from favoring or discriminating against network traffic from any particular provider, such as Google, Facebook or Netflix. Industry watchers widely expect those rules to be undone by the FCC, which now has a Republican majority. ","Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes: Net regulations favor Google, Facebook"

""Some jobs are displaced, but equally new jobs are also created each time a new technology comes along,"" Dave Silver, a lead programmer of a powerful Google computer, AlphaGo, told CNBC. ""There will be big change … but it's something I'm optimistic will actually lead to more opportunities, rather than less.""  Google has made a big push with artificial intelligence, with its machine, AlphaGo, as the most visible success thus far. The computer has already beat twice this week Ke Jie, a 19 year old and the world's best player of Go, an ancient Chinese board game. Teaching computers to master the game has long been considered a holy grail for scientists given the complexity – there are more possible configurations of the board than atoms in the universe. And AlphaGo's ability to beat the best human masters is something that happened about a decade sooner than experts anticipated. Given these rapid advancements, the tech firm is now looking to apply AI to a range of fields. Image recognition, for instance, can be used for diagnosing medical conditions, said Lily Peng, a trained doctor leading the tech firm's efforts in finding health applications.  Such technology can help physicians cut down the ""time crunching through data,"" Peng told CNBC. Then doctors can spend far more time ""taking care of the patients … [and] understanding what they want to tailor the best treatment for them."" When it comes to finance, HSBC has even taken on Google services to fight money laundering and better calculate risk, said Jia Li, head of R&D for machine learning and artificial intelligence at Google. The bank can now generate certain financial reports in six minutes – much faster than the six hours it previously took.  ""We're most excited about applying AI to science and medicine … using AI as a tool to improve scientific breakthroughs,"" Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, told CNBC. ""And also to improve healthcare and maybe eventually help with finding cures for diseases or medical diagnostics.""

Anita Balakrishnan,06012017,CNBC,05252017,"Waze's carpooling service will expand to all of California next week, the company announced Wednesday. The expansion of Waze Carpool, which begins Tuesday, provides another option for California's tech-savvy commuters, and could ramp up competition for transportation technology start-ups like Uber and Lyft. Waze's app allows commuters to input traffic hazards and slowdowns and see a crowd-sourced map of commuting delays. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, bought Israeli-developed Waze in 2013, integrating Google's extensive mapping and geolocation services into the app. More recently, the traffic-tracking social app has been running pilots of a service that allows users to pick up passengers along a planned route in Israel and several California communities. Alphabet is ""very happy"" with how the pilots went, said Josh Fried, head of Waze Carpool. He said the San Francisco pilot is growing every week, though he declined to share specific numbers, citing the competitive atmosphere. Unlike ride-hailing services, Waze Carpool caps payments, and drivers are limited to two rides a day. That way, the company said, drivers will be reimbursed for the wear-and-tear on their car, but will not use the carpooling app as a full-time gig. Drivers get a maximum rate of 54 cents per mile on Waze Carpool — the IRS limit that differentiates income and reimbursement for gas mileage and wear-and-tear — meaning drivers shouldn't have to declare the rides as a source of income on their taxes. Still, for such a small payment, taking a detour to pick up a stranger may seem like an unlikely scenario. But Fried said Waze's community differentiates it from ride-hailing services that can provide higher payments and fast service. Users can vet the drivers on social media, and even use Waze Carpool as a networking opportunity for those who live nearby, Fried said, not unlike the way Airbnb promises the opportunity not just for cheap accommodations, but to build a relationship with a local. Through the pilot programs, Waze has learned how to optimize waiting times and driving times for both parties to make sure it's convenient, Fried said. ""Carpool for us is a really big bet,"" Fried said. ""It embodies what we think makes the best of Waze: our innovative technology, our expertise in complex routing and our friendly community that's in it to help each other out. For years, folks on the Waze platform have helped each other out by contributing to data. Now they are able to really take a sizable step in reducing congestion by taking cars off the road."" It's yet another in a series of moves by Alphabet, which has invested in both Uber and Lyft, to build a burgeoning transportation empire. Fried even said that Waze benefits from ""friends in the ride-hailing industry"" that have gotten people comfortable with seeing cars pick them up on a screen. Alphabet has also invested heavily in self-driving car technologies through its Waymo arm, which according to datahas a sizable lead over rivals like Uber and Tesla in that arena. ""Google has always been known for taking multiple bets in the same category — like messaging,"" Fried said. ""The key is, we are all focused on our individual users and what they need.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases. ","

She joined the agency in 2012 and became interim director in 2013 before being formerly nominated as director by then-President Barack Obama in 2014. Some inventors and patent licensing companies had opposed Lee, who was previously an in-house lawyer for Alphabet Inc’s Google. The patent office is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce that reviews applications for patents and trademarks. The agency is also empowered to cancel patents it has issued. Lee has been viewed favorably by the technology industry for ushering in more stringent standards for software patents. More than 50 companies, including Facebook Inc and Cisco Systems Inc, sent a letter to President Donald Trump and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in April urging them to retain Lee as director of the patent office. The companies said in the letter that Lee’s efforts at the patent office had led to a decrease in abusive litigation filed by so-called “patent trolls.” The Trump administration has yet to put forth a nominee for the position, which required Senate confirmation.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"In the wake of the deadly Islamist-inspired attacks in Europe over the past two years, tech companies have come under increased pressure to do more to help police investigations, and law enforcement officials have bemoaned the slow process required to access data stored in the cloud in other EU member states. The European Commission will present three options to EU ministers which will form the basis of a future legislative proposal, including the possibility for police to copy data directly from the cloud, EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told Reuters on Wednesday. “I am sure that now in the shadow of the recent terrorist attacks and increasing threats in Europe there will be more understanding among the ministers, even among those who come from countries where there has not been a terrorist attack,” she said. EU justice ministers meet in Luxembourg on Thursday and will discuss the Commission’s options. Based on their preferences, the EU executive will then come forward with a proposal by the end of the year or early 2018, Jourova said. The least intrusive option involves allowing law enforcement authorities in one member state to ask an IT provider in another member state to turn over electronic evidence, without having to ask that member state first. The second option would see the companies obliged to turn over data if requested by law enforcement authorities in other member countries. As an example, police in Italy seeking electronic evidence stored in Ireland would currently have to ask the Irish authorities to retrieve the evidence for them, a process critics say is slow and cumbersome. However, many in the tech community have voiced concern about allowing governments to force companies to turn over data stored in another country, fearing it could erode customers’ privacy and make them less likely to use cloud services if they thought the data could be seized. The Commission weighed in for Microsoft in that case, saying data held by companies in the EU should not be directly accessed by foreign authorities outside formal channels of cooperation. “We urge EU legislators to pursue measures that guarantee clarity and predictability, without putting service providers in ‘conflict of law’ situations,” said Thomas Boue, director general for policy, EMEA. The most intrusive option being considered by the EU could be envisaged in situations where authorities do not know the location of the server hosting the data or there is a risk of the data being lost, Jourova said. “This third option is kind of an emergency possibility which will require some additional safeguards protecting the privacy of people,” she said. Such safeguards include requiring that law enforcement requests are necessary and proportionate. “You simply cannot massively collect some digital data for some future use,” Jourova said. The types of data that could fall within the scope of the law will also be discussed on Thursday, with options ranging from non-content data such as location or traffic data to personal communications data. “My preference is to go for this as an extraordinary measure for extraordinary threats, for high gravity criminal offences such as terrorism and there I am in favor of enabling the use of personal data,” Jourova said, adding that no decision has yet been taken.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile is looking at expanding its undersea fiber optic network across the Pacific Ocean to China and south to Patagonia, a project that has attracted interest from international companies including Amazon, the government said on Tuesday. Chile, one of Latin America’s most developed countries, is relatively well connected in telecoms terms, but existing networks will not suffice for the future, telecoms undersecretary Rodrigo Ramirez said to journalists. The domestic project will connect the settlements of remote Patagonia as far south as Puerto Williams on the tip of Cape Horn, and would be the world’s most southerly such cable, the telecoms ministry said. The contract to build it is to be awarded in September and will be subsidized to the tune of 64 billion Chilean pesos ($96 million). International companies had expressed an interest in the growth of technology infrastructure in the region, including Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, said Ramirez. Amazon is expanding its cloud business internationally and is keen to build more data centers. In March, the company signed an understanding with Chile to help modernize the country’s government systems. It has also expressed an interest in placing a data center in Patagonia, ministry technical head Sebastian Beeche told Reuters. Beeche added that President Michelle Bachelet would discuss this with company representatives during a visit to Seattle in the United States on Tuesday where Amazon has its headquarters. In South America, Amazon has data centers only in Brazil, but is keen to expand into Chile, attracted by its relative economic and political stability and the cooler climate, said Beeche. The company’s cloud-computing business is the largest in the world and accounts for a majority of its operating profit. Adding more data centers is key so it can handle an influx of new clients looking to host their data and computing in the cloud. Amazon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Chile has also been talking with China about laying fiber optic cable across the Pacific, a technically demanding challenge, said Ramirez. Such a cable would cost an estimated $550 million to $650 million and stretch for at least 20,000 kilometers (12,427 miles) across the southern Pacific, an area that to date is off the international subsea fiber optic grid. Three potential routes are being examined, the ministry said. One would run from Chile’s coast via New Zealand and Australia, another further south via just New Zealand, and a third via Tahiti. All could potentially link remote Easter Island, which is governed by Chile. The timing of construction of the trans-Pacific route and the details of the bidding process have not yet been finalized, but the government said it was hoping to make a decision this year on the route and was in discussions with China, and also with other South American countries that may benefit.

,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Car service Uber is using a gap in EU and UK tax rules to avoid incurring sales tax on the booking fees it charges drivers in Britain, a practise a senior politician said was unfair to competitors and defied the intent of the law. San Francisco-based Uber charges lower fares than rival ride hailing apps. In Britain, its competitors’ fares include 20 percent value added tax (VAT) on booking fees, but Uber’s fares do not. Uber is able to avoid VAT by exploiting a loophole in how the tax is collected for business-to-business sales across EU borders, which arises because it treats its 40,000 UK drivers as separate businesses, each too small to register for VAT. It confirmed to Reuters that it does not pay value added tax on the fees it charges British drivers. By contrast, two of its main UK rivals, Gett and mytaxi, both said they do pay VAT on their fees. They declined to comment on Uber’s practise. The loophole applies in other European countries too, but is particularly important for Uber in Britain which accounts for a third of its European business. Other EU countries have put tighter rules in place to close or narrow the loophole. Paying VAT on Uber’s fees would cost the company about 1,000 pounds a year on average for each of its UK drivers, based on information Uber has given about the size of its British business, which is growing rapidly under its expansion plans. Uber told Reuters it respected the tax rules in all the countries where it operated. Asked whether avoiding paying value added tax gave the company an unfair advantage over its rivals, a spokesman said: “The same rules apply to any international service provider with customers in the UK.” Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the UK tax authority, declined to comment on Uber, citing confidentiality rules. A spokesman said: “Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we make sure they do.” Three European tax experts consulted by Reuters said Uber’s practise probably complies with the way Britain has decided to implement EU rules. But Margaret Hodge, a member of Britain’s Labour Party who has long led parliamentary investigations into corporate tax avoidance, criticised Uber’s practise of not paying VAT on its fees, when told of it by Reuters. “It is yet another example of how large companies find loopholes and use the law for a purpose for which it was never intended,” she said. “There is a failure to pay tax that should be due. That reduces the money available for public services and is unfair on Uber’s competitors.” The same loophole is used by other companies such as Google and Facebook to avoid VAT on certain transactions involving small businesses, but the benefit is more important for Uber, since the fees it charges drivers are its main source of income. Even as Uber has become a transportation powerhouse around the world, opponents, including established taxi operators, have mounted legal and public relations attacks on the Silicon Valley company, saying it owes its success to bending the rules. Several high level executives have left Uber in recent months, and its CEO was forced to apologise after being filmed haranguing one of its drivers. It has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate its corporate culture, including accusations of sexual harassment. In Europe, the lead advocate to the European Court of Justice concluded in May that Uber is a transportation service, not an information platform, and therefore open to far greater regulation. In the United States it also faces a Justice Department criminal investigation into software used to prevent law enforcement officials from hailing Uber cars, to shield the company from regulators. Despite those troubles, Uber has been growing rapidly, rolling out its service in new cities month by month. Uber avoids having to charge British value added tax on its booking fees by treating each driver as an individual business and then billing drivers across EU borders from its Dutch subsidiary, using an EU VAT provision called the “reverse charge”. The rule lets businesses sell goods or services to other businesses across EU borders without paying VAT. There is usually no loss of tax revenue, because the importing business collects VAT from its own customers. But since Uber drivers mostly generate less than the 85,000 pounds a year sales threshold to register for VAT in Britain, they don’t have to collect it. Gett and mytaxi both bill their drivers from companies within Britain. As the reverse charge does not apply to domestic sales, that means that unlike Uber they must charge drivers VAT. Uber is not the only big American firm to use EU reverse charge rules to reduce the VAT tab when billing small business clients across EU borders. Google and Facebook use the same approach when selling from their Irish regional headquarters. That means British plumbers or guesthouse owners who are not registered for VAT can buy advertisements from Google or Facebook without being charged the tax, even though they would pay it when placing an advertisement in a local newspaper. The EU’s reverse charge regime was intended to cut paperwork required to distribute VAT revenue among EU countries by placing the responsibility for collecting it on the importing country. It was not intended to allow companies to escape VAT altogether, said Laurent Lattmann, a VAT partner with advisory Taxand in Zurich. “A supplier should not use the reverse charge if they are selling to a customer without a VAT registration,” Lattmann said. Other EU countries often have lower sales thresholds to register for VAT, and several have systems in place to ensure that buyers that are not VAT-registered pay the missing tax when they import goods or services VAT-free across EU borders. Germany has imposed a requirement on non-VAT registered businesses to complete a special form and pay the tax when they import reverse-charged goods or services, said Barbara Fleckenstein-Weiland, tax lawyer with Flick Gocke Schaumburg in Frankfurt. Erwin Boumans, Brussels-based tax partner at accountants BDO said Belgium had a similar system. “The cultural attitude of tax authorities is very different from country to country. The UK has historically taken a light touch approach,” said Nicholas Hallam, Chief Executive of UK VAT advisory Accordance. Uber is privately-held and does not publish accounts, but says it has more than 40,000 drivers in Britain who each bring in an average of around 560 pounds a week in gross fares. It normally charges fees of 20-25 percent of the fare. That suggests the company is collecting more than 200 million pounds a year in fees on more than 1 billion in UK fares, and saving at least 40 million by not paying VAT. Uber declined to comment when presented with those calculations. If Uber were forced to pay VAT on its fees and tried to pass the extra cost on to drivers, many would quit, said Jason Shepherd, a London Uber driver who moved with his wife and kids into his in-laws’ house to make ends meet. “Most Uber drivers are just treading water,” he said. “If Uber put up its fees I would immediately consider other options and I’m sure most other drivers would too.” James Farrar, an Uber driver trying to organise fellow drivers into a union, said typical drivers earn only around 6 pounds an hour after car rental, insurance and other costs. “Even with surge fares, it’s less than the minimum wage” of 7.50 an hour, he said. Uber says drivers who rent their cars earn more than 8 pounds an hour on average. ","

 ,06082017,Reuters,06012017,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bosses of Australia’s media companies, including an arm of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, have formed an unprecedented front to lobby for changes they say will allow more consolidation and help them compete with internet giants. This week, in a show of unity, chief executives of companies from radio broadcasters to newspaper publishers joined Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Canberra, in a last-ditch effort to swing the upper house, controlled by recalcitrant independent lawmakers. Like rivals globally, Australia’s media companies have been squeezed by new arrivals and digital advertising. But they have also been unable to join forces or expand into markets that are  off limits because of restrictions on what assets they can own, as they battle online giants like Netflix and Google. Australia’s “two out of three” rule, which has restricted deals, does not allow one organization to own all three media in any given city - newspapers, television and radio. “The whole competitive landscape in which we operate has changed,” said Hugh Marks, chief executive officer of Nine Entertainment. “Everyone’s kind of had to accept, well, this is all for the good of the industry, as well as being good for our businesses,” he said, referring to the united front. Peter Tonagh, chief executive of News Corp’s half-owned cable TV company Foxtel, said the proposed changes “aren’t optimal for any of us”, but the industry had embraced compromise because of “what would previously have been unimaginable competition”. Yet their last-minute push, as Turnbull tries to persuade  non-government lawmakers to vote for his package of changes, is not guaranteed to succeed. The industry and government agree on the package of changes - removing caps on how many assets a single traditional media firm can own, letting cable television bid for some sports rights and cutting broadcast license fees owed by stations to the government. But they face significant opposition, including from a populist bloc in parliament that wants less funding for the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. A spokesman for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, which has four of the Senate’s 76 seats, told Reuters the group is “not convinced that the challenges facing media operators justify the abolishment of the two out of three rule”. The government has also said it will not split up the package of reforms. Still, the overhaul may come too late. Newspaper publisher Fairfax Media is considering takeover offers from two private equity firms below A$1.25 per share, a quarter of its price a decade ago. Television station Ten Network Holdings has warned it may collapse by the end of the year if it does not secure a new bank loan. “Those kinds of synergies (enabled by the changes) may be able to prolong your useful life, but is that really sustainable in the face of these little things called Google and YouTube and Facebook? I’m not sure,” said Brian Han, a Morningstar analyst. Australian advertising spending is increasing more than 6 percent a year, twice as fast as the economy, and is forecast to reach $12 billion this year. Yet most of the growth is seen going into online advertising, while print, radio and television advertising is either flat or down. Since 2015, Australian traditional media companies have written down the value of their assets by $4 billion in total, according to Thomson Reuters data. A spokeswoman for Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said he still hoped to win over crossbenchers. For graphic on Australia's media moguls, click: tmsnrt.rs/2rxR4aB ","

The announcement was made on its official blog yesterday, and publishers have even been provided with a new tool called “Ad Experience Reports” to help better prepare for its introduction. This tool will give publishers the opportunity to determine which ads are deemed offensive on their websites, so that they can iron out any potential issues before Google’s ad blocker goes live. The filter, as Google is calling it, is expected to be switched on by default in desktop and mobile versions of Chrome in a bid to weed out ads that hinder user web-surfing experiences. Rather than block all unsuitable looking ads, the tool will focus specifically on webpages where annoying or intrusive commercial messages, including auto-playing large videos, pop up regularly. Google, which makes nearly 89 percent of its revenues from displaying ads and, together with Facebook (FB) accounted for 85 percent of internet ad spending growth last year.

During an interview at the Code Conference in Ranch Palos Verdes, California hosted by Recode, the CEO said Time Warner doesn’t have a direct connection with viewers of its shows because they are distributed via cable providers, which puts it at a disadvantage to internet companies.  AT&T has that direct line to customers, which was one of the reasons for the deal. “It’s hard to get on equal footing with them,” Bewkes said during the interview. Combining with one of the leading wireless carriers in the U.S would put the media company in a better position, or at the very least give it the foundation to take on the advertising juggernauts, he said. (See more: HBO to Remove Shows From Amazon Streaming by End of 2018) But it’s not only the internet companies’ ability to work directly with its customers that gives them an edge.

Adam Hayes,06082017,Investopedia,06012017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The present stock market rally is much broader than many investors think - and it goes well beyond big-name techs. While the so-called FAANGs - Facebook Inc.(FB), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN​), Apple Inc. (AAPL​), Netflix Inc. (NFLX​) and Google/Alphabet (GOOGL​) have dominated headlines in the past year, more than 70% of the stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their respective 200-day moving averages at Monday’s close, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing research of its WSJ Market Data Group. Surpassing such a measure is typically a technical sign of growing momentum in equities. Here's a closer look at the forces behind this trend. ""We think that the breadth of market performance has been sufficiently diffuse to allay investor fears of narrow performance,"" equity strategists at Morgan Stanley told clients in a note this week, according to the Journal. Data: Wall Street Journal, June 5 Tech stocks have been the buzzword among investors in 2017, with the technology heavy semiconductor ETF (SMH) up 22% on the year through Monday, far ahead of the S&P 500. The so-called FAANGs have been making headlines -  Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix Inc., and Apple are all up by more than 30% so far this year (Google/Alphabet is up 27.5%) through June 5, leading to investors to question whether a reversal in their shares would drag the broader market down. However, a deeper analysis shows that the gains are driven by stocks beyond the technology sector.  (See also: Participate in the Tech Rally with these ETFs.) Perhaps most important, nearly half of the stocks in the S&P 500 have beat the benchmark index this year, according to the Journal. Also, the market's advance-decline line, a key measure of health, has continued to hit new highs this year, according to the Journal's Market Data Group. The advance-decline line actually fell in advance of the two past big market crashes, the Journal said. The fact that 70% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading above their 200-day moving averages indicates that the vast majority of the index is showing technical indicators of strength. While the technology sector is leading the charge, sectors such as consumer discretionary, consumer staples, and utilities were all ahead of the broader benchmark. To be sure, the above analysis faces skepticism in many quarters. Some analysts quoted by CNBC say tech stocks still play far too big a role in the market's rise. ""Approximately a third of the stock market's gains this year have come from just five stocks as of last week: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet Class A shares, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in a May 30 CNBC story. (See also: Facebook, Google to Continue Digital Ad Domination.) But the WSJ Market Data team's numbers, nonetheless, make an important point. The credit that investors have given the big tech stocks for driving the overall market may have outstripped even these stocks' undeniably large role. The techs are key, but not the exclusive drivers of the market, which may be broader than investors might think.

(AAPL) released the HomePod, a product for the smart assistant market. A key sticking point after Apple's unveiling was the speaker's retail price. The HomePod, which will be available in December, will sell for $349. Other players in the smart assistant market have priced their products at much lower price points. For example, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) Echo series of speakers have prices that range from a minimum of $50 to a maximum of $180. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google's speakers sell for $129. Apple has justified the steep price by claiming that its device is actually two products rolled into one – a state-of-the-art speaker and a smart assistant that can answer user queries. (See also: Apple to Launch Smart Speaker This Month: Bloomberg.) To be sure, a read-through of the speaker's sound technology looks impressive. During an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook reinforced the speaker's acoustic capabilities. ""We've tried to build a breakthrough speaker first,"" he said, adding that the HomePod could reinvent the portable player area in the home. But the Cupertino, California-based company still has some catching up to do in making Siri as smart as Google Assistant or even Amazon's Alexa. According to a study by digital marketing agency Stone Temple Consulting, Google Assistant is the best smart assistant in town. It answered user queries 69 percent of the time and was correct 91 percent of the time. Microsoft Corporation's (MSFT​) smart assistant Cortana was in second place with a response rate of 56 percent and 82 percent correct responses. Apple's Siri was third with a 67 percent rate of answering questions correctly from the 22 percent of all user questions that it answered. Amazon's Alexa answered 21 percent of all user queries with an accuracy of 87 percent. (See also: Amazon's Alexa Will Approach 71% of the Smart Speaker Market: eMarketer.)

Bing users get points for searching, shopping the Windows Store, Xbox Store or Microsoft Store. There are also charities that Microsoft has teamed up with in the U.K. so users can turn their accumulated points into donations. According to a report in the Verge, participants get three points per Bing search with a maximum of 30 points per day—similar to how the program works in the U.S. If they are using the Microsoft Edge browser, that doubles to 60 points each day. Extra points can be garnered by taking part in quizzes. For every pound spent at the U.K. online Microsoft Store, reward recipients gets one point. For those that reach 500 points in one month, there is a higher level of rewards and the chance to earn 150 points per day. (See also: Microsoft Studying Multilingual Speech to Humanize Cortana.) While the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant may appear generous with its program for U.K. consumers, it’s all about getting more people to use Bing to conduct searches, an area where Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google dominates in most of the world. According to Statista, in April 2017, Google accounted for 85.74% of internet searchers in the U.K. with Bing in second place at 10.07%. Yahoo was a distant third with 3.16% of searches.

The dominance of technology companies in this year’s BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking shows the balance of power is shifting toward consumer-focused technology companies and away from those that aren’t playing in that market. Of the top 100 brands, more than half were technology related, which is up from a third in 2006. What’s more, tech brands have seen 16% growth in value in the last year compared to 4% for non-tech companies. Source: WPP and Kantar Millward Brown “This is the era of internet giants that have developed ever-growing ecosystems that touch and connect consumers, with the overall aim of making life easier, simpler and better,” said Doreen Wang, Kantar Millward Brown’s Global Head of BrandZ, in a press release announcing the results. “Technology with the consumer at its center has redefined our expectations, and we now take for granted that products, services, tools and content are immediately available at our fingertips. These brands also demonstrate great elasticity – they confidently and comfortably play in new territories and new categories to develop and expand their customer bases.” (See more: Google, Facebook Dominate Digital Ads in 2017) Google was able to maintain its top spot in the ranking but saw 7% growth in brand value compared to a year ago. Apple also kept its second place ranking with a 3% increase in value year-over-year while Microsoft stayed in third, but saw an 18% jump in its value. Amazon went to fourth place in 2017 from seventh place last year, enjoying a 41% increase in brand value. The firms said the ecommerce giant achieved the highest dollar value growth of all brands in the Top 100 ranking, increasing by $40.3 billion to $139.3 billion. They credited that to its focus on technology to meet the needs of different customer segments be it online shopping, near instant gratification with rapid delivery or entertainment thanks to the Echo speaker powered by its virtual assistant Alexa. Social network operator Facebook maintained the fifth place spot in the ranking, seeing a 27% increase in its value. Of the top 10, McDonald’s (MCD) was the only non-tech brand.

Mary Meeker’s latest internet trends report detailed just how dominant Amazon has become. Among the prominent venture capitalist’s most interesting findings was the revelation that the Seattle-based company now sells more batteries than Duracell and almost as many diapers as Procter & Gamble's (PG) leading brand Pampers. (See also: Amazon Hits $1000.) In her comprehensive breakdown of web habits, the analyst claimed that, as of August 2016, Amazon commanded just over 30 percent of the U.S. battery market, giving it a comfortable 10 percentage point lead over its closest rival Duracell, and ranked third in baby diapers sales with a 15 percent market share.

With an increasing number of consumers now preferring to shop online, Meeker reports that retail store closures are set to break a 20-year record. Source: KP Internet Trends 2017 Online retail sales in the U.S. grew 15 percent from 2015 to 2016, as package and parcel volumes surged 9 percent year-over-year. Those figures, and the revelation that an increasing number of companies are closing down brick-and-mortar stores, came as Amazon opened a book shop in New York and a grocery store in its native Seattle. Meeker also confirmed that Amazon’s Web Services (AWS) continues to dominate the cloud market. AWS is reportedly being used by 57 percent of IT professionals in 2017, representing the same level registered the previous year. However, the report added that Microsoft (MSFT) and Google  (GOOG) currently own 34 percent and 15 percent of the market, respectively, growing their share as an increasing number of customers choose to reduce their dependence on just one provider. Other big takeaways from the 355 slide opus included the forecast that internet advertising spend will overtake television advertising spending in the next six months. The report added that 85 percent of new online advertising dollars now go to Google and Facebook (FB). (See also: Google, Facebook Dominate Digital Ads in 2017.)

Don’t miss: Apple bets that you’ll adopt these three tech habits Online advertising continues to grow, with eMarketer and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Mary Meeker reporting that overall spending on digital ads has surpassed spending on television advertising recently. Facebook Inc. and Google are the leading beneficiaries, with eMarketer predicting those two companies will combine to control about half the digital-ad market this year. Morgan Stanley analysts predict that the new approach in web browsers will affect nearly 40% of the market, roughly $28 billion in annual spending in online display ads that appear in Safari and Chrome browsers. The potential slowdown would seem to be a negative for large online-ad companies like Facebook and Google, as the analysts note that the ability to track users and serve them ads has been a big driver in the growth of online ad revenue for all online-advertising platforms. That will not be the case though, they predict. “While there could be some near-term disruption, over the long-term these changes only put a higher value on large app platforms with data around their unique, logged-in and engaged user bases,” they wrote in a note Wednesday morning.

Therese Poletti,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 5, 2017 8:54 p.m. ET Opinion: Apple could help jump-start nascent AR consumer market By Apple Inc. finally made real its interest in the nascent markets of both augmented reality and virtual reality, a move that will likely push at least AR more into the mainstream and potentially drive future iPhone sales.

And while Apple’s costly consumer HomePod device got the most attention, Apple’s embrace of the two evolving reality-altering technologies with new software developer tools was focused on the future. Apple said the next version of its desktop operating system, Mac OS High Sierra, will have support for virtual-reality content creation for the first time, so developers can create immersive gaming, 3D and VR content on the Mac. It is also working with other virtual-reality companies, such as Unity Technologies and Epic Games, bringing their VR tools to the Mac. But its focus on augmented reality is really expected to help jump-start that young market for consumers, who have only seen augmented reality in mainstream use with the “Pokemon Go” game. Apple said as part of version 11 of its iOS for the iPhone and iPad, it will offer a developer kit called ARKit. Using the built-in cameras, powerful processors and motion sensors in Apple’s mobile devices, developers will be able to create games, shopping experiences and other apps by building virtual content on top of real-world scenes. Read:  Apple bets that you’ll adopt these 3 tech habits “A lot of the industry has been waiting for someone like Apple to come in and legitimize the space,” said Tom Mainelli, an IDC analyst. “Today was the first step.” Mainelli said that the long-term future of AR, like VR, is more about futuristic geeky goggles and big screens. “For the near term, it’s going to happen on smartphones,” he said.

                                   Google has been in this space for a while, he said. “Google Tango is a very robust AR platform. But it is very compute intensive.” Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about the potential for augmented reality and the iPhone for about a year, ever since he mispronounced “Pokemon Go” and made vague hints about its possibilities for Apple, but today’s news was the biggest concrete step forward in that direction. “It preserves and extends the value of the iPhone franchise,” said Frank Gillett, a Forrester Research analyst. “If they didn’t do this, I would have wondered.” Also see: Apple’s HomePod costs twice as much as Amazon’s Echo, but will it be twice as smart? Apple said that the new developer kit will be available today and that the resulting AR apps created will also run on some older iPhones — the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, SE, 7 and 7 Plus. IDC analysts estimate that the sales of those phones combined have an approximate installed base of about 250 million to 300 million users. Any new augmented-reality-infused apps will undoubtedly run best in whatever future products Apple launches next, yet another reason for consumers to buy the next shiny iPhone. So while Apple’s moves may help launch AR into the mainstream, investors want AR to jump-start the decline in iPhone sales, which fueled Apple’s fiscal 2016 year-over-year revenue decline. With AR, Apple has dual goals: Drive iPhone sales back to growth, and give developers and consumers new experiences in its ecosystem that will keep them there. These moves are definitely the right ones amid an enormous amount of speculation, both hopeful and pessimistic, surrounding the next iPhone launch. But execution will be key.

Suzanne Vranica,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 1, 2017 7:28 a.m. ET By GroupM, the umbrella firm that houses WPP's ad-buying shops, is consolidating two of its global ad-buying agencies to help reduce costs and enable investment in areas that may provide more growth. The company is combining MEC, a 15-year-old firm that has 127 offices and places advertising on behalf of clients such as L'Oreal and Vodafone, with Maxus, a nine-year-old firm with 70 offices and clients such as NBCUniversal and Barclays. The merger will result in cost savings that will likely come from cutting back on real estate, IT systems, back-office services and employees. No targets have been set for job cuts or the savings from such reductions, the company said. The collapsing of two well-known buying firms into one comes as ad holding companies face increased pressure from advertisers who continue to push for cost savings by shrinking the number of agencies they work with, cutting the fees they pay to agencies, and reducing ad spending. That pressure has eroded agencies' margins. ""We operate in a very competitive sector in a very competitive marketplace, and we do have to find efficiencies so we can invest in areas that will give us longer-term growth,"" said Kelly Clark, who was named GroupM's global chief executive about eight months ago. ""My job is to allocate resources in areas that give us growth in a challenging environment."" The cost savings derived from agency consolidation will help fund GroupM's plan to expand Essence, the digital ad-buying agency it bought in 2015. GroupM plans to open Essence offices in about six markets around the world over the next six to 12 months. Essence already operates in markets such as the U.K., U.S. and Australia. It also wants to expand Essence's expertise beyond digital ad buying to include buying traditional media such as TV and outdoor in a more digital and data-driven way. Essence's clients include Google and Visa. Agencies are anxious to offer clients new approaches to help them stand out in the agency space. Omnicom Group has had success with its new media agency Hearts & Science, which has been positioned as a buying firm focused on data-informed marketing. ""Agency services are highly commoditized,"" and ""most global media agencies are indistinguishable to most marketers,"" said Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. ""Having a differentiated offering may help agencies stand out, but it takes more than positioning."" GroupM will be left with three global ad-buying firms: Mindshare, Mediacom and the newly combined entity. It also owns the programmatic ad-buying platform Xaxis. The combined firm, which will eventually be renamed, will be led by Tim Castree, who is currently CEO of MEC. Lindsay Pattison, CEO of Maxus, was named GroupM's chief transformation officer last month. Combining Maxus and MEC brings together the two smaller ad-buying shops that GroupM owns. Maxus, whose billings were roughly $11 billion in 2015, is the smaller of the two and has underperformed its rivals. Last year, the firm lost ad-buying duties for Fiat Chrysler in Europe and Asia. ""It's been challenging for Maxus to grow in the U.S.,"" said Greg Paul, CEO of R3, a consultancy that works with agencies and marketers. ""They haven't built a large base of global clients"" the way other agencies such as Mediacom have over the years, he added. Mr. Clark said Maxus ""continues to be successful in local markets."" MEC, which had billings of roughly $25 billion in 2015, hasn't been immune, having lost duties for AT&T, a major account, last year.

Suzanne Vranica,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Mickey Drexler, the longtime chief of J. Crew Group who led the apparel chain through a leveraged buyout before struggling to cope with the rise of Amazon.com, will hand the reins to a veteran of Williams-Sonoma’s West Elm. The move is the most dramatic attempt yet to revive the fortunes of a storied retail brand that has seen sales swoon. Earlier this year, Drexler announced plans to shake up management and cut 250 jobs. As part of that overhaul, Chief Operating Officer Michael Nicholson was put in charge of overseeing the J. Crew brand. Adding to the turmoil, hedge funds that own J. Crew’s bonds have been jockeying to gain more control over a restructuring deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. In giving up the CEO job, Drexler is stepping back from a company he has controlled with often meticulous detail. In another seismic shift for J. Crew earlier this year, the apparel chain announced that creative director Jenna Lyons would leave by the end of the year. James Brett, West Elm’s president, will become chief executive at J. Crew next month, according to a statement Monday. The 72-year-old Drexler, who ran the business for more than 14 years, will remain chairman. “As chairman and an owner of the company, it is my responsibility to focus on the future of J. Crew and find the right leadership to execute on our strategic plans,” Drexler said in Monday’s statement. Brett was previously chief merchandising officer for Urban Outfitters, and he held various roles at Anthropologie, J.C. Penney and May Department Stores. Drexler come to J. Crew after turning around Gap in the 1990s. He also launched that company’s Old Navy division, which went on to become its biggest source of revenue. J. Crew’s private-equity investor TPG recruited Drexler to run the retailer in 2003. He invested $11 million of his own money in the business. In a 2011 buyout led by TPG, his stake was worth about $301 million. He pocketed $202 million and rolled the rest into an 8 percent stake, according to company filings. — Bloomberg News  ",Struggling J. Crew getting a new CEO - The Washington Post

Now Mickey Drexler, the industry-legend chief executive of J. Crew, is stepping down. For the storied retailer, it’s the latest change as it works to turn around flagging sales and negotiates with the sources of its more than $2 billion in credit. J. Crew sweaters and tees — whether purchased over the years via catalogs, in stores or on the company’s website — are a staple of many an American wardrobe. Experts say that, unlike rivals that admit their merchandise is not resonating with shoppers, J. Crew is not foundering from a fashion standpoint. Read: Stressed retailers like J. Crew and Neiman Marcus are doing something unusual to manage debt Also: J.C. Penney, Gymboree and J. Crew at risk – and it’s not all Amazon’s fault “The prior regime was good at driving growth and upside and being visionary,” said Larry Perkins, chief executive of SierraConstellation Partners, a financial advisory and turnaround firm. But they were “a little less good at minding the store. It’s no coincidence that they’re involved in this large negotiation and the two big people step aside.” The negotiation is a debt exchange that would allow J. Crew to lower leverage and extend the maturity of debt due in 2019 through 2021. The company has placed the intellectual property of its brand into a new company and is offering bondholders new notes issued by that company in exchange for existing notes. The new notes offer a higher coupon, and the company is also offering some equity. But creditors have argued that the IP is collateral on existing borrowings and that removing it constitutes a default. With the parties unable to reach an agreement, J. Crew has filed a suit in New York State Supreme Court to establish the legality of the move. Lyons and Drexler, meanwhile, are the names most closely tied to J. Crew. Lyons, who was with the company for 26 years, announced she’d be stepping down in April. J. Crew announced Drexler’s departure during the after-hours session Monday; he is to stay on as chairman.

Crew’s current challenges,” Silverman said. But the news doesn’t change Fitch’s view of continued near-term challenges for the J. Crew brand, “nor does it impact the company’s current capital-structure challenges and need to address its upcoming maturities,” Silverman said. Like all clothing retailers, J. Crew is operating in a fast-paced and highly competitive world.

Also: Amazon’s new bookstore keeps shoppers on the Amazon website Ryan Berger, senior partner at HYPR, a search engine for influencers who has taught word-of-mouth marketing at New York University, believes the company also has an image problem, he said. “People believe if you wear J. Crew, you’re not cool,” he said, particularly millennials, who favor retailers like Zara, H&M and TopShop. However, he said he’s a fan of the merchandise. “They have to figure out how they tell their story and how you experience J. Crew, which is a problem for all retail brands.” SierraConstellation’s Perkins thinks J. Crew’s store locations are “the albatross hanging around their neck” with a high concentration in geographies like New York and cannibalization between the stores and the website, he said. Berger said the stores are boring. Don’t miss: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer “In the store, they have to do more innovative things,” he said. One retailer he highlights as creating an experience that’s driving traffic is Nike Inc.

You may want to think twice about how you use online travel booking sites like Expedia and Orbitz. Recently, the hotel industry has all but declared war on online travel agencies, which charge high commissions when they book rooms on behalf of hotel companies. To woo customers, hotels are offering lower deals and better perks to members of their loyalty programs that book directly.

                                   have rendered the online third-party travel industry into something of a duopoly. Expedia’s holdings include CheapTickets, Hotels.com, Hotwire Group, Orbitz, Trivago and Travelocity, while Priceline Group owns Booking.com and Kayak. For consumers, the choice between booking directly with an airline or hotel and going through a third-party remains a generational one, said Mark Blutstein, a research analyst with travel research firm Phocuswright. Older travelers and those who have racked up loyalty or reward points are more likely to buy airline tickets or reserve a hotel room directly. Younger travelers, meanwhile, are obsessed about price. As a result, they tend to flock to sites like Kayak or Travelocity in order to comparison shop. “They’re looking for the best deal they can get,” Blutstein said. In many cases, booking directly with an airline or hotel can yield significant benefits over booking with a third-party site like Orbitz. But the latter can remain an important tool for all types of travelers, when used properly. MarketWatch breaks it down: Why you should book directly through a hotel or airline When booking with a hotel directly, consumers often choose from among three different rates, said Bjorn Hanson, a professor with the New York University Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. These include a public rate with no discounts, a discounted rate for members of loyalty programs, and a discounted non-refundable rate. “Almost always, one of those three will be as low or lower than the rate through an online travel agency for a similar arrangement,” Hanson said. That’s in part because many sites like Expedia charge hotels a commission for the booking they get, which is 15% on average, Hanson said. (Expedia would not disclose its commission. A spokeswoman for Priceline Group said that Booking.com does not charge a commission to hotels, but did not comment on other sites owned by the company.) As a result, hotels often don’t offer up their best deals on these sites, since they are already taking a hit on the booking. “There’s some price cutting we’re seeing in the marketplace to drive direct bookings,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Expedia. Don’t miss: Move over New York and London, these unlikely foreign locales have seen a spike in interest from tourists this summer Similarly with air travel, travelers will usually save by booking directly with an airline. In recent years, airlines have begun levying a fee when customers book through sites like Expedia, making those prices less competitive. Lower prices aren’t the only reason to book directly with a hotel or airline. People who go straight to the hotel or airline for their reservations can receive preferential treatment in many cases, such as upgrades or free services like internet. There’s also a greater chance that special requests made at booking will be honored when it is done directly. “Chances are you’ll be treated a little better, but sometimes you do need to call it out to them,” said Gautum Lulla, president of Travel Tripper, a hotel booking technology provider. Booking directly also proves useful in emergencies, such as when a traveler misses a flight or needs to cancel a reservation, according to Scott Mackenzie, founder and editor-in-chief of Travel Codex, a website that covers news about travel loyalty programs. “Whenever there’s a delay or cancellation, it makes it a lot easier to re-book the ticket,” Mackenzie said. “There also may be more flexibility with the rules.” Third-party sites like Expedia are aware of concerns related to the post-booking customer experience, Khosrowshahi said, noting recent efforts to expand the inventory on Expedia’s sites that is cancelable. “It’s a fair criticism of Expedia 10 years ago, but the Expedia today is much better than it was,” he said. “These features were not on the site even four years ago.” These policies can vary from one third-party site to another. For instance, Booking.com uses a “pay-when-you-stay” model, Priceline Group head of global communications Leslie Cafferty said in an email. “So most bookings are cancellable (via one click on the site) up until close to the time of booking,” she added. When to use third-party travel sites The main reason to visit websites like Expedia when booking a vacation in spite of some drawbacks is the obvious one: They are great search tools. “It’s pretty much the only way to compare prices,” Mackenzie said. Even travelers who are inclined to choose a particular hotel or airline can benefit from researching on these sites, especially in instances where a preferred chain or carrier is not available at their destination. More bad news for travel sites: They can also be used for “showrooming.” A search on Booking.com, for instance, can help a traveler figure out which hotel or airline has the best deal, and then they can book directly. Consumers should also differentiate the sites that operate like travel agencies (Expedia or Priceline.com) from sites that simply perform searches. On Kayak, consumers can research their options, but the actual bookings go through the company promoting the deal in question (which can be a hotel or air carrier or another online travel agency like Priceline.) Also see: This is the most Instagrammed place in the world But the unparalleled search functions aren’t online travel agencies’ only benefits. For consumers who aren’t devoted to a particular brand, the hotel rewards offered through some online travel agencies can be worth 5% or 10% more than those provided by hotel chains, Mackenzie said. (Airlines’ membership programs still beat sites like Expedia, though.) For instance, the rewards program through Hotels.com provides members with a free night for every 10 nights they book through the site. And through the Orbitz Rewards program, consumers can earn points toward discounts on hotels by booking through the site, eating at participating restaurants or using the affiliated Visa card. And booking travel through a third-party site can occasionally be cheaper. For instance, online travel agencies can sometimes afford to layer on their own discounts, offering potential savings. “Because they have such high margins, sometimes they take a few dollars out of the rate they’re supposed to charge the consumer,” Lulla said. Booking combination packages that include airfare or car rentals is another way that the savings can add up on third-party sites. And so-called “hacker fares” through sites like Kayak.com that involve flights from multiple airlines for a given itinerary can be cheaper than booking through a single carrier. But consumers should still research to see if they can recreate the savings offered through such packages on their own, Mackenzie said. “The mistake people make is not searching anymore once they find something,” he added. “You’re going to get out of it what you put into it.” ",When you should use travel booking sites like Expedia and Priceline — and when you shouldn’t - MarketWatch

Jeremy C. Owens,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 6, 2017 1:03 p.m. ET Opinion: Combination of HomePod, virtual and augmented reality and peer-to-peer payments unveiled at WWDC could help reverse revenue declines By Apple Inc. did not invent the smartphone, the personal computer, nor the tablet, but it did help cement mass consumer adoption of that hardware and made billions of dollars because of it. With Monday’s announcements at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple is hoping to take a host of other niche technologies to mainstream acceptance. For these efforts to actually have an effect on Apple’s balance sheet, they may have to prove wildly popular. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and fellow top Apple executives discussed a range of new and refreshed offerings from Apple in the WWDC keynote address, but three announcements focused specifically on promising areas of tech that have yet to become mainstream: Augmented and virtual reality, smart speakers and peer-to-peer payments. Each of those segments has a consumer following and companies that cater to them, but Apple is now threatening to treat them as it did BlackBerry with the iPhone. These efforts could be essential for Apple

Gartner predicted last year that such speakers would become a $2 billion business by 2020, while eMarketer predicts 35.6 million Americans will interact with such a device this year. Read:  Apple unveils smart speaker with focus on music as it battles Google, Amazon Also see:  Apple’s HomePod will have to be this smart to compete with Alexa and Echo Apple could speed up that adoption, and find more than the $350 in revenue each HomePod will deliver. Much as the iPhone and iPad’s adoption led to a large chunk of app fees from mobile developers, Apple hopes that growing adoption of smart home devices and appliances will connect with the HomePod and bring similar chunks of one-time purchases and subscription fees. HomePod is also marketed to challenge Sonos and other speaker systems that are focused on music delivery. That functionality could help support the growing Apple Music streaming offering that Apple said Monday has already attracted 27 million paying subscribers. “We think the product takes on music speakers as much as it does Echo/Work like products,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note Monday afternoon. Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research agreed, and said the HomePod’s price “is actually really competitive” when compared to high-end audio devices. “I would bet that Apple will sell a lot of these at Christmas and into next year,” he wrote in a note Monday. Cook has said several times that Apple believes more in augmented reality than virtual reality, which could be headed for an expensive niche category. Apple offered its own expensive, niche solution for VR, the $5,000 iMac Pro that sports Advanced Micro Devices Corp.

For augmented reality, Apple is pushing for acceptance in its devices and hoping developers find new hits like Pokemon Go, which got time on stage at the WWDC keynote as Apple introduced a new software kit for AR. IDC predicted that spending on AR software could surpass VR software as soon as next year, although much of that spending is expected to be focused on enterprise usage. Read:  Apple accepts reality, but can it take AR and VR to mainstream? Apple is taking a different approach to augmented and virtual worlds, Dawson added. “In VR, Apple is mostly enabling third-party editing and creation of VR content for consumption on other platforms and to an extent on the Mac, whereas with AR Apple is focused on developers creating apps for the iPhone and iPad,” Dawson wrote. “So it’s embracing AR as an immediate first-party opportunity while keeping VR at arm’s length when it comes to mobile platforms, in contrast to Samsung and other smartphone vendors.” In peer-to-peer payments, PayPal Holdings Inc.’s

Peer-to-peer payments are unlikely to generate enough revenue to make a real difference for Apple, however, a problem shared with all of Apple’s new ventures. The company makes so much money from its iPhones — $136.7 billion last fiscal year and $87.6 billion through six months of the current fiscal year — that it would take quite a hit to lead to a boost to Apple’s overall sales. They key to all of these efforts is the potential to attract users to Apple’s ecosystem and get them to spend more money there, with a cut going to Apple and its growing software and services revenue. As the iPhone business and the majority of Apple’s other segments failed to grow last year, the software and services business continued its steady ascent, surpassing $24 billion in annual revenue. The HomePod will have to be a big hit, greater than the Apple Watch has been, to truly affect Apple’s bottom line. But the combination of a new premium-priced hardware device with a wave of potential software offerings in growing fields could be enough to at least offer Apple some growth, if it can avoid further iPhone sales declines. Apple stock fell 1% Monday after gaining 4.4% in the past month, part of a pattern noted by BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk, who has tracked a gain in Apple shares for the month prior to the WWDC keynote for eight of the past 10 years, with an average gain of 4.2%, and a decline on the day of the event for all 10 years.

Ciara Linnane,06082017,MarketWatch,06012017,"Published: June 5, 2017 10:45 a.m. ET Children’s clothing retailer has been in talks with advisers since January on how best to repair its balance sheet By Children’s clothing retailer Gymboree is expected to file for bankruptcy in the coming weeks or even days, after it elected not to make an interest payment on $171 million of bonds that was due on Thursday. The troubled company, which has been in talks with investment banks and advisers on ways to repair its balance sheet since January, has a 30-day grace period before it is officially in default. But it’s expected to announce some kind of prearranged or prepackaged filing in the near term that will allow it to proceed in an orderly fashion, said Reshmi Basu, associate editor of restructuring at Debtwire. “It’s a story that has been playing out for some time,” she told MarketWatch. “Now, we’ll see the lenders take control, they will reset the footprint and work with advisers on which unprofitable locations should be closed down.” Like rivals, Gymboree has been suffering from the many factors currently clobbering the retail sector, from weak mall traffic trends to changing consumer behavior to the onslaught from Amazon.com Inc

                                    The rise of e-commerce is forcing many to invest heavily in their own online and delivery technology, at a time when sales are under pressure. Gymboree is expected to keep its Janie & Jack line, which is still successful, but to ditch its Crazy 8 brand, which is flailing, said Basu. The company is in talks to retain Great American Group and Tiger Group, two companies that specialize in asset appraisals, liquidations and inventory auctions, she said. In case you missed it: Stressed retailers like J. Crew and Neiman Marcus are doing something unusual to manage debt Related:  J.C. Penney, Gymboree and J. Crew at risk -- and it’s not all Amazon’s fault “They will probably liquidate unprofitable brands and leverage the Janie & Jack line and beef up their e-commerce,” she said. Gymboree is another retailer that is saddled with debt taken on in a leveraged buyout. The company was acquired by Mitt Romney’s former firm Bain Capital in 2010 for $1.8 billion. Today, the company has $1.043 billion of debt, split between a $769 million term loan, the $171 million of 9125% senior secured notes due December of 2018, an $80 million ABL revolving credit facility and a $49 million first-lien ABL term loan. It had $22 million cash and cash equivalents as of Jan. 28, plus $73 million of restricted cash, according to a regulatory filing. “Its leverage is more than 12 times, which is hard to sustain,” said Basu. Don’t miss: Retail carnage continues as sector’s job growth falls for fourth straight month The company’s bonds were last trading at 8.729 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess, deep into distressed territory. Its term loan was quoted at 44 cents to 46 cents on the dollar, according to Debtwire. See also: Neiman Marcus is now borrowing money to make interest payments on its debt Gymboree is one of the companies on Fitch Ratings’ list of loans and bonds of concern, which features those issuers with a significant risk of defaulting on their borrowings within the next 12 months.

,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has reached a tax settlement with Alphabet Inc’s Google for 2016, the country’s finance minister said, following a months-long dispute over allegations that the search giant had not made enough annual payments to the government. A senior tax official had said in September that Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, planned to pursue Google for five years of back taxes and the company could face a bill of more than $400 million for 2015 alone if it were found to have avoided payments. “We already have an agreement with them based on 2016. But we can’t disclose the figure,” Indonesia Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told reporters on Tuesday. It was unclear if both sides were still locking horns over Google’s taxes for other years. Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program. Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as corporate tax avoidance. Last year, Google agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($164 million) in back taxes to settle a probe by Britain’s tax authority, while Thailand is studying plans to toughen tax collection rules for internet and technology firms. According to Indonesian tax officials, most of Google’s revenue generated in the country is booked at its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. They also estimated that total advertising revenue for the industry in Indonesia was around $830 million, with Google and Facebook Inc accounting for around 70 percent of that. But Google has pointed to a joint study by the company and Singapore state investor Temasek that estimated the size of Indonesia’s digital advertising market at $300 million for 2015. Senior executives from Google’s Asia Pacific headquarters also met Indonesian tax officials in October to discuss its tax bill, a person with knowledge of the matter said. ($1 = 0.7908 pounds) ","

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday that Indonesia had now reached a tax deal with Google for 2016. She declined to disclose the settlement sum. “On the solution for future taxes, they (Google Asia Pacific) have agreed with the government,” said Rudiantara, Indonesian Minister of Communications and Information, who has oversight on internet-based companies operating in the country. This may be subject to a change in Indonesia’s regulation for the advertising business, which has been proposed by the communications ministry, said Rudiantara, who goes by one name. The ministry will work with Indonesia’s investment coordinating board on the regulation, he added. Rudiantara declined to comment on whether Google had reached an agreement with Indonesia on its taxes for previous years. Indonesian tax officials have alleged that most of Google’s revenue generated in the country is booked at its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore and its local entity, PT Google Indonesia, simply acts as a sales service provider. Under a new agreement, Google’s Indonesian entity will receive the revenue and pay expenses for its business in the country, said a senior government source, who declined to be identified as the information was not public. It is unclear if Google will set up a new domestic unit that is separate from PT Google Indonesia. Google did not respond to requests for comment.

,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"SoftBank said it would buy Boston Dynamics and Tokyo-based Schaft, which design and manufacture robots that simulate human movement, but did not disclose the terms of the transactions. Shares of the company rose as much as 7.9 percent after the deal was announced, hitting a 17-year high. “Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the information revolution, and Marc (Raibert) and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots,” SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son said in a statement on Friday. Raibert is CEO and founder of Boston Dynamics. SoftBank has embarked on an aggressive acquisition campaign to boost its research and development capabilities. The group is backing the $93 billion Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund that seeks to invest in technologies expected to grow significantly in the near future, such as robotics and artificial intelligence. Son, Japan’s richest man, describes the fund as essential for setting up SoftBank for a data “gold rush” which he expects to happen as the global economy becomes increasingly digitized. Boston Dynamics and Schaft could eventually be vested with the Vision Fund, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters Schaft, a University of Tokyo spinoff, develops bipedal robots designed to negotiate uneven terrain. “Robotics as a field has great potential, and we’re happy to see Boston Dynamics and Schaft join the SoftBank team to continue contributing to the next generation of robotics,” an Alphabet spokesperson said. Boston Dynamics has produced a number of robots that mimic human and animal movement, including Atlas, a humanoid model that co-ordinates motion and balance using its arms and legs and can pick itself up off the ground when knocked over. It is best known for building robots that look as if they belong in science-fiction movies and are often co-developed or funded by the U.S. military. Its military projects would mean the acquisition is likely to be subject to regulatory approval from Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The company was acquired by Google in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, but the team struggled to find its place within the tech giant after Rubin’s departure, former Boston Dynamics employees said. “They’re advancing the state of the art in independent robotics. They are probably the leader in the U.S.,” said Arnis Mangolds, a robotics expert who has worked with Boston Dynamics. “But the problem is it’s not ready for prime time, and very few people have a tolerance for that.” ","

,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cross-border money transfer service WorldRemit is enabling its immigrant customer base to send money home using Android Pay, making it the first international remittance firm to run on the Google payments system, the company said on Tuesday. Connecting with Android Pay will enable WorldRemit customers in developed markets like Europe or North America to make instant international money transfers to reach the 112 million accounts available via WorldRemit’s network of payment channels. London-based WorldRemit says it handles about three-quarters of mobile phone-based international money transfers, a small but fast-growing segment of the global $575 billion worldwide remittance market. Recipients using WorldRemit can up pick cash or deposit money in banks or mobile money accounts or top up mobile accounts. Android Pay is a secure way for smartphone users to store credit, debit or loyalty cards to make payments online or in stores which Google has set up in about 15 of the world’s most advanced markets since launching it two years ago. In effect, smartphone users where Android Pay is available will have a simple and secure way to make money transfers to the 125 countries where WorldRemit operates. “Our customers often complete money transfer transactions while talking to family or friends on WhatsApp,” WorldRemit Chief Executive Ismail Ahmed said in an interview last week at the MoneyConf financial technology conference in Madrid. “Anything we can do to simplify that process is a big thing for us.” Ahmed, a former United Nations development advisor from Somaliland, set up WorldRemit in 2010 and has raised nearly $150 million in equity funding from venture firms including Accel and TCV and another $45 million in debt financing. Once Android Pay is set up, transfers can be done in five clicks via the WorldRemit service, the company said. Using this route, customers no longer have to re-enter credit card details or pass additional security tests that can derail transactions. The cost of transfers via Android Pay are in line with other credit or debit card processing fees it charges - normally well under 5 percent - WorldRemit said. WorldRemit makes money by charging basic handling fees and a small mark-up on foreign exchange rates, which typically undercut rates charged by traditional, agent-based transfer firms like Western Union and MoneyGram. Online payments firm PayPal began offering Android Pay to U.S. customers for domestic shopping or other transactions in April, but has not expanded internationally. ","

Le géant américain de l’internet va effectuer cet investissement via sa filiale Verily dédiée aux sciences en partenariat avec le groupe pharmaceutique suisse Novartis et le Fonds européen d’investissement, a précisé jeudi Medicxi, une entreprise de capital-risque spécialisée dans les biotechologies, issue d’Index Ventures. Verily a déjà noué des accords avec GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Novartis et Johnson & Johnson pour mettre en oeuvre de nouvelles technologies dans des domaines allant du diabète à la chirurgie robotique. Le mois dernier, il a recruté Robert Califf, l’ancien directeur de la Food and Drug Administration (FDA), l’autorité sanitaire américaine. Google a également créé une société de biotechnologie baptisée Calico qui travaille sur des traitements contre le vieillissement. Le géant de l’internet détient aussi un fonds de placement appelé GV, ex-Google ventures, qui a investi dans des dizaines de startups spécialisées dans la santé, principalement aux Etats-Unis. Sa dernière initiative vise à présent à soutenir le développement de médicaments en investissant dans des entreprises de biotechnologie européennes en phase avancée. Le nouveau fonds concernera des entreprises, cotées ou non, ayant des produits déjà à mi-parcours de la phase II de développement clinique. Cette initiative reflète également les bouleversements observés dans le secteur avec des entreprises technologiques qui jouent désormais un rôle direct dans l’innovation en matière de santé. Verily nommera par exemple deux membres au conseil consultatif scientifique du nouveau fonds. D’autres groupes technologiques comme Apple et Microsoft investissent également dans la santé, convaincus que les capacités informatiques modernes et la miniaturisation peuvent aider à accélérer les progrès dans le traitement médical. Francesco De Rubertis, cofondateur et associé chez Medicxi, a expliqué qu’une grande partie de l’investissement devrait aller vers des entreprises en Grande-Bretagne, en Suisse et dans la zone s’étirant de Paris à Bruxelles et Amsterdam. L’Europe ne dispose que d’une petite proportion de sociétés de biotechnologies à succès, comme le spécialiste danois du cancer Genmab, actuellement valorisé 13 milliards de dollars, et le suisse Actelion Pharmaceutical, en cours de rachat par l’américain Johnson & Johnson’s pour 30 milliards de dollars.

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California and other states would be barred from setting their own rules governing design and testing of self-driving cars, while federal regulators would be blocked from demanding pre-market approval for autonomous vehicle technology, according to a U.S. House Republican proposal reviewed by Reuters on Thursday. The draft legislation, while far from becoming law, still represents a victory for General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and other automakers and technology companies seeking to persuade Congress and the Trump administration to pre-empt rules under consideration in California, New York and other states that could limit deployment of self-driving vehicles. The industry also opposed an Obama administration proposal last year that raised the possibility of giving regulators the power to review and approve self-driving car technology before it was put into service, similar to the vetting by Federal Aviation Administration of new technology for aircraft. The 45-page draft package of 14 bills would designate the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, pre-empting state rules. States could still set insurance and registration rules but could not use them as a way to regulate self-driving technologies. California has proposed changes to its self-driving car rules, but automakers said in April it has not gone far enough. One of the bills in the proposal would allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles per year from U.S. federal motor vehicle safety rules, which currently prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, pedals and other human controls. Another would declare crash data, other testing and validation reports from automated cars turned over to U.S. regulators to be “confidential business information.” U.S. Representative Bob Latta, who chairs a key panel overseeing automobile regulation, called the draft legislation “an important step in establishing a framework to allow innovators to safely develop and test autonomous vehicles.” He said Republicans want “to continue working with all parties in a bipartisan manner as we refine language and move toward a consensus package.” On Tuesday, a bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, told Congress on Wednesday it should work to eliminate state or local laws that could “unduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future.” ","

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"(Reuters) - A recent slump in technology stocks worsened on Thursday, dragging on major U.S. indexes, while investors fretted about the economy’s health after the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates. The S&P technology sector fell 0.5 percent, continuing a slide that began last Friday. The sector cut steeper losses from earlier in the session, as did the benchmark S&P 500. Apple shares ended down 0.6 percent while Google parent Alphabet dropped 0.8 percent after separate bearish analysts reports on the two tech heavyweights. The consumer discretionary sector dropped 0.5 percent, as Amazon.com shares closed down 1.3 percent. Nike fell 3.2 percent after the company said it would cut about 2 percent of its global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles. Tech, still the best-performing group this year, and consumer discretionary have been among the sectors that have fueled the S&P 500’s 8.6-percent rally in 2017. “You seem to be losing some momentum in the big growth names that have led the market so far this year,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “At the same time, the economic data has just not been good enough to get investors excited about buying into other areas of the market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.66 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,359.9, the S&P 500 lost 5.46 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,432.46 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.39 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,165.50. Financials and energy, sectors that should thrive during economic expansions, also sold off. Financials slipped 0.4 percent and energy fell 0.7 percent. Utilities and real estate, which are high-dividend paying groups known as “bond proxies”, gained 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, making them the best performing sectors along with the 0.6 percent rise for   industrials. “If your best-performing sectors are real estate and utilities, it’s a good sign that interest rates are dominating the equity market,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist with TIAA Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields had tumbled to their lowest since early November on Wednesday after surprisingly weak data on inflation and retail sales overshadowed the Fed’s interest rate hike. Following that disappointing economic data, a report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to shrinking labor market slack that could allow the Fed to raise interest rates again this year despite moderate inflation growth. “Monetary policy got hawkish,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. “Fiscal policy is getting delayed and inflation will not cooperate the way the markets and the Fed want it to.” In other corporate news, Kroger shares tumbled 18.9 percent after the supermarket chain slashed its full-year profit forecast. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the nearly 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.78-to-1 ratio favored decliners. ","

 ,06152017,Reuters,06082017,"The new traffic routers can handle the greater demands of virtual reality programming, cloud-based internet services and next-generation mobile communications, the Finnish company said. For these “web-scale” customers speed is everything and unlike Nokia’s traditional telecoms customers they are still increasing spending on network gear. The routers are compatible with older products and will also serve Nokia’s existing customers who want speed but must still contend with legacy gear needed to run existing services. “Nokia will have the highest-performance system capacity in the market, and a lot of those web-scalers, they just want speed,” Ray Mota, principal analyst at ACG Research, told Reuters. The former Alcatel IP networks business is already the world’s No. 2 player in edge routers behind Cisco, having displaced Juniper Networks, which is now No. 3. The Nokia business also competes with Huawei [HWT.UL] in router markets outside the United States, where the privately-held Chinese firm is barred for national security reasons. Nokia executives expect to take market share from all the big competitors, including Cisco and Juniper as well as Huawei. “Whether its web-scale or vertical markets (such as banks, transportation, energy and public sector), where we have been less exposed in routers, clearly we will gain share,” Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told Reuters in an interview. “This gives us momentum in core routing.” Simon Leopold, a financial analyst with Raymond James, said Juniper, which depends for around a quarter of sales from web-scale customers such as Facebook could be hardest hit. “There is at least headline risk to Juniper, once Nokia ships,” he said. Shares of Juniper Networks fell 2.4 percent to $28.60, while Cisco fell 1 percent to $31.38. Nokia’s U.S.-listed shares dipped a little under 1 percent. Nokia said it is introducing its latest FP4 silicon chipset capable of processing data at 2.4 terabits per second. The new chipsets are set to ship in the fourth quarter, with routers running FP4 chips ready in the first quarter of next year. These will be built into routers to operate both ultra high-speed “core” networks at the heart of the biggest internet services and also “edge” networks that link datacentres to front-line customer services on mobile or fixed-line networks. Telecom operators’ capital spending is rising by just 2-3 percent a year which means Nokia is turning to web-scale players whose spending on new network gear is growing by double-digits. Nokia is introducing the 7950 petabit-class router aimed at the core routing market to help it win business from customers such as Apple and Facebook. A petabit can transmit 5,000 two-hour-long high-definition videos every second.For edge network customers, Nokia is introducing its 7750 router, offering the highest traffic capacity on the market. Mota said the Nokia 7750 can deliver speeds of up to 4.8 terabits per slot, compared with Juniper’s 3 terabit edge router speeds, which had been the industry’s fastest. A terabit can transfer a high-definition Netflix TV episode in one second. Beyond sheer speed, there is enough processing power head-room in its new chipset to offer built-in security features to fend off distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. “If you look at London, one of the busiest parts of our network, we need this platform today,” McRae said.

Michael J. Kramer,06152017,Investopedia,06082017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs It is another FANG-focused day. Or is it FAAMG? I get confused sometimes. FANG is short for Facebook Inc. (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). FANG is comprised of four high-performing technology stocks of 2017. Similarly, FAAMG is the acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google. You get the picture. There is no doubt these are some of the best-performing stocks of 2017, but surely the constant attention on them is just too much sometimes. On Thursday, Canaccord analyst Michael Graham fired a shot across the bow of FANG, downgrading Alphabet to hold from buy, but reiterated his price target at $1,000. As for the rest of FANG, the analyst noted a lot of the good news is already baked into the share prices. The FANG quartet is trading lower by 1.5 percent. FB data by YCharts Is FANG overvalued? That's tough to say for so many reasons. We have a couple of things to contend with, the first being a slow growth environment. Companies that can offer potentially strong growth get a premium valuation. Second, the companies are being priced off future expectations, and the analyst community has been setting those expectations relatively high based on current estimates. Finally, what is the correct historical valuation for a company that is going through multiple growth phases? This chart shows you the trailing 12-month revenue for each company in the FANG group overlaid with the annual revenue estimates going out to 2019. FB Annual Revenue Estimates data by YCharts We can see here that revenue growth for Amazon has been gigantic over the past decade. The same is true for Alphabet, with Facebook ramping, and Netflix just really starting to kick into gear. The chart below shows the expected revenue growth from the end of 2016 until the end of 2019 for each company. FB Annual Revenue Estimates data by YCharts So we have monster growth rates, living in a world with long-term interest rates around 2 percent, and 1 percent inflation. Certainly, investors are willing to pay a premium for these companies given the environment. We can see from the companies listed above that Facebook is the most expensive of the stocks based on the one-year forward PS ratio. FB PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts On the chart, you can also see that on December 31, 2015, Facebook was trading at a forward PS ratio of 7.69. Today it is 8.7. Alphabet was 4.97; it is now 5.26. Netflix was 4.35; today it is 4.79. And Amazon was 1.92, and today it's 2.27. The rise in valuations is due to the increasingly higher expectations for revenue growth; it is not because of pure multiple expansion. FB PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts GOOGL PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts It isn't that these stocks are rising without merit. They are rising and the valuations are expanding because the expectations for them moving forward are rising and growing. One last thing to consider as to why these FANG stocks are driving the markets higher is the construction of the Indies themselves. The Nasdaq Composite is a market cap weight index. When the top companies in the index are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), Intel Corporation (INTC), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO ), Amgen Inc. (AMGN ) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), you want to see the FANG stocks continue to lead the markets higher. The FANG stocks are the generals, the leaders, and all the other companies, are the soldiers that follow. If the FANG stocks are struggling, it is probably a pretty good sign that the market as a whole would be struggling.

The market and use cases for smart assistants and artificial intelligence in daily life are exploding, but Apple, which pioneered the industry with Siri back in 2012, is caught in a bind. Beset by internal delays, the company has fallen behind rivals Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google. Apple could also face further complications down the road thanks to its insistence on user privacy. A recent Wall Street Journal report provides a bunch of reasons why Apple lost ground to rivals in artificial intelligence. These range from departures of key executives to a revision of the company's original vision for Siri. The end result of these developments is that Apple launched its smart speaker a good two years after its rivals. (See also: Amazon's Alexa Will Approach 71% of Smart Speaker Market: eMarketer.) Catchphrases for Amazon's Alexa and Google Home have overtaken Siri in popularity. Public recall makes a big difference when you are positioning your device to become a default choice for smart assistants. In turn, Siri's fading away from public consciousness could have a significant effect on Apple's hardware sales and, consequently, its bottom line. The lure of smart assistants to tech behemoths lies in customer data. The data can be used in two ways. The companies can apply it to craft customized products and services for users. For example, Amazon can use the data to boost its e-commerce business by proving personalized and timely shopping recommendations. Technology companies can also sell the data to advertisers. An instance of this occurred recently, when Google Home played an ad for a movie release. Both routes to monetization may be difficult for Apple, given its insistence on user privacy. (See also: Google's Home Assistant Is Now Playing Ads.) Increasingly, Apple has chosen to market itself as a company that does not compromise customer data. This rules out generating revenue through advertising channels on services that use Siri. Even in China, the company's second largest market, the government could force Apple's hand on user data and limit its options for monetizing the data generated by its smart assistant. (See also: 9 Apple Products That Changed the World.) This means that Apple will have to depend on sales of hardware devices that integrate Siri, such as the iPhone and HomePod. But the company's efforts to improve these products may be stymied due to lack of user data. According to the WSJ article, Apple randomly tags Siri search searches and keeps them in its database for only six months. Eddy Cue, vice president of internet software at Apple, is quoted as saying that the company ""often uses"" generic data rather than user data to train Siri. The results of this strategy are shown in Siri's performance, which lags that of rival AI systems. (See also: Is the Price for Apple's HomePod Justified?)

""And also the over-storing of America. We could lose a third of our retail space and probably not miss it."" America may have already lost a third of its retail space. From mid-market clothing companies Michael Kors and Bebe to department stores such as Macy's and Sears, 2017 has been a tough year for retail. ""The winners are consumers and Amazon shareholders,"" Galloway said. (See also: Retail Deathwatch Continues) This analysis comes on the heels of a bad couple of days on Wall Street, as investors take profit on what's been a bumper six months. Despite the short-term volatility, tech stocks continue to reign with four in the top five list of biggest companies by market cap. Apple Inc (AAPL) is well ahead of the field with a market cap of $775 billion, over $100 billion bigger than second place Alphabet Inc (GOOG) - the parent company of Google. Yet neither of these seem as poised as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to win the race to $1 trillion. The growth of Amazon has been meteoric, and it's hard to argue it won't surpass Apple and Google on its march to $1 trillion. At the end of 2016, Amazon had over 65 million Prime customers, a 44 percent increase from the end of 2015, according to calculations by Morgan Stanley. And as Prime customer spending continues to dwarf regular account holders, revenue prospects are bright. (See also: Amazon and Google: By the Numbers) Morgan Stanley estimates that the average Prime customer spends close to $2500 a year, and NYU professor Galloway said this number could reach $7000, which would propel Amazon to the $1 trillion mark. The inability of the retail sector to pivot and adapt to the changing times makes them sitting ducks for the online giant. ""They just don’t know it yet. There are more cashiers in the U.S. than there are teachers,"" Galloway said. ""And now, I’m in a lot of boardrooms of retail companies, and they’re all using the term ‘optimize their stores,’ which is code for ‘fire people.’ Everyone looks to Amazon for leadership.""

According to a Bloomberg report, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google is gearing up to provide ""Diagnostics-as-a-Service"" capabilities through its cloud division. The service will analyze reams of patient and disease data to diagnose patients and, possibly, recommend appropriate drugs for treatment.

International Business Machine Corporation's (IBM) Watson, which uses a mix of artificial intelligence and cloud computing on the back end, analyzed medical data and images pertaining to 1,000 cancer patients last year and returned diagnoses that concurred with a human doctor's assessment in 99 percent of all cases. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), which is a leader in cloud computing, lists genomic sequencing as one of the most prominent use cases of its service on its site.

Healthcare spending on cloud services reached $3.73 billion in 2015 and is expected to increase to $9.5 billion by 2020.

For example, telemedicine is rapidly gaining ground as a means to cut down on redundant costs associated with doctor visits for minor ailments. Medical diagnosis using cloud computing is a relatively new use case. And it might be a while before the diagnostic use case becomes a reality. This is because such diagnoses requires healthcare providers to release critical data to cloud computing companies. A mix of regulatory and competitive advantage considerations may prevent them from doing so.

Mark Kolakowski,06152017,Investopedia,06082017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Short interest in the so-called FAANG tech stocks reached $27.66 billion on Monday, and nervous investors who placed these bearish bets enjoyed a two-day mark-to-market gain of $1.62 billion, or 5.86%, during the tech pullback on Friday and Monday, according to a June 13 research report from S3 Partners LLC. The FAANG stocks include Facebook Inc. (FB), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google. In their analysis, S3 Partners included both the Alphabet Inc. Class A shares (GOOGL) and the Class C shares (GOOG). As a sign of growing bearish sentiment, short interest in the FAANG stocks as a group increased by a net $5.42 billion over the 30 days ending on June 12, per S3 Partners. Apple led the group with a $4.67 billion increase in short interest, while short interest declined for Facebook and Netflix. As a point of comparison, short interest in the 10 most shorted non-FAANG tech stocks reached $23.99 billion on Monday, and the mark-to-market gain during the two-day tech selloff on this group of shorts was only 0.56%, S3 Partners calculates.  As S3 Partners analyzed the situation, the largest and most popular holdings, most notably the FAANG stocks, were the most likely candidates for selling by long investors who wanted ""to not only reduce their market exposure, but also to realize profits before they vaporized."" Furthermore, S3 Partners finds that the tech downdraft on June 9 and 12 was the result of selling by long investors, and was not produced by a sudden surge in short interest that drove down prices. Short interest in the FAANG stocks increased by only $187 million, or 0.78%, from June 8 to 12, per S3 Partners, and this was only 0.29% of the $64.6 billion in aggregate trading volume for these stocks during the two-day selloff. When tech rebounds, S3 Partners expects that long investors again will concentrate their buying in the FAANG stocks. For the year to date through June 12, shorting the FAANG stocks has proved to be a losing bet, producing a $3.5 billion mark-to-market loss per S3 Partners' calculations. (For more, see also: Tech Stocks May Be Both Cheap--and Risky.) Looking all stocks in the very broad-based S&P 1500 Index, also known as the S&P Composite Index, Bespoke Investment Group identified the 25 most heavily shorted stocks as of May 31. While S3 Partners calculated the market value of short interest, Bespoke looked at short interest strictly in terms of the number of shares, and selected the 25 stocks with largest percentages of short interest relative to their shares of floating stock. These percentages ranged from 31.98% to 50.92%. None of the tech stocks analyzed by S3 Partners were on Bespoke's list. For the month to date through June 13, only four of the 25 stocks on Bespoke's list were down. In fact, 19 beat the gain on the S&P 1500 over the same period, per Bespoke's calculations. While short interest in high-flying tech stocks is driven by concerns that they are due for a correction, short interest in struggling retailers results from concerns about their long-term viability. Nonetheless, some of the bears have not done well lately. Department store Dillard's Inc. (DDS) and upscale hamburger chain Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK) top Bespoke's list, both with short interest as a percentage of float that exceeds 50%. In addition to Dillard's, this list also includes seven other brick-and-mortar retailers: general merchandiser Fred's Inc. (FRED), Restoration Hardware parent RH (RH), Big 5 Sporting Goods Corp. (BGFV), department store JC Penney Co.Inc. (JCP), household durable goods lessor Rent-A-Center Inc. (RCII), fashion retailer Stein Mart Inc. (SMRT) and closeout store Big Lots Inc. (BIG).

Momentum Machines, the Google (GOOGL)-backed startup that specializes in building these high-tech, artificial intelligence-powered devices, has just secured over $18 million of new venture capital, according to an SEC filing. San Francisco-based Momentum Machines debuted its prototype burger-making machine in 2012, eliciting awe from tech geeks and criticism from employment activists. It’s not hard to understand why: the startup’s robots can grill a beef patty, layer it with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onion, before putting it in a bun and wrapping it up to go 400 times in an hour — a feat that no human could ever hope to achieve. This revelation prompted former McDonald's (MCD) CEO Ed Rensi to tell Fox Business last year that these machines could provide a huge boost to fast food chains, particularly as the industry is under pressure due to rising minimum wages. ""It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries,” he said.

Verizon wishes Mayer well in her future endeavors,” the company said in the release.  (See also: Verizon to Lay Off 1,000 Across AOl, Yahoo: Report.) The departure of Mayer once the acquisition was complete was long expected given the downturn at the former internet giant during her four years at the helm.

Nathan Reiff,06152017,Investopedia,06082017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs In the financial world, what goes up (usually) must come down. That is why some prominent investors have made a career out of predicting when stocks that are apparently on a stratospheric rise will reach their maximum price and begin to decline. These traders focus on short-selling, or making money off of bets that companies will see their stock prices drop. One of the most highly-publicized and successful short-sellers in recent years is Andrew Left, a trader from Citron Research. Left rose to prominence by successfully shorting pharmaceuticals giant Valeant (VRX), accurately predicting when the company would see its shares plunge in value. Now, Left has his sights set on another company: the computer chip manufacturer Nvidia. Nvidia  (NVDA) has seen a recent price boom, with shares tripling in value in the past 12 months or so. Together, this performance has constituted the strongest return of any stock in the S&P 500 for that period, according to CNBC. It was pushing $180 per share prior to Citron's public prediction, made via Twitter, that the stock would see its value plunge to $130 per share. When Citron issued that prediction late last week, Nvidia prices dropped by 8% in response, although they had previously been up about 5% in the days just prior. In a public post called ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors,"" researches from Citron suggested that investors should ""take your profits and move on to Google (GOOGL).

In the recent frenzy in NVIDIA shares, it has added more to its market cap than the total valuation of its competitor AMD. Now it is fueled by an irresponsibly bullish number from Citi."" Should Citron's prediction come about and NVDA shares drop to $130, the result would be a price decline of about 20%. Left stood by his prediction in an interview with CNBC, calling NVDA ""no longer a stock,"" but rather ""a casino."" Unlike some other famous shorts, in which companies have been found out to be scams or frauds and the stocks have collapsed as a result, Left was careful to point out that ""of course Nvidia is not a fraud or a scam. It's a wonderful company. But unfortunately it got way ahead of itself."" Left indicated in the interview that he is currently short shares of the company. At the same time, Citi Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and UBS have each lifted their price targets on the company, indicating a widespread bullish opinion among the big banks.

Todd Haselton,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"Apple has struggled to make Siri as smart as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa because of disagreements among its staff and its decisions to limit how long it stores user data, former Apple employees told The Wall Street Journal. Apple unveiled a new version of Siri during its WWDC keynote address on Monday but failed to show the world how it's much better than competing products from Google and Amazon. There are a few areas where blame can be placed. The Journal said Apple keeps data for only six months while Google and Amazon continue to hold on to it, learning more and more about specific users as they continue to use the personal assistants. That means Siri has less information to query when it tries to predict what a user wants. The Journal said Apple employees have struggled with company leaders, who have resisted allowing Siri to fully tap into third party apps, among other things. It's certainly a major paint point: A user can only access select apps pre-approved by Apple using Siri. One might book a reservation at a restaurant using OpenTable, for example, which is approved by Apple. That same user can't ask Siri to play music through Spotify, which competes with Apple Music. Alexa and Google Assistant don't have those limitations. This has led to all sorts of shake-ups, including two co-founders who left Apple and created another start-up, Viv Labs, which was acquired by Samsung. The Journal said two other Siri employees landed at Google and Amazon. Competitors are starting to creep right onto Apple's turf, too. Google recently launched Google Assistant for iPhone, which we put head-to-head with Siri. While it's not the newest version of Siri that will launch this fall, Google Assistant was much more valuable and accurate than Siri in our tests. Amazon has started to bring Alexa to smartphones, too. While competitors may be smarter than Siri, Apple may still be able to come out on top among consumers who care more about privacy than they do accurate answers from voice assistants. Strong loyalty to Apple's universe is another factor. Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Read the full The Wall Street Journal report here.

The company recently hired an engineer named Manu Gulati from Apple, according to Variety. Gulati has at least 15 Apple patents related to chip design under his belt and will be key in Google's plan to build its own processors, Variety said. Apple currently builds its own smartphone processors but Google does not. Apple's newest A10X chips, for example, are built-in house instead of by companies like Intel or Qualcomm. Qualcomm currently supplies its Snapdragon processor for Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Gulati's LinkedIn profile says he's now Google's ""lead SOC architect."" SoC stands for ""system on a chip."" Gulati worked at Apple for almost 8 years as a micro-architect and has also been employed by Broadcom and AMD. If Google begins building processors in house, like Apple, it would potentially cut down on Google's reliance on Qualcomm. That may not be a big hit for Qualcomm, at least not yet, since the company still provides millions of its Snapdragon processors to smartphone makers such as Samsung, LG, HTC and others. Still, this is a significant trend in the smartphone market.

As a rule, growth stocks this year are technology, consumer discretionary, and health care. As a rule, value stocks this year are financials, energy, and consumer staples. It shouldn't surprise you that the reason growth has outperformed value is because of the huge outperformance of big-cap tech stocks. Here are the top holdings in the S&P Growth Index, by their weight in the index. S&P Growth: top holdingsApple: 7 percentMicrosoft: 4.8 percentAmazon: 3.4 percentFacebook: 3.1 percentGoogle: 2.6 percent These are the so-called ""FANG"" stocks (with Microsoft added) that everyone has been talking about this year. By contrast, the Value index's biggest names are energy and financials, which have all underperformed this year: For the past two days, we have seen a rotation out of tech outperformers and into energy and bank underperformers. This is a healthy sign: rather than just selling off, investors are using these over-owned technology names as a source of funds to buy underperforming energy and bank names. Will that continue? Opinions are divided. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, splits the difference by telling clients, ""We are not advising a style tilt at this point"" but notes the obvious: ""On a short-term basis, value's underperformance is moving to an extreme and due for a reprieve."" The good news is that the action in the past couple days is a good reminder that nothing goes in a straight line and the momentum guys can just as quickly abandon growth names, and have done so many times in the past. And growth does not have a monopoly on price appreciation: there are long periods when value does outperform. Lerner notes that while growth has outperformed value this year, growth underperformed value by 9 percent in 2016. ""Thus, over the entire period from 2016 until now, growth's outperformance is less extreme at less than 4%,"" Lerner notes. One final note: a common complaint about growth vs. value investing is that you get a lot of ""bleed,"" that is, because the parameters of what constitutes value and growth are a bit fuzzy, you can (and do) get stocks that have characteristics of both, so they are usually included in both indices. For example, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson are in both the Growth and Value indices. If this bothers you—that you can get the same stocks in two different investment styles that seem, well, opposite—you're not alone. There have been numerous attempts to create ""pure"" investment styles. Sticking with ETFs, one example is Guggenheim's S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) and S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) ETFs. Guggenheim splits the S&P into three groups: a growth basket that weights stocks on traditional growth fundamentals (sales and earnings growth, price momentum), a value basket that weights value stocks on traditional value fundamentals (price/book ratio, sales/price ratio, and earnings/price ratio), and a ""blend basket"" of stocks that have both growth & value attributes. It throws out the ""blend basket"" and creates funds that they believe how ""purer"" growth and value characteristics. The results? It sounds like a good idea, but at least this year there's not a huge difference between the performances of the S&P 500 Growth and Value and the ""Pure"" S&P 500 Growth and Value Indices: iShares S&P Growth (IVW) up 12.5 percentGuggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) up 12.8 percent iShares S&P Value (IVE) up 4.1 percent Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV) up 3.8 percent The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity.

Sam Meredith,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"China's Google-backed artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, Mobvoi, could soon take on the world's leading smart voice assistant technologies, according to the firm's founder and CEO. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Shanghai, Mobvoi's Li Zhifei told CNBC that the firm could ""absolutely"" compete with the likes of Amazon in the digital voice assistant market space. ""We are just like Amazon's Echo … We are making our own device and putting the technology into this device but gradually we are also going to open this AI service into third parties so that we can empower more devices,"" Li Zhifei told CNBC on Thursday. In Western markets, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana are the dominant voice assistants. Amazon has continued to push Alexa across numerous products, while Google has rolled out Assistant across Android devices and its own Google Home device. Even Apple came out with its own smart speaker called HomePod this week. Though Mobvoi's CEO acknowledged his signature chatbot device still has long way to go in order to improve its sophistication and compete on a global scale, he stressed the company was making a ""huge amount of progress"" in its development. The Beijing-based start-up was founded by a group of former Google research scientists five years ago and gained prominence after launching its flagship smartwatch, Ticwatch, in June 2015. The watch's success led to a direct investment from Google and by May 2017, Mobvoi unveiled Tichome, its Chinese language chatbot designed to facilitate human-machine interaction. ""In the last few years we have made a huge amount of progress in speaker recognition but we haven't made much progress in natural language understanding, which makes the device not that smart (yet),"" he added.

Tae Kim,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"Wall Street is getting jittery over FANG stocks. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham told investors he is growing increasingly concerned about the valuations of the large-cap tech bellwethers in a note to clients Thursday. As a result, he lowered his rating for Alphabet to hold from buy, saying the shares are ""expensive by historical standards.""  FANG shares are crushing the market this year. Facebook is up 31 percent, Amazon is up 30 percent, Netflix is up 23 percent, and Alphabet is up 22 percent year to date compared with the S&P 500's 9 percent return.""We still largely believe in the growth [of FANG], but the valuations are a bit less obvious. That said, we still believe the group should reward investors, but we are taking a step back on GOOGL,"" Graham wrote in the report.The analyst reaffirmed his $1,000 price target for Alphabet, representing 3 percent upside from Wednesday's close. The company's stock reached the $1,000 level for the first time ever last week. For Google ""the really easy growth for this ad business has sort of passed us by over the last two years,"" Graham said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Thursday. ""Looking out past 2018 I think growth might get a little tougher … Facebook, Amazon, Netflix all have more dynamic upside in our view."" The analyst gave three key reasons for his downgrade: 1. ""We think much of the growth over the past two years is due to ad load increases on mobile search and YouTube, which (especially the former) will be hard to repeat."" 2. ""Our refreshed detailed segment analysis suggests firmly that consensus gross margin estimates are too high, and while revenue growth mostly makes up for this, we believe this limits the potential for upward EPS revisions."" 3. ""GOOGL's P/E multiple of ~24x is expensive by historical standards, and puts the stock within a pitching wedge of our $1,000 price target."" FANG is an acronym created by CNBC's Jim Cramer for a basket of high-growth technology stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google). Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. The company's shares were down 1.7 percent at midday Thursday.

Jordan Novet,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"A major report released Thursday on the state of the public cloud industry includes Alibaba's cloud for the first time. The report from IT research group Gartner suggests that while China-based Alibaba is new to international markets, it's still well-positioned to compete with bigger players in the market, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google. In terms of ability to execute, Alibaba is ranked No. 4, ahead of IBM and Oracle, among others. But in terms of completeness of vision, it's behind both IBM and Oracle, as well as the top three vendors of cloud infrastructure, which companies can use to host their applications. Alibaba Group established its cloud in 2009, three years after Amazon introduced market-leading Amazon Web Services, Gartner analysts Lydia Leong, Raj Bala, Craig Lowery and Dennis Smith wrote in the new report. Today the Alibaba Cloud leads the cloud infrastructure market in China, although it only launched its international offering, including an English-language web service, last year. Google and Microsoft both introduced their infrastructure as a service tool in 2012. Like other big providers, Alibaba Cloud has been setting up more data centers around the globe to handle other companies' computing workloads, while also coming out with new services. Still, the Alibaba Cloud isn't perfect. Alibaba's international offering ""has a limited track record, and does not have the full capabilities or performance of the China offering,"" the analysts wrote. It ""has very little in the way of unique differentiation compared to other hyperscale providers. Additionally, Alibaba Cloud's vision seems inextricably tied to that of its global competitors; it takes liberal inspiration from competitors when developing service capabilities and branding."" On top of that, international customers could have security or compliance worries that stem from relying on a Chinese company, the analysts wrote. In addition to raw cloud infrastructure, Alibaba also provides software that companies can use to operate clouds in their own data centers, the analysts wrote. This is also true of Microsoft. Other new entrants in Gartner's 2017 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service include Interoute, Oracle and Skytap, along with Joyent, which Samsung acquired last year. Unlike Alibaba, fellow Chinese cloud operator Tencent was not included in this year's Gartner report. ","Gartner says Alibaba Cloud ready to take on Amazon, Microsoft, Google"
John Shinal,06152017,CNBC,06082017,"The sales to Softbank, the Japanese conglomerate owned by billionaire investor Masayoshi Son, show that the fiscal discipline Porat has brought to Google's parent company extends even to its most high-profile technologies. Her focus on the bottom line has reportedly earned Porat the nickname 'Ruth Vader' at the company, after the Star Wars arch-villain of the same name. While Porat's cost-cutting regime may put fear into the hearts of engineers dreaming of the distant future, it's been music to the ears of Alphabet investors focused on this year's market returns. One of the companies sold this week, Boston Dynamics, has built a group of robots that can run up stairs, leap over obstacles and bounce back from a swift kick as good as any human, as shown by their massively-popular YouTube videos. Clips that showcase different members of the cutting-edge metal crew, who have hip names like WildCat, Spot and Atlas, have garnered more than 76 million views on the Alphabet-owned video service. Another robot, called Cheetah, can sprint slightly faster than Usain Bolt, the Jamaican Olympic champion known as the world's fastest human. As interesting as its robots may be to online viewers, though, any market for them is still between nascent and speculative. Alphabet's robot division was put together four years ago in a flurry of acquisitions by Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile operating system that today generates a large chunk of Google's ad sales. Yet Rubin left Google a year later, leaving behind more than a half-dozen companies located in multiple countries, reportedly bereft of leadership or a coherent vision. Enter Porat, a former executive with the giant investment bank Morgan Stanley, to clean up the financial mess. Less than a year after she arrived, Boston Dynamics was reportedly on the chopping block. Porat said at the Code technology conference last week that she and other top Alphabet executives meet weekly to evaluate the company's more speculative businesses, which it calls Other Bets. Less than a week later, Boston Dynamics and another company called Schaft joined a long and growing list of companies that have been sold or scaled back since Porat arrived. Her tenure has been a boon to Alphabet shareholders, with its stock up more than 70 percent since she joined, far outpacing the gain of the broader market for tech shares. In the first quarter, Alphabet's net income surged 29 percent, to $5.4 billion. If the engineers of Boston Dynamics wanted to keep getting funded out of those profits in the Porat era, they perhaps should have taught Cheetah or Atlas how to develop a go-to-market strategy.

And, until Friday, investors were buying the stocks in tandem, but as we learned, that can be risky. Read:  What sparked the Nasdaq’s worst two-session, tech-fueled rout in 9 months Fair warning A few weeks ago I warned my clients that this buying could continue, but because of the focused nature of the rally, any selling in FAANG stocks could cause eye-opening declines without hurting the broader market. My warning fell on deaf ears because the buying did not stop until Friday. Interestingly, the buying may not stop for long even after this recent setback. The European Central Bank (ECB) continues to print the equivalent of about $60 billion a month, and the money needs to go somewhere. Reasonably, the focus may no longer be on this select few stocks, like it seemed to be all year, but the fabricated liquidity is still flowing. Central bank capital infusions dating back to 2013 are exactly what caused this asset bubble, and the liquidity injections have not stopped. This bubble will burst, but probably not today, and the recent selling in FAANG stocks does not appear to be a precursor to an impending market crash. Looking at the stocks as a group, their influence on the market is tangible, but they have very different relative valuation metrics. For example, Facebook has an immediate and relatively exceptional valuation while Amazon is at the other end, and has virtually no value at these prices. In between, Apple lacks immediate value, while Netflix is fairly valued, and Google will likely demonstrate an oddity in earnings growth in calendar 2017 that will not be resolved until 2018, distorting its immediate fair value. Read: Apple’s stock set to snap longest streak above key chart level in over 6 years Liquidity is (almost) everything All told, these stocks absolutely have had strong influence on the market. Still, their cohesive relationship is likely to come to an end as a result of the recent tech fallout, but this is not the beginning of a market crash. This could be a precursor to a crash that begins in the months ahead, but that all depends on liquidity. I will, of course, continue to monitor that closely and communicate everything that I see to clients. For now, the money is flowing like water, and it will need a home; asset-buying interest has not stopped. Fair-value charts As far as the stocks’ fair value, I have provided details on each one with corresponding graphs and charts to help you understand their differences, and the difference in their fair-value assessments accordingly.

Since the “Trump rally” faded in March, energy, financial, and industrial stocks, which Wall Street dubbed the likeliest winners from President Trump’s supposedly “pro-growth” policies, passed the baton back to the previous leaders—the FANGS, plus Apple, which got a second wind this year. Those stocks, which ruled last year’s “Hillary Clinton stock market,” sucked all the oxygen out of the room because they were posting huge revenue and earnings growth in a slow-growing economy. Over the past four years, Facebook soared 544%, Amazon surged 268%, Apple gained 170%, Netflix advanced 441%, and Alphabet rose 124%.

Unfortunately, though these are all great companies that dominate rapidly growing markets, I think their stocks’ recent big run is coming to an end. When super-momentum stocks like these break down, they fall hard and may take years to recover their former glory. So, unless the FAANGs hit new highs again on strong volume in the next few weeks, I’m afraid their investors—including many newbies and fan boys and girls—are in for some pain. Why? Because we’ve seen this movie before, most recently two years ago, when the super-momentum stocks of that period — biotechs — peaked and then plummeted. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF

Then, too, Wall Street and fund managers saw nothing but blue skies ahead because of their great breakthrough therapies and attractiveness as acquisition targets for Big Pharma. But they lost more than a third of their value over the next seven months and, nearly two years later, that ETF is still 23% off its peak. The FAANGs may turn out to be more resilient, but the biotechs’ fate is a cautionary tale. And biotech stocks were nowhere near as central to the market as the FAANGs are today. “The FAANG stocks now account for 11.9% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, up from 5.8% on April 26, 2013,” Ed Yardeni wrote last week. “Collectively, over this period, they’ve accounted for $1.6 trillion of the $6.9 trillion increase in the S&P 500!” Read: Apple downgraded by Mizuho, the second ratings cut in a week Their recent market capitalization of $2.4 trillion is about 13% of GDP, the New York Times reported, and retail investors own 60% to 70% of their shares through mutual funds, ETFs and direct ownership—“an exposure of very large amounts of money to a small selection of stocks that investment specialists say is unprecedented,” The Times wrote. And yet Wall Street is still cheering them on, because, hey, they have nowhere to go but up, right? “At this point, the so-called FANG stocks that have led the market to new highs look unstoppable,” wrote Joe Ciolli in Business Insider a couple of weeks ago. Even famed value investors—value investors!—have capitulated and now worship at the altar of momentum and growth. All hail the FAANGs! The top holding in Bill Nygren’s venerable Oakmark Select Fund is Alphabet, the Times reported, while Chris Davis, best known as an investor in financial stocks, has Amazon as the biggest position in his Davis New York Venture Fund. The Times quoted analyst Julian Brigden, who acknowledged the FAANGs could be in a mania phase but added, “You have no choice but to be sucked into the trade.” Doesn’t that remind you of Chuck Prince, Citigroup’s hapless CEO, who said on the eve of the financial crisis, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance”? Read: Has Apple’s stock finally run out of steam? This may be only a correction, and the FAANGs may scale even greater heights. But their collapse would pose the biggest challenge to the eight-year-old bull market since oil prices hit bottom in February 2016. New leaders would have to emerge to limit this to a normal sector rotation, not a full-fledged bear like the one that followed the dot.com meltdown of 2000. Read: Is Tesla a buy? 7 reasons it is – and 7 reasons it isn’t This long bull probably has one last big inning left and, as I said, these are great companies and likely great future stock-market performers. You might be able to buy them later at much lower prices. But if you’ve made big profits from the FAANGs, either directly or indirectly, I’d take some money off the table, hold the rest, and lower your expectations big time. And if you’re thinking of investing in these superhigh flyers at this late date, I have one word of advice for you: Don’t. Howard R.

It must be conceded that Berkshire’s long-running Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger show is unlike any of the meetings that publicly traded companies must convene annually to comply with securities law. And neither Tesla nor Alphabet have as long a history. Read: Warren Buffett is better in person — skip the webcast and schlep to Omaha But Berkshire shouldn’t have a monopoly on excitement. Both Alphabet and Tesla have tremendous potential to turn their shareholder meetings into learning experiences for young people. Beyond requirements that only registered shareholders can vote, companies can develop their own procedures. Unlike many others, Berkshire welcomes the press. Berkshire, Tesla and Google all provide real-time video of the event. But the trio aren’t alike in how they interact with shareholders. Buffett and Munger spent six hours answering shareholders’ questions. Eric Schmidt, Alphabet’s executive chairman, answered all questions put to him by those in the auditorium during the far-briefer meeting Tesla CEO Elon Musk took no questions from the floor, unlike last year, although he did answer 20 questions from tweets submitted in advance. In Omaha, eager shareholders arrive early and rush for the best seats when the doors open. It was more sedate at Tesla and Alphabet — no rush, plenty of spare seats. At Tesla, Musk is a rock star, just like Buffett is with his investors. When he walked onstage, dressed in jeans, collared shirt and blazer, enthusiasts jumped to their feet in sustained applause. The crowd was a mix of young and old. Dozens of Tesla cars were outside. Like at Berkshire’s giant gathering, it was an audience of true believers, and a palpable buzz enveloped the small auditorium. Lawyer Renee Becker and her 19-year-old son Christian Rayfield were typical attendees. They had traveled from Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Christian is studying engineering and pushing his mom to purchase a Tesla. They had hoped to ask a question but didn’t get the chance. Three steelworkers from Oakland, Calif., and local union president Mike Miller also came, hoping to ask Musk questions about wages at the retooled Tesla solar roof tile factory in Buffalo, N.Y. Only two were admitted. The men only learned when they arrived that they were supposed to tweet questions in advance to even have a chance at a response, and their tweets from inside the meeting were ignored. By contrast, the scene at Google parent Alphabet was circumspect. There were no cheers for the 61-year-old Schmidt, who was dressed in a suit and tie. The small audience was older, a sharp contrast to the hundreds of youthful Googlers going about their business outside. The attendees appeared content with the windfall earnings they’ve reaped from a company that in only 18 years had become a powerful global brand. Both Musk and Schmidt delivered exciting, future-oriented presentations. Schmidt emphasized artificial intelligence and the new organizational structure of strong, independent subsidiaries he said was inspired by Warren Buffett. Whether the product is Google, YouTube, or Waymo (the company’s self-driving car project), Alphabet is “helping people live their lives, making lives more powerful,” he said. In his remarks, Musk said Tesla, which is on track to deliver its first affordable Model 3 next month, will unveil a semi-truck in September. It also will build a new plant to produce its next car model because Tesla’s sole assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., has reached full capacity. By combining solar shingles, a power wall in the garage, and an electric car, “Tesla is building an integrated future and providing a solution to the energy equation,” Musk said.

Alessandra Malito,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 13, 2017 11:26 a.m. ET Annual salary shares the No. 1 spot with another big consideration for workers By If you’re anything like the average American, the next time you look for a job, you won’t just be looking at how much that employer pays. Money is a No. 1 priority for job hunters with 71% of people saying it’s “very important,” but the same percentage also considers job stability just as important, according to a survey of more than 220,000 U.S. adults conducted by brand-tracking firm Morning Consult. More than just a salary, a majority of employees want good benefits, including a retirement plan and health insurance, career advancement opportunities, vacation days and to be a part of a company with a solid reputation. Companies are expanding employee benefits to address these needs. Following in the footsteps of Starbucks, the City of Memphis announced last week that it would help employees tackle crippling student debt. Other employers take a different approach to the perks they offer, such as days off to do your favorite outdoor activity, volunteer time, a traveling stipend and death benefits.

At the time, Uber said it was a case of bad timing and it did not mean to disrupt the temporary strike by taxis. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.)

Ryan Vlastelica,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 15, 2017 1:33 p.m. ET How markets today resemble those of 1999, when the seeds of an epic downturn were already sown By Investors who have been in the markets for at least 20 years can be forgiven if they’ve been feeling an unsettling sense of déjà vu lately. The recent selloff in technology shares on Wall Street—which began abruptly last week, although the sector is still the best-performing industry of 2017 at current levels—has drawn comparisons to the abrupt end of the original dot-com run-up, and not simply because it’s the same sector driving market direction, and because the same sector is facing the same charges of being overvalued. Read: As internet stocks hit records, familiar questions about bubbles arise “This is my 33rd year in capital markets, and what I’m seeing is very reminiscent of 1999,” said Mark Travis, chief executive officer of Intrepid Capital Funds. “Back then, it was the ‘Four Horsemen of the Nasdaq’ leading the market; today it’s the FANG stocks—there’s a similar level of concentration.” FANG refers to four internet names—Facebook

Other market metrics are eerily mirroring what happened in 1999, shortly before dot-com bubble burst and sparked a broad-based selloff, one so severe for tech that the sector only fully recovered earlier this year. The resemblance in conditions means that “from a big-picture perspective, the comparison to 1999 holds up remarkably well,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “1999 and 2017 do indeed bear more than a passing resemblance.” He added that “1999 was a good year, just as 2017 is shaping up to be a good year. With the wisdom of hindsight, though, we know that even as things were great, the seeds of the next downturn were already growing.” See also: Investors retreat from tech ETF despite series of records Don’t miss: Will tech rally continue? Hedge funds say yes, but mutual funds say no McMillan looked at the four economic indicators he deems most important for comparing market conditions across eras: consumer confidence, business confidence, jobs growth and the yield curve. All of them reflect trends that are today equal to or are even more extended than in that earlier era. More detail: Stop! This is not like the dot-com bubble — because, according to this chart, it’s much worse Of McMillan’s four indicators, perhaps the least troubling one is consumer confidence, which he said was “very high right now,” though “not as high as it was in 1999, to be sure.” “The path up looks similar. After several years of positive developments, people are feeling good, and they’re ready to act on it,” McMillan said. Business confidence, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management’s read on manufacturing, “is even higher now than it was in 1999,” a possible sign of a top. As to the metric that McMillan said was the “most important,” job growth “has closely tracked levels of the 1990s over the past several years. We did not get the early bump to quite the same degree, but the current growth pattern—and the slow decline in growth—looks much like the late 1990s.” The most recent payroll report showed a slowing in the number of jobs added. Finally, the yield curve suggests that “the economy might be even more inflated by monetary policy now than it was” in 1999, McMillan said. In its most recent meeting, completed on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and laid out a plan to shrink its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet starting “this year,” a pair of moves reflecting its view that an economic expansion now entering its ninth year no longer needs so much propping up. The following chart compares the S&P 500 over the past several years to the benchmark index in the years that preceded the end of the dot-com era. The similarity of the upward slopes in both suggests that “markets have responded to all of these factors in, again, very much the same way they did in the 1990s,” McMillan wrote. “In fact, late last year, we hit a market milestone: all the major U.S. stock indices hit record highs—something we hadn’t seen since Dec. 31, 1999.” ",Stocks continue to mirror the dot-com era in ominous ways - MarketWatch
Mike Murphy,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 13, 2017 7:39 a.m. ET Pair of tickets in Oakland sells for record $133,000, which would get you a nice home in Cleveland By Pop quiz: You’ve got a pile of cash to burn—do you buy a couple of seats that you’ll use for three hours, or a nice house? For one basketball fan, the answer was a no-brainer. A pair of courtside tickets to Monday’s Game 5 of the NBA Finals in Oakland—where the Golden State Warriors won their second championship in three years over the Cleveland Cavaliers—sold for a jaw-dropping $133,000, or more than twice the median price of a house in Cleveland. Eh, gotta have priorities. According to a report by ESPN, the tickets are a record price for an NBA game. The seats were resold by a season-ticket holder on the official NBATickets.com site, and generated $17,000 in fees for the site’s owner, Ticketmaster. And while those may be the most expensive seats in the house, there are others not far behind. ESPN reported pairs of courtside seats also resold online for $90,000 and $82,000. Courtside seats for the finals at Oakland’s Oracle Arena had a face value of around $3,000 each. Regular seats were no bargain either. The average resale ticket price for the game was $1,731, ESPN reported, up about 20% from last year’s finals, which averaged $1,444. According to Zillow Inc., the median price of a house in Cleveland is $64,900. That compares to Oakland’s median home price of $599,000—which is still relatively cheap compared with the rest of the Bay Area. And hey, don’t knock Cleveland—its river hasn’t caught fire in years, and it has recently been named one of the best places to live in the U.S. So, instead of sitting close enough for Steph Curry’s sweat to drip on you (sure, a selling point for some, but less so for others), here are a few houses in Cleveland that you could have bought instead of those courtside seats: $82,000 budget: How about this charming four-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Cleveland’s Tremont neighborhood for $74,900? It’s 2,176 square feet and needs a bit of TLC, but there’s a downstairs rental property to generate some extra cash. As a bonus, it’s just a few blocks away from the “Christmas Story” house. $90,000 budget: Snap up this three-bedroom, two-bathroom, move-in ready 1,200-square-foot home in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood for $87,500. The basement’s big enough for a man cave or a fourth bedroom. $133,000 budget: You could get this four-bedroom, two-bathroom 1,800-square-foot colonial in the Kamm’s Corner neighborhood just under budget, at $132,000. It features beautiful hardwood floors, a spacious attic and a bar in the partially finished garage. It’s also got a huge, fenced backyard and a one-car garage. On the other hand, fans at Game 5 got a free Warriors T-shirt. See, it’s all about priorities. ","For the price of these NBA Finals courtside tickets, you could have bought a house - MarketWatch"
Mark DeCambre,06152017,MarketWatch,06082017,"Published: June 15, 2017 11:23 a.m. ET Can the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge past 22,000 — this year? By Prominent market technician Ralph Acampora thinks the stock market, and specifically the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has more than 7% left to climb by the end of the year, if the technology sector doesn’t buckle under the weight of persistent worries about valuations. Acampora, an analyst whom some have dubbed the godfather of technical analysis for his role in bringing to prominence techniques using charts and other technical tools to underpin investing strategies, told MarketWatch recently that he maintains a sanguine outlook for Wall Street, despite recent convulsions in the technology sector, and is forecasting that the Dow

The market technician said the one proviso is that highflying technology names, which enjoyed a respite in the green on Tuesday after a two-session beatdown, stay above their recently minted lows. “As far as technology is concerned, as long as we stay above the lows that were made [Monday] in Facebook and Google, as long as we hold those levels and don’t roll over, we are all right,” Acampora said.

They’re getting parabolic—they have been for a while,” Acampora said, referring to the steep rise in the value of the technology sector over the past few years (see chart below, which shows the spectacular rise of Nvidia’s shares): That said, parabolic patterns sustain for an extended period, the market technician said, particularly if Friday and Monday’s sudden jolt lower represented a cathartic pullback that allows for further gains. The director of technical analysis for investment fund Altaira Ltd. of London, Acampora said his optimism also is tied to what some have described as a healthy rotation into other sectors of the market, even as tech took a hit. He also pointed to the rise in shares of small-cap companies, which tend to prosper when investors maintain an upbeat economic outlook. “The lifeline of a bull market is a rotation, and that’s what we’re getting here, and that’s healthy,” he said. However, valuations may remain a nagging matter in tech, with investors debating whether the sector is approaching bubble territory. A Capital Economics research report on Monday made the case that, on a relative basis, tech isn’t as rich as some might fear, given that Amazon trades at a price-to-earnings ratio—one popular measure of a stock’s market valuation—of 182 times, compared with an S&P 500 average P/E of 22 times. “Nonetheless, the valuations of shares in the technology sector do not seem to be stretched relative to those in the broader market, based on a comparison of their price [vs.] estimated operating earnings ratios. This is quite different to the situation before the dot-com bubble burst, when the valuations of technology companies often appeared to have little to do with their ability to generate income,” John Higgins, chief market economist at Capital Economics, wrote. To be sure, the Capital Economics report doesn’t maintain a bullish outlook on the overall stock market because the firm contends that companies’ abilities to squeeze out profit in the future is limited. Meanwhile, investors are increasingly worried that U.S. equities are overvalued, with a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey indicating that a record 44% of investors polled now see stocks as pricey. That’s up from 37% last month. That survey also indicates that 38% of investors see the Nasdaq Composite as the most overcrowded trade so far in June. “Market vulnerability to profit weakness is very high,” said Michael Hartnett, B. of A. Merrill Lynch’s chief investment strategist, “with investors’ perception of excess valuation coinciding with high global profit expectations.” Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

Kent Walker, general counsel at Google, said Sunday the U.S. technology giant is ""committed to being part of the solution"" to tackling online extremist content. ""Terrorism is an attack on open societies, and addressing the threat posed by violence and hate is a critical challenge for us all,"" Walker wrote in a blog post. ""There should be no place for terrorist content on our services."" The four new steps are: The latest measures build upon Google's previous efforts to fight extremist content on its platform amid a broader criticism of internet companies from politicians. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May urged technology companies to do more to tackle online extremism following the Manchester Arena bombing last month. May, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, even said they would look at proposals to fine internet companies that fail to take down such content. Google admitted that the problem of fighting terrorist content online is tough, but said it is committed to doing more. ""Extremists and terrorists seek to attack and erode not just our security, but also our values; the very things that make our societies open and free. We must not let them,"" Walker said. ""Together, we can build lasting solutions that address the threats to our security and our freedoms. It is a sweeping and complex challenge. We are committed to playing our part.""

In the U.S. on desktop and mobile, when a user searches for ""jobs near me"" or something similar, results will surface from a number of different websites. Users are able to filter jobs by a number of different criteria and there will be reviews and ratings of the employer from trusted sites next to a description of the role. If you are signed in to Google, you can also see how long your commute would be from home. ""With this new experience, we aim to connect Americans to job opportunities across the U.S., so no matter who you are or what kind of job you're looking for, you can find job postings that match your needs,"" Nick Zakrasek, product manager at Google, said in a blog post on Tuesday. Google has also built in an alert feature that sends notifications when a new job is posted. The search results use a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning to sift through, categorize, and then throw up the jobs postings from all the different sites. LinkedIn, Monster, WayUp, DirectEmployers, CareerBuilder, Glassdoor and Facebook, are some of the partners Google is working on for this project. And the search giant has also posted instructions that allow organizations to make sure their job posts come up in Google. The new search results are part of the ""Google for Jobs"" initiative at the company which aims to match job seekers with employers. Google, however, isn't trying to directly compete with the likes of Monster or LinkedIn. It has no intention of letting employers directly post job openings on its search engine, according to an interview Zakrasek gave to TechCrunch on Tuesday.

Karen Gilchrist,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Google could be slapped with a fine of more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) as the EU begins the first stage of a three-pronged probe into the search group's practices, the Financial Times reported. In the coming weeks, EU officials are expected to say that the tech company, which is owned by Alphabet, abused its search market dominance to give its Google Shopping service an advantage over other retailers. It comes as part of Brussels' wider antitrust investigation into Google. If enacted, the fine is expected to break the record for a monopoly abuse case, topping the 1 billion (then $1.45 billion) fine handed out to chipmaker Intel in 2009, the FT said, citing two people familiar with the case. The fine will be capped at a maximum of 10 percent of Alphabet's total revenues, which stood at $90 billion last year. It would mark the first sanction by a leading competition regulator into the company's search practices.

The investment comes at a time of rising interest in cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, which recently hit a record high and has seen a massive rally since the start of the year. Blockchain has created a bitcoin wallet which is essentially a piece of software to store the digital currency and carry out transactions with other users. The money will be used to expand the team further and invest in more research and development, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, told CNBC on Thursday. In addition, the start-up is looking to open new offices in different countries to expand. Smith said that the recent rally in bitcoin has caused high demand for Blockchain's wallet product, and the funding will help to meet that. ""We are really focused on scaling to meet the record demand we are getting in the market,"" Smith told CNBC in a phone interview. ""We started raising this round before the run up in the cryptomarket. It was good timing in the end because while we were closing the round, we were massively up on every level. Our traffic has been growing 15 percent week over week in last two weeks."" Blockchain has nearly 15 million sign-ups with ""billions of dollars worth of monthly consumer wallet activity"", Smith said, adding this includes deposits and transactions. Gross revenue is forecast to be more than 1,000 percent year-over-year in June, Smith added, but could not disclose the specific figure.

YouTube and rival Facebook are racing to improve AI-powered technology that spots things like racism and other hate speech in their online videos, including content used by terrorists for recruiting. But as part of Google, YouTube may have an advantage, as Google is making a big bet on AI — enough that CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an ""AI-first"" company. Both companies are moving toward an entertainment industry business model by paying to produce content which they can use to sell video ads. As they do, however, they've faced criticism from European leaders whose citizens have been killed in terrorist attacks. YouTube also suffered a backlash from advertisers worried about the safety of their brands next to distasteful videos. Facebook said last week it would use its own AI-powered software and hire more terrorist experts after leaders of the U.K. and France threatened new laws to punish companies whose content stays online long enough for terrorists to spread their message. Facebook is hiring producers and putting together its own slate of shows, following YouTube into a market worth $500 billion a year. But both are finding their move to ape Hollywood carries risks.

If Google buys the parcels, it plans to build a campus of buildings with between 6 million and 8 million square feet of space for offices and worker housing near a commuter train station. Google, based in Mountain View near the northern edge of an area that's home to many of the world's largest tech firms, is looking 15 miles south for space as it struggles to keep up with its growth plans amid a severe regional housing shortage.

Christina Farr,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Seattle's prestigious Institute for Systems Biology has long been a draw for star experimental scientists. But it's now in a battle for talent with some deep-pocketed competitors: Amazon and Google. Out of a group of a dozen researchers, four have recently left for Amazon, Google and Microsoft, said Nathan Price, associate director of ISB, which is now owned by Providence Health & Services, a non-profit network of hospitals. Rather than fighting to hang onto the institute's standout biologists and bioinformaticists, Price has figured out a way to embrace the trend. ""We're asking talented researchers to come spend a few years with us, and develop something cool before they get recruited out,"" he told CNBC. Prized academics are in high demand by technology companies, which are racing to bring cloud computing and machine learning to the $3 trillion health care market. ISB, for instance, uses both Amazon Web Services and Google's cloud technology on various projects. As tech companies vie for contracts with large health systems to manage a growing volume of their most sensitive data, they need employees on board who understand specific topics like protein networks and gene networks, said Price. At ISB, which was co-founded by genetics pioneer Leroy ""Lee"" Hood, researchers bolster their scientific knowledge by taking engineering courses from services like education site Coursera, said Price. In the future, Price said that academic institutions will need to figure out a way to better compete with the industry. Currently, tech firms can pay so much more that he's losing talent even when scientists have little clarity about what they'll be doing. Alphabet's life sciences arm Verily hired one of his data scientists without providing specifics on the project, Price said. ""These people are really important to the future of what we want to do,"" he said. ""In academia, we need to close the gap more than we have been.""

Tae Kim,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"Wall Street is getting jittery over FANG stocks. Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham told investors he is growing increasingly concerned about the valuations of the large-cap tech bellwethers in a note to clients Thursday. As a result, he lowered his rating for Alphabet to hold from buy, saying the shares are ""expensive by historical standards.""  FANG shares are crushing the market this year. Facebook is up 31 percent, Amazon is up 30 percent, Netflix is up 23 percent, and Alphabet is up 22 percent year to date compared with the S&P 500's 9 percent return.""We still largely believe in the growth [of FANG], but the valuations are a bit less obvious.

The company's stock reached the $1,000 level for the first time ever last week. For Google ""the really easy growth for this ad business has sort of passed us by over the last two years,"" Graham said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Thursday. ""Looking out past 2018 I think growth might get a little tougher … Facebook, Amazon, Netflix all have more dynamic upside in our view."" The analyst gave three key reasons for his downgrade: 1. ""We think much of the growth over the past two years is due to ad load increases on mobile search and YouTube, which (especially the former) will be hard to repeat."" 2. ""Our refreshed detailed segment analysis suggests firmly that consensus gross margin estimates are too high, and while revenue growth mostly makes up for this, we believe this limits the potential for upward EPS revisions."" 3. ""GOOGL's P/E multiple of ~24x is expensive by historical standards, and puts the stock within a pitching wedge of our $1,000 price target.""

Jordan Novet,06222017,CNBC,06152017,"A major report released Thursday on the state of the public cloud industry includes Alibaba's cloud for the first time. The report from IT research group Gartner suggests that while China-based Alibaba is new to international markets, it's still well-positioned to compete with bigger players in the market, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google. In terms of ability to execute, Alibaba is ranked No. 4, ahead of IBM and Oracle, among others. But in terms of completeness of vision, it's behind both IBM and Oracle, as well as the top three vendors of cloud infrastructure, which companies can use to host their applications. Alibaba Group established its cloud in 2009, three years after Amazon introduced market-leading Amazon Web Services, Gartner analysts Lydia Leong, Raj Bala, Craig Lowery and Dennis Smith wrote in the new report. Today the Alibaba Cloud leads the cloud infrastructure market in China, although it only launched its international offering, including an English-language web service, last year. Google and Microsoft both introduced their infrastructure as a service tool in 2012. Like other big providers, Alibaba Cloud has been setting up more data centers around the globe to handle other companies' computing workloads, while also coming out with new services. Still, the Alibaba Cloud isn't perfect. Alibaba's international offering ""has a limited track record, and does not have the full capabilities or performance of the China offering,"" the analysts wrote. It ""has very little in the way of unique differentiation compared to other hyperscale providers. Additionally, Alibaba Cloud's vision seems inextricably tied to that of its global competitors; it takes liberal inspiration from competitors when developing service capabilities and branding."" On top of that, international customers could have security or compliance worries that stem from relying on a Chinese company, the analysts wrote. In addition to raw cloud infrastructure, Alibaba also provides software that companies can use to operate clouds in their own data centers, the analysts wrote. This is also true of Microsoft. Other new entrants in Gartner's 2017 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service include Interoute, Oracle and Skytap, along with Joyent, which Samsung acquired last year. Unlike Alibaba, fellow Chinese cloud operator Tencent was not included in this year's Gartner report. ","Gartner says Alibaba Cloud ready to take on Amazon, Microsoft, Google"

When it comes to online search, one company dominates like no other: Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). In the first quarter of 2017, the company commanded a 79% worldwide market share of desktop search and a stunning 96% in the mobile and tablet category according to netmarketshare.com. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has been called the ""Google of China"" and has followed its U.S. counterpart into a surprising number of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving. Baidu is the search leader on its home turf after Google abandoned China because of censorship in 2010. Baidu is considered to be among the forerunners in both AI and self-driving cars in its native China, but technologically, it lags Google in both. By extending its search to include voice, photo, and video and expanding its reach into virtual assistants, home speakers, and cars, the company hopes to step out of Google's shadow in the rest of the world. It believes its greatest hopes for topping Google lie in the realm of autonomous driving. Baidu wants to be the industry standard in autonomous driving. Image source: Baidu. Baidu believes that taking a page from the Google playbook might be its best chance at success. In an unexpected move last month, the company announced that it would open-source its autonomous driving technology in an initiative it called Project Apollo. The logic being that by making its self-driving car technology available to all comers, it has a shot at becoming the industry standard, much as Google did with its Android operating system in the cellphone market. Baidu plans to announce some of its first Project Apollo partners in early July. If that's the case, Baidu has its work cut out for it. Google launched its autonomous driving efforts back in 2009, and after eight years of research, Alphabet's Waymo division, which houses those efforts, may be readying the technology for commercial applications. Waymo recently announced a partnership with ride-hailing service Lyft to help bring its self-driving cars into the mainstream, which will expand beyond the limited locations where the technology has been tested. If this partnership proves successful, it could be a huge revenue generator for Waymo. Baidu believes its Apollo open platform will grow into an ecosystem and provide the catalyst for success. Baidu's chief operating officer, Qi Lu, has stated that Apollo will surpass any closed system in three to five years. Lu made another bold prediction, saying, ""If Apollo performs well, we will catch up with and even surpass Google."" Baidu believes its best chance to dethrone Google is in self-driving cars. Image source: Baidu. These developments come at a crucial time for the Chinese search giant. Baidu has been struggling with stagnant revenue in the face of increased advertising regulations in China. In its most recent quarter, the company saw online customers fall 23%, and earnings declined 11% year over year. It wasn't all bad news, as Baidu's remaining customers increased their spending to drive revenue higher by 6.8%. The company hopes that its focus on the future and heavy spending in the areas of autonomous driving and artificial intelligence will pave the way to future success. There's no denying that the company has made some bold moves, and its leadership at home is a testament to its successes. That said, it will take much more than the proclamations of some key executives to make it so. The open sourcing of its autonomous driving platform may pave the way to future success, and the company has been devoting an increasing number of resources to the development of AI. If Baidu can succeed in regaining its momentum in the area of online search, that will provide the resources necessary to compete in areas like autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.

"Steve Symington, Sean Williams, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos",06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Google -- now renamed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), following a restructuring in late 2015 -- has come a long way from its initial public offering in early 2004. Shares have climbed more than 1,600% over the past 13 years, as of this writing. And with Alphabet stock trading near an all-time high thanks to its latest stellar quarter, it's clear that the internet search juggernaut is as strong as ever. But are there any companies today that look similar to Google circa 2004? When we asked that question of three Motley Fool contributors, they offered iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and Square (NYSE:SQ) as shining Google-esque portfolio candidates. Read on to learn why. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Steve Symington (iRobot): It's been a while since iRobot's 2005 IPO. But there's a case to be made that, similar to Google in 2004, as far as growth is concerned, the home-robot specialist is only just getting started. Last quarter, for example, iRobot's revenue climbed 28.8% year over year to $168.5 million, including 32% growth in consumer robot revenue driven by strong demand in all regions for its high-end (and high-margin) Roomba 900 series robotic vacuums. iRobot also saw sales of its newer Braava floor-mopping robots nearly double to make up around 10% of total revenue, offering a much-desired bit of diversification for investors who are leery of the company's current reliance on Roomba. Much in the same way Google is expanding its reach with its ""other bets"" segment outside of the core internet search business, iRobot isn't stopping with its current product lines. In 2015, for example, iRobot revealed it was in the early stages of designing a differentiated robotic lawn mower, which itself could propel the company into a new multibillion-dollar market. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (TripAdvisor): Like Google in its early days as a public company, TripAdvisor is working hard to solve a search problem for a huge base of users. The company aims to help travelers enjoy the best possible trips by matching them to the locations, hotels, restaurants, and attractions that meet their unique needs. In its 2004 IPO letter, Google's management explained that it would always prioritize moves that maximized long-term growth. ""If opportunities arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results but are in the best long term interest of our shareholders,"" executives wrote at the time, ""we will take those opportunities."" TripAdvisor could be in the middle of just such a trade-off, given that its switch away from a per-click marketing model sent sales and profits slumping last year. The new instant-booking service drove sharp declines in its core hotel business even though management saw it as a critical step toward creating a world-class travel-shopping experience. There are signs that the bet is starting to pay off. Average hotel shopper revenue improved last quarter after six straight quarters of declines. The company believes profitability will begin improving, too, now that it's completed the move to a more mobile-friendly monetization strategy. If that pans out, there's a large potential market out there to attack. TripAdvisor's $1.5 billion of revenue is a tiny fraction of the $567 billion of annual online travel spending worldwide. That segment stands to log robust growth over many years as travelers transition to booking their own trips online. Sean Williams (Square): When I think of Google in 2004, I'm reminded of a burgeoning search and advertising powerhouse that had a clear path to dominant market share, but which still had a number of major competitors. A financial technology services company that I see in an intriguing parallel with Google from more than a decade ago is alternative-payment processor Square. The payment-processing industry is largely dominated by giants such as Visa and Mastercard, which have built their infrastructure up over decades and developed substantial rapport with their merchants. Square offers an alternative to traditional payment networks by providing an on-the-go hardware device that can be attached to a point-of-sale machine or even a smartphone or tablet. It's essentially the perfect alternative for small businesses, which is the niche Square is looking to occupy. Square could be intriguing for a number of reasons, beyond just being a payment alternative to Visa or MasterCard. For example, it's only now beginning to expand into international markets. The company launched in the U.K. during the first quarter, representing just the fourth country outside the U.S. that it operates in. The opportunity in Europe, Asia, and even the Middle East and Africa is enormous over the long run, giving Square what I believe could be a multidecade opportunity to grow its gross payment volume (GPV) by around 10% annually. Square's brand name and visibility are also beginning to catch on with larger retailers. As noted during the company's Q1 report, retailers with more than $125,000 in annual GPV grew 44% year over year and accounted for 43% of total GPV in the quarter, up 4 percentage points from the prior-year period. If Square can find a way to latch on to more small and midsize businesses, it could become a serious threat to the established payment networks. Given Square's double-digit long-term growth potential, investors looking for the next Google would be wise to take a closer look. ","

Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), has seen his net worth climb dramatically in recent years as Amazon's stock has soared. As you can imagine, the vast majority of Bezos' wealth is the result of his roughly 17% stake in Amazon, but he also has several other notable assets. Because of Amazon's excellent stock performance, Bezos is close to overtaking Bill Gates as the world's richest person as I write this. Image source: Getty Images. Bezos owns 80.9 million shares of Amazon, a 16.9% stake, which makes up the majority of his wealth. Since Amazon's share price has soared in recent years, this stake now represents an enormous sum of money. At its current stock price of approximately $992, this translates to $80.25 billion worth of Amazon stock. AMZN data by YCharts. Not only has Amazon's stock been rising at a rapid pace over the past few years, but it also has been rather volatile recently, as you can see from this one-month chart. AMZN data by YCharts. My point is that Bezos' net worth has been, and remains, a very fluid situation. If you're reading this even a few days after publication, his actual net worth could differ by billions of dollars from its $84.3 billion level when I wrote this. To calculate the current value of Bezos' Amazon stake (in billions), multiply 80.9 by the company's current stock price. In addition, it includes Bezos' other business ventures. He began a human spaceflight start-up in 2000 called Blue Origin, which has accelerated its development efforts in recent years. In fact, Bezos revealed that he has been selling about $1 billion of his Amazon stock annually to fund the company, which aims to begin commercial space flights in 2018. It's unclear what value the company currently has, but if successful, it could become an additional driver of his net worth in the future. Bezos also purchased The Washington Post for $250 million in cash in 2013, and this was done separately from Amazon. Stock-wise, Bezos was an early investor in Google (now Alphabet), and his $250,000 investment in 1998 would be worth more than $6 billion today. Bezos hasn't revealed how many shares he still owns, but this could account for a major portion of his non-Amazon wealth. Finally, Bezos' company, Bezos Expeditions has (at least partially) funded many successful ventures, including Airbnb, Twitter, Uber, and more. Since most of Bezos' more than $80 billion in wealth is in the form of Amazon stock, his precise net worth depends on the company's share price at the time you're reading this. As of this writing, Bezos is less than $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates as the richest person in the world, and if Amazon continues its hot streak, that's exactly what could happen in the near future.

Online retailers enjoy a structural advantage compared to traditional retailers: They don't have the burden of a large store base to maintain. Having too many stores in an environment where sales are shifting online has been the main driver behind the surge in retail bankruptcies over the past few years. Many surviving retailers are closing stores in an effort to adjust. But online retail comes with its own set of costs. Shipping is the obvious one. It's more expensive to ship small numbers of items to customers than it is to ship truckloads of items to stores. Overwhelmingly dominant e-commerce specialist Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) spent a whopping $7.2 billion on shipping in 2016, net of shipping-related revenue like Amazon Prime membership fees. There's another cost that drives down Amazon's margins: advertising. Amazon spent $7.2 billion on marketing in 2016, with that spending aimed at driving customers to its websites. Amazon's marketing spending rose 38% in 2016, while total revenue grew 27% and product sales grew 19%. An Amazon fulfillment center. Image source: Amazon. How does that compare to other retailers? Amazon spent more on marketing last year than Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), Target, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Home Depot, and Kroger  combined. Those retailers collectively produced $800 billion of sales, six times Amazon's total sales. Even for Amazon, with tens of millions of Prime members and a staggering e-commerce lead, getting customers to click ""buy"" isn't cheap. One thing to note: These five retailers report advertising spending, while Amazon reports marketing spending. Marketing is a broader term that encompasses more than just direct spending on ads, so this comparison isn't quite apples-to-apples. However, Amazon states in its 10-K that its marketing costs are largely variable, and that the increase last year was due primarily to increased spending on online and television ads. This suggests that advertising costs account for the bulk of Amazon's marketing spending. Here's a chart showing how much revenue each of these retailers produced last year: Data from annual reports. Chart by author. And here's how much each spent on advertising (or marketing, in Amazon's case): Amazon figure is marketing spending. Data from annual reports. Chart by author. As a percentage of revenue, Amazon spends dramatically more on marketing than any of these other retailers spend on advertising: Data from annual reports. Chart by author. Some brick-and-mortar retailers, particularly department stores, spend an Amazon-like percentage of revenue on advertising. Macy's, for example, spent 4.5% of revenue on advertising last year. But discount retailers like Wal-Mart are able to keep prices low in part because they spend so little on advertising relative to sales. Notably, warehouse club Costco spends nothing on advertising, other than sending coupon books to members and pre-opening mailers to prospective members. Of course, Amazon is growing much faster than these other retailers, and the heavy marketing spending is helping to drive that growth. But high advertising costs seem to be a common denominator when it comes to online retail. Wayfair, an online furniture seller, spent a whopping 12.1% of revenue of advertising in 2016, and its long-term goal is to bring that number down to a range of 6% to 8%. One reason to believe that Amazon will need to continue spending heavily on marketing is the newfound focus of traditional retailers on e-commerce. Wal-Mart has become extremely aggressive, launching a free two-day shipping initiative earlier this year and finding ways to remove costs and lower prices for customers. Wal-Mart's online sales grew by 63% year over year during the first quarter, twice its growth rate during the previous quarter. Best Buy has also turned up the heat over the past few years. The company implemented a price-matching policy both in-store and online, and it started shipping some online orders from its more than 1,000 stores. This not only improved the availability of items online, but it reduced shipping times as well. Best Buy turned its store base, viewed as a liability in the age of e-commerce, into an asset. These initiatives helped drive online sales growth in excess of 20% in the first quarter. But for the same reason that Amazon needs to spend so heavily on marketing to drive sales, traditional retailers going after online sales will likely need to do the same in order to drive customers to their own websites. I wouldn't be surprised to see advertising costs as a percentage of revenue creep up in the coming years for retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy as they grow their online businesses. That could, in turn, drive up advertising rates for Amazon and lead to even higher spending. Amazon spends a lot of money driving customers to its website. It would likely need to spend even more if its Prime subscription service weren't so popular. The most successful brick-and-mortar retailers are far more efficient, creating greater revenue for each dollar of advertising. Whether they can maintain that efficiency as sales continue to shift online remains to be seen. ","
      
    Amazon Spends More on Advertising Than Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Kroger Combined -- The Motley Fool

"Evan Niu, CFA",06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Reports emerged last year that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was seriously considering acquiring Slack, the hot start-up that took the enterprise messaging world by storm. At the time, the rumored offer could have been in the ballpark of $8 billion, rivaling some of the company's biggest acquisitions (like Skype for $8.5 billion). Instead, the software giant opted to develop its own competing messaging program in-house, which is a better decision in terms of capital efficiency ($8 billion is a massive amount of money). The result is Microsoft Teams, which recently became widely available. Slack Melbourne Office. Image source: Slack. It may seem odd that an e-commerce company would be interested in enterprise messaging, but you have to remember that Amazon has been making inroads in the broader enterprise market for years with its hugely popular Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, providing cloud infrastructure and hosting services to companies large and small. Amazon has used AWS to get in the door, but continues to introduce ancillary and related services for things like data analytics (QuickSight) and videoconferencing (Amazon Chime), among others. Slack also recently introduced Enterprise Grid, a more powerful version of its service that is intended to cater to larger organizations. Enterprise Grid likely creates some overlap in the customers that Amazon and Slack are chasing; many of these prospective Slack Enterprise Grid customers could very well already be AWS customers. Image source: Slack. That's potentially where Slack could fit: within Amazon's growing portfolio of enterprise services. The cloud competition between Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS has already been heating up, and will only escalate from here. The main reason I thought it was good that Microsoft never moved forward with its offer for Slack was the reported $8 billion price tag. Microsoft in particular has a poor track record with large acquisitions, which in many cases have resulted in enormous writedowns and impairments. Amazon's track record may be better, but the reported $9 billion that's floating around is even more than the previous rumored price tag, and Amazon has even less experience in the enterprise, which underscores the difficulty it could potentially face in integrating Slack and justifying that premium. Simply put, as much risk as Microsoft would have taken on at $8 billion, Amazon would be taking on even more risk -- both financially and operationally. At the end of last quarter, Amazon's balance sheet had $21.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and $3.8 billion in goodwill. An acquisition of this size would add quite a bit to goodwill, although it's not clear how much. To answer that question, we would need to know the Slack's net book value, which isn't available because Slack is a private start-up. What we do know, however, is that Slack's most recent funding round in 2016 valued the company at $3.8 billion (which still doesn't provide any indication of book value), so it's safe to say that a theoretical $9 billion deal would entail a hefty premium that would subsequently be allocated to goodwill. This is easily the biggest concern that Amazon investors should have. Strategically, there doesn't seem to be any market that Amazon is unwilling to enter -- everything from live-streaming esports to fashion to cloud infrastructure -- so it shouldn't be that surprising that the company could add enterprise messaging to the list. Just hopefully not at a $9 billion price tag. ","

"Jason Hall, Steve Symington, and Brian Feroldi",06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investments like that come along very rarely. And while it's crazy to expect any stock to generate that kind of life-changing return, it's still worth taking the time to identify characteristics that helped Amazon be so successful and look for stocks that could replicate at least some of that going forward. Our contributors see some parallels in lululemon athletica (NASDAQ:LULU), Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX), and BofI Holding Inc. (NYSE:AX). Image source: Getty Images. We aren't saying these stocks will turn a $1,000 investment into $500,000 -- but if they generate even a fraction of that, it could still be an incredible investing success. Keep reading to learn what sets these companies apart and why our contributors think they could deliver life-changing returns for investors going forward. Steve Symington (lululemon athletica): It might seem strange to predict lululemon athletica, a yoga apparel specialist, might enjoy growth potential anywhere in the ballpark of Amazon.com. But if giant competitors like Nike (NYSE:NKE) -- with its $82 billion market capitalization as of this writing -- have proven anything, it's that activewear is an enormous opportunity for brands with the ability to scale and take market share globally. And with a valuation of roughly $7 billion as of this writing, lululemon is doing exactly that. The company recently kicked off its first-ever global brand campaign, titled ""This is Yoga."" Through the campaign, lululemon is taking advantage of the power of social media to -- as CEO Laurent Potdevin puts it -- ""recontextualize how the world sees yoga culture"" and amplify visibility of its brand. Image source: Getty Images. More specifically, lululemon has taken aggressive action to optimize its website, improve visual merchandising, and bolster its social media engagement and digital marketing. It didn't take long for those efforts to bear fruit; last quarter, lululemon promptly saw digital comps improve from flat to low-double-digit percent growth. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that investors recently celebrated lululemon's forward-looking decision to close the majority of its physical kid-centric ivivva brand stores, opting instead to operate ivivva as primarily an online brand. But lululemon is also methodical in finding balance between its online presence and physical locations; the company recently revealed it will accelerate its physical footprint expansion with plans to open 50 new lululemon stores internationally this year (from a global base of 411 locations last quarter), with a particular focus on high-performing areas in Asia and Europe. In addition, lululemon expects its men's segment to eventually be as large or larger than the women's segment -- an encouraging goal considering men's accounted for just 20% of total sales last quarter. But it makes sense combined with the fact that men represented nearly 30% of all new guests for lululemon in the first quarter and delivered high-single-digit percentage growth in comparable-store sales for the company. If lululemon can sustain this momentum going forward, I see no reason it can't eventually rival the size of today's global athletic apparel leaders. Brian Feroldi (Tucows): One reason Amazon has kept its revenue growth rate so high for years is that it has rapidly reinvested its retail profits to develop its other business opportunities. One company that is following a similar strategy -- albeit on a much smaller scale -- is Tucows. Tucows is three businesses in one. Its cash cow is its domain name registry. The company earns a fee each time a consumer or business registers a domain name on its platform. Tucows currently services more than 29 million domains worldwide thanks to its recent eNom acquisition, which provides a recurring stream of cash flows. Image source: Getty Images. Tucows then uses those profits to fund growth in its two other businesses -- high-speed internet and mobile phone services, which are branded in the U.S. under the name ""Ting."" On the wireless side, Tucows is going after cost-sensitive customers. It claims that its average consumer's monthly bill is $23. This price is so low that the company had successfully attracted about 175,000 customers as of last quarter and is growing at a double-digit rate. Meanwhile, Tucows' internet fiber business is all about speed. It sells access to its 1,000 MB-per-second service at a competitive rate. While this business is still tiny overall, it is also growing quickly. Having 175,000 wireless subscribers might sound like a lot, but in reality, this number is puny when compared to the more than 400 million mobile phone subscribers in the U.S. alone. Meanwhile, its fiber service is currently available in just three U.S. cities. These figures speak volumes about Tucows' addressable market opportunity, which makes this a great stock to get to know if you are after long-term growth. Jason Hall (BofI Holding, Inc.): It has taken a long time for Amazon to move from an online shopping upstart -- and one that was in the niche business of selling books -- to the biggest online retailer in America. And just as Amazon was a tiny niche retailer 20 years ago, BofI Holding is a small online banker, swimming in a sea of much bigger traditional retail banks. Image source: Getty Images. But that trend has already begun to shift, with millions of Americans taking advantage of technology to reduce their need to ever go in their local bank branch. Not only has this helped people feel more comfortable with online banking, but it's also opened a lot of eyes to the financial benefits of working with an online bank like BofI, which generally pays higher yields and charges lower rates than bricks-and-mortar competitors. This has helped BofI deliver big growth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share has increased 225%, while its stock price has shot up 360%. But with a market cap of less than $1.5 billion at recent prices, BofI is still very small, with huge growth potential as more Americans make the move away from bricks-and-mortar banks that charge bigger fees and pay smaller yields to maintain those local branches that fewer and fewer customers even use. Trading for 12 times trailing earnings and about two times book value, this growth-oriented bank is on sale. Now's an excellent time to buy what could become the Amazon of banks. ","

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Digital currency bitcoin has risen by more than 200% in 2017, and it actually broke through the $3,000 level for the first time just hours before I wrote this -- and dropped by more than $500 soon after. It's fair to say that not only is bitcoin hitting record highs, but the market is extremely volatile. Many people have made speculative investments in the currency, with no upper limit to the price of a ""coin"" in sight. While I never recommend buying or not buying an investment simply because of what a billionaire says, it can be a smart idea to listen to what some of the most successful people in the world have to say. This is why Warren Buffett's investing wisdom is so widely followed, just to name one example. With that in mind, here are what three of the most respected billionaires in the world have said about bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. ""I think it's in a bubble. I just don't know when or how much it corrects,"" tweeted Cuban. He went on to mention that when everyone is bragging about making easy money, it's a sign of a bubble. When I think back to the tech bubble of the late '90s, or especially to the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, this certainly makes sense. ""Everyone always thinks that this time is different,"" Cuban added. While Cuban was tweeting his comments over a span of about an hour and a half, the price of bitcoin noticeably fell. The billionaire felt that this was further proof of his point, and tweeted a few hours later: ""You know it's a bubble when a random twitter thread bounces the price."" On the other hand, Cuban also praised blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin. ""I think blockchain is very valuable and will be at the core of most transactions in the future,"" tweeted Cuban. ""Healthcare, finance, etc all will use it."" In a nutshell, Cuban is saying that bitcoin and its blockchain technology does have value. It's just not worth $3,000 at this point in time. Warren Buffett is perhaps the most respected investor in the entire world, and hasn't said much about bitcoin recently. However, the Oracle of Omaha notably dismissed bitcoin as an investment in a 2014 CNBC interview. Buffett essentially said that bitcoin is essentially a more modern version of writing someone a check or sending a money order, and advised investors to avoid it. ""Stay away from it. It's a mirage, basically...The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is a joke in my view."" Not surprisingly, the response by many tech industry heavyweights, such as Marc Andreessen, was to dismiss Buffett's comments, claiming bitcoin is yet another new technology Buffett doesn't understand. And Andreessen may have a point -- Buffett has notoriously avoided investing in new technologies throughout his career, and has actually said it's because he doesn't understand them well enough to invest. To be fair, remember that Buffett's comments were made over three years ago, and the value of the blockchain technology in particular has been made much clearer since then. So, it's entirely possible that Buffett's viewpoint on bitcoin has changed somewhat. Even so, don't count on Buffett buying bitcoin with Berkshire Hathaway's capital anytime soon. Finally, billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson is perhaps the biggest fan of bitcoin and blockchain technology of the three men discussed here. In fact, Branson has gone so far as to refer to blockchain as an ""economic revolution."" At last year's Virgin Disruptors event in London, Branson specifically mentioned a potential application of using the blockchain to create a better land titling system. He mentioned that in developing countries, land titles are frequently forged or taken from the rightful property owners, and said that a blockchain-based solution could solve this problem once and for all. Branson has held an annual ""Blockchain Summit"" on his private island for the past two years, which has resulted in several new ideas and partnerships. In regards to bitcoin as a currency and whether or not it will work, Branson replied ""Well, I think it is working."" However, Branson also acknowledged the currency's volatility, and that other similar currencies could emerge that ""may be even better."" ","

I recently explained why I still won't touch Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) -- even at a near-40% discount to its IPO price of $26. Its monthly active user (MAU) growth remains sluggish, its ad revenues are declining, its new initiatives are floundering, and its bottom line remains deep in the red. Source: Getty. Twitter's Data Licensing business sells a ""firehose"" of over 500 million daily tweets to various companies. These customers include analytics firms, which analyze the data to identify consumer trends; news agencies, which filter the data for breaking news stories; and even high-frequency trading firms, which use trending tickers and stories to place trades. Simply put, Twitter sells its river of information to companies that try to turn its tweets into actionable data. Back in 2010, Twitter's Data Licensing business brought in 75% of the company's revenue, with the rest coming from ads. But in 2016, just 11% of its revenue came from the Data Licensing business. The slowdown in Twitter's core advertising business makes the Data Licensing & Other unit's growth look impressive. But as seen in the following chart, its sales growth has also been waning over the past five quarters. Data Licensing & Other: Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 Q1 2017 YOY revenue growth 34% 35% 26% 14% 17% % of Twitter's revenue 11% 11% 12% 11% 14% Source: Twitter quarterly reports. To expand that business, Twitter forged several major analytics partnerships over the years. Its most promising deal was with IBM (NYSE:IBM), which integrated Twitter feeds into its cloud-based analytics platform for enterprise customers in 2014. Big Blue also trained 10,000 IT consultants to be experts in tweet-based analytics. Twitter has an ongoing bot problem. Source: Getty. Twitter's desire to grow its Data Licensing revenue could also encourage it to overlook its bot, spam, and fake accounts -- which all keep its stream of tweets flowing with automated retweets. Of course, Twitter could merely be complacent or turning a blind eye to these issues to report better MAU growth. A recent study by the University of Southern California and Indiana University found that 9% to 15% of all Twitter's MAUs were likely automated accounts -- which could strengthen its firehose, but discourage cautious companies from buying ads. It could be a tough call for  Twitter to sell its Data Licensing business, since it's a high-margin business that generates better growth than its core advertising business. But doing so might streamline its core business and enable it to post better top and bottom line growth. ","

Keith Speights,06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Israel ""Izzy"" Englander has made plenty of smart stock picks during his career. The co-founder of the Millennium Management hedge fund is worth more than $5 billion as a result. Englander just added to his fund's positions in three drug stocks -- Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Synergy Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SGYP), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC). Here's why the billionaire likely bought more shares of these three stocks that haven't performed very well so far in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Millennium Management bought another 480,000 shares of Gilead Sciences stock during the first quarter of 2017. This puts the hedge fund's total stake in Gilead at nearly $129 million. In addition, Millennium bought 200,000 call options for the biotech. What makes Englander more bullish about Gilead Sciences? My guess is he likes three things about the biotech. One is its promising pipeline. Gilead recently submitted its bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide combo to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval. This combo could be the biotech's next megablockbuster in treating HIV. Second, I suspect Englander thinks that Gilead's valuation won't go much, if any, lower than it already is. The stock has fallen more than 20% in the last 12 months, with shares now trading at less than nine times expected earnings. Third, like most investors, Englander probably expects Gilead to make one or more transformative acquisitions that could rejuvenate interest in the stock. Gilead COO Kevin Young recently stated that the big biotech is ""looking far and wide"" at potential assets in a number of therapeutic areas. At the end of 2016, Millennium Management held close to 1.9 million shares of Synergy Pharmaceuticals. You can add another 1.39 million shares to that count during the first quarter. Englander obviously thinks highly of Synergy. One reason for this positive opinion could be that the billionaire likes the prospects for Synergy's gastrointestinal-disease drug Trulance. Weekly prescription volume for Trulance in treating chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is steadily growing after Synergy launched the drug in March 2017. The company recently stated that over 60% of patients with commercial insurance now have unrestricted access to Trulance. Looking ahead, Synergy could see even more impressive results with Trulance in an additional indication. The FDA is scheduled to make a decision on approval of the drug in treating irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) by Jan. 24, 2018. While another billionaire, Pershing Square Capital's Bill Ackman, threw in the towel on Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Englander has apparently become even more positive about the stock. During the first quarter, Millennium Management bought more than 320,000 additional shares of Valeant. What does Englander see in Valeant that Ackman doesn't? The best answer might be that Englander believes that the drugmaker's CEO, Joe Papa, can deliver on his promises. So far, Papa appears to be doing just that. He promised in August 2016 that he would reduce Valeant's debt by $5 billion within 18 months. Since then, the company has sold off multiple non-core assets, most recently announcing the sale of iNova Pharmaceuticals for $930 million in cash. Surprisingly, Valeant stock has turned in a better performance than either Gilead Sciences or Synergy so far in 2017. That's not all that great, since Valeant's share price is still below where it started the year. However, the company's asset sales have helped prop up the stock to some extent. Whether or not Englander's bet pays off, though, will probably depend more on how Valeant's new products like psoriasis drug Siliq perform. ","
      
    Why This Billionaire Just Bought Gilead Sciences, Synergy, and Valeant Stock -- The Motley Fool

"Matthew Frankel, CFP",06222017,Fool,06152017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager, sees a bright future ahead for Fannie Mae (NASDAQOTH:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (NASDAQOTH:FMCC) stock. In fact, Ackman has purchased 115.6 million and 63.5 million shares, respectively, of the companies. While it's entirely possible that Ackman and his investors could make millions if he turns out to be right, it's important to understand his reasoning for buying the stocks -- and why it's probably not a smart idea for most investors to join him. Image source: Getty Images. Other than the U.S. Government, no investor owns more Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac common stock than Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund. In a nutshell, Ackman (and other hedge fund managers) bought shares in the two companies because he perceives a favorable risk-reward opportunity. In fact, in 2014, Ackman made the case that the stocks would be worth between $23 and $47 per share if they were allowed to recapitalize and return to shareholder control. Currently, Fannie and Freddie are worth $2.38 and $2.29 per share, respectively. So, even on the low end of Ackman's analysis-based estimates, this would be a tenfold increase in value. In addition, Ackman argues that if the companies returned to the shareholders, the government's stake could result in an additional $600 billion in revenue for the Treasury. It would be a win-win scenario and would be in the government's best interest, as well as that of the shareholders, so Ackman reasons that there is a good chance the government would agree. He also feels that reforming Fannie and Freddie is the only viable solution the government has when it comes to the two companies. Although it's taking longer than Ackman presumably had originally hoped it would for the Fannie and Freddie saga to play out, it appears that he is still as optimistic as ever about the investment. In a report earlier in 2017, Ackman said that ""we (Pershing) believe the shares of a reformed Fannie and Freddie will be worth a multiple of their current price."" The Trump administration has also given Ackman renewed hope that reform is coming. During his confirmation hearing, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said, ""What I've said and I believe, we need housing finance reform, so we shouldn't just leave Fannie and Freddie as is for the next four or eight years under government control, without a fix."" In his 2016 letter to Pershing Square investors, Ackman said, ""We believe the new administration has the willingness and ability to make the necessary changes to Fannie and Freddie's business model to preserve widespread access to the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage market."" If Ackman is right and the companies are allowed to recapitalize and return to the private sector, these stocks could increase tenfold under the right circumstances. However, in the more likely scenario that this doesn't happen, it's entirely possible that they could ultimately go to zero. It is also important to realize that while the investment could make sense from a risk-reward standpoint for a billionaire, that's not necessarily the case for smaller investors. As a simplified example, if an investment costs $2 and has an equal probability of going to either $10 or $0 in a year, the odds are definitely in your favor. Similar logic applies here. However, the problem is that still leaves you with a 50% probability of losing all of your money. This can certainly make sense for Ackman, who can afford to take chances like this with a relatively small portion of the assets he controls. The same cannot be said for long-term investors with modest account sizes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may seem tempting. And to be fair, Ackman has made some excellent points about the stocks, and it's easy to see where he's coming from. ","

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators hit Google with a record 2.4-billion-euro (2.10 billion pounds) fine for favouring its own shopping service, taking a tough line in the first of three probes of its dominance in searches and smartphone operating systems. “Google’s strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn’t just about attracting customers. It wasn’t just about making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine,” she told a news conference. The fine will be easy for the world’s biggest search engine to absorb, but Google must now move fast to satisfy Vestager’s concerns while limiting the longer-term hit to its highly lucrative search business. It also leaves other tech companies wondering how far Vestager may go to force U.S. tech giants to concede more ground to smaller competitors. Vestager has become one of the world’s most combative antitrust regulators with powers to impose multi-billion dollar fines and force companies to make radical changes to their businesses. Last year, the former Danish economy minister ordered Apple to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of 13 billion euros as it ruled the company had received illegal state aid. Apple is appealing the decision. The decision is the first of a series of competition rulings that Google faces from the European Commission, which has not shrunk from taking on U.S. tech giants such as Alphabet, which has annual revenues of $90 billion and a market value of $665 billion. The Commission has also charged Google with using its Android mobile operating system to crush rivals, a case that could potentially be the most damaging for the company, as it is the system used in most smartphones. The company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising. The Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results. Vestager said in a statement that Google had “denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.” Google said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search. “We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a statement. Alphabet, whose shares were down about 1 percent, said in a separate statement it would review the Commission’s formal decision but expected to accrue the fine in the second quarter. The biggest risk to Google is not the fine but the changes demanded to its business, said Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies. Google will have to brief the Commission on what measures it plans to take within 60 days of the decision and present periodic reports. Eight complainants were involved in the case which the EU declined to name in line with its policy. According to Windsor’s calculations, the 2.42-billion-euro fine represents just 22.6 days of the operating cash flow that  Alphabet reported in its latest quarter. “What has the potential to hurt Google and be far more damaging is what remedies the European Commission may or may not impose on Google as a result,” Windsor said. “That’s where the real damage could be done.” The fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet’s revenue, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices. News Corp said it applauded “the European Commission’s leadership in confronting the discriminatory behaviour of Google in the comparison shopping industry.” “We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,” it said in a statement, accusing Google of profiting from “commodifying content and enabling the proliferation of flawed and fake news.” The penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet’s 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion. “This decision is a game-changer. The Commission confirmed that consumers do not see what is most relevant for them on the world’s most used search engine but rather what is best for Google,” said Monique Goyens, director general of EU consumer group BEUC. Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, welcomed the Commission’s findings and urged it to act on Google’s Android mobile operating system following its 2013 complaint that Google restricted competition in software running on mobile devices.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"The European Commission said the world’s most popular internet search engine has 90 days to stop favoring its own shopping service or face a further penalty per day of up to 5 percent of Alphabet’s average daily global turnover. The fine, equivalent to 3 percent of Alphabet’s turnover, is the biggest regulatory setback for Google, which settled with U.S. enforcers in 2013 without a penalty after agreeing to change some of its search practices. The EU competition enforcer has also charged Google with using its Android mobile operating system to crush rivals, a case that could potentially be the most damaging for the company, with the system used in most smartphones. The company has also been accused of blocking rivals in online search advertising. The Commission found that Google, with a market share in searches of over 90 percent in most European countries, had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results. “What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Google said its data showed people preferred links taking them directly to products they want and not to websites where they have to repeat their search. “We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a statement. The penalty payment for failure to comply would amount to around $12 million a day based on Alphabet’s 2016 turnover of $90.3 billion.

,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian courts can force internet search leader Google to remove results worldwide, the country’s top court ruled on Wednesday, drawing criticism from civil liberties groups arguing such a move sets a precedent for censorship on the internet. In its 7-2 decision, Canada’s Supreme Court found that a court in the country can grant an injunction preventing conduct anywhere in the world when it is necessary to ensure the injunction’s effectiveness. “The internet has no borders - its natural habitat is global,” the Supreme Court wrote in its judgment. “The only way to ensure that the interlocutory injunction attained its objective was to have it apply where Google operates - globally.” Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The case stems from claims by Equustek Solutions Inc, a small technology company in British Columbia that manufactures network devices, that distributor Datalink Technologies Gateways relabeled one of its products and sold it as its own online and acquired trade secrets to design and manufacture a competing product. In 2012, Equustek asked Google to remove Datalink search results until the case against the company was resolved. While Google removed over 300 specific web pages associated with Datalink, it did so only on the Canadian version of its search engine. The Supreme Court of British Columbia subsequently ordered Google to stop displaying search results in any country for any part of Datalink’s websites. In its appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, Google had argued that the global reach of the order was unnecessary and that it raised concerns over freedom of expression. The Supreme Court rejected Google’s argument that the right to freedom of expression should have prevented the order from being issued. “This is not an order to remove speech that, on its face, engages freedom of expression values,” the court wrote in its ruling. “We have not, to date, accepted that freedom of expression requires the facilitation of the unlawful sale of goods.” The global reach was necessary, according to the court, because if the removed search results were restricted to Canada alone, purchasers both in and out of Canada could easily continue to find and buy from Datalink. OpenMedia, a Canadian group campaigning for open communications, opposed the ruling. “There is great risk that governments and commercial entities will see this ruling as justifying censorship requests that could result in perfectly legal and legitimate content disappearing off the web because of a court order in the opposite corner of the globe,” said OpenMedia spokesman David Christopher. Google cannot appeal the Supreme Court ruling. If the company has evidence that complying with the order would force it to violate other countries’ laws, including interfering with freedom of expression, it can apply to the British Columbia court to alter the order, the Supreme Court said, noting Google has not made such an application.

Nearly two years ago, Google co-founder Larry Page announced the tech giant would be remade as Alphabet, a holding company whose units would include Google and an array of unrelated pursuits in areas such as healthcare, self-driving cars and urban planning. Wall Street cheered. Previously those riskier ventures had been lumped into Google’s overall financial results. Investors would now see Google’s performance independent of its so-called “Other Bets,” an eclectic collection of 11 ventures. They include Nest, a maker of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats; Calico, which seeks to prolong the human lifespan; and X, the company’s secretive research lab. Alphabet’s top management also aimed to boost accountability by appointing chief executives to head each of the Other Bets. Few people in Google’s constellation of ventures had ever held the title prior to that. But so far Alphabet has failed to show it can convert its Other Bets from experiments to businesses with the reach, impact and money-making potential of Google’s core search and advertising operations. Interviews with two dozen former Alphabet executives and employees reveal an organization grappling with how much time and resources Other Bets deserve in the pursuit of profitability. In the first quarter, which ended March 31, the ventures lost a combined $855 million; that’s on top of a collective $3.6 billion loss for 2016. As a whole, Alphabet generated $90.3 billion in revenue in 2016. Google’s share of that revenue was $89.5 billion, while its 2016 operating income was $27.9 billion. Alphabet’s early days have seen more pruning than expansion of its holdings. The company has skinned back plans for Google Fiber, which delivers rapid Internet service in 10 metro areas. This month, Alphabet agreed to sell robotics company Boston Dynamics to Japanese multinational SoftBank Group Corp. It unloaded its Terra Bella satellite imaging business in February. At one point last year, it was even looking to sell Nest, the largest of the Other Bets, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Google paid an eye-popping $3.2 billion for the startup in 2014. Meanwhile, a series of executives have departed since the reorganization, including the heads of Nest, an Internet operation called Access and a venture capital firm known as GV. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined repeated requests for comment or to make executives available for interviews. Supporters of the restructuring frame the early struggles as typical growing pains. For now, Wall Street isn’t worried: Alphabet’s stock is near an all-time high, having reached $1,000 per share in June. Ruth Porat, the no-nonsense chief financial officer who has steered the restructuring, has won rave reviews from investors for enforcing financial accountability across Alphabet. Some Other Bets have made notable strides. Life sciences initiative Verily recently attracted $800 million in outside investment. Self-driving car project Waymo is considered among the leaders in the burgeoning industry. Still, it’s not yet clear the structure will enable Alphabet to do what most companies cannot: conceive the next wave of innovation in-house or through the development of key acquisitions. That goal is central to both the company’s mission and investor expectations, analysts say. “The reason Google gets to trade at a decent multiple… is because there’s a growth story beyond advertising,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. The Alphabet structure is Google’s stab at an age-old corporate conundrum: sustaining innovation within a giant enterprise. Alphabet’s strategy is to give entrepreneurs the autonomy of a startup, coupled with the discipline of a traditional corporate structure. Roughly once a quarter, Other Bets leaders meet with the Alphabet board – comprised of Porat, Page, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and David Drummond, Alphabet’s senior vice president of corporate development – to discuss funding and performance, according to two former employees. At the same time, Alphabet is establishing separate compensation plans for the Other Bets to reward employees if their ventures succeed, mirroring startup incentives. The formula has primed Alphabet’s emerging businesses for “global impact,” Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said this month at the annual stockholders meeting at the Mountain View headquarters. “There is one solution that we know works well in capitalism, which is boards, shareholders, CEOs,” Schmidt said. “My bet is that the traditional lessons of business organization will in fact result in success at Alphabet.” Still, Alphabet top brass continue to hold sway over key strategy and financing decisions, a dynamic that has chafed Other Bets chief executives who’ve complained they are treated more like chief operating officers than shot callers, according to people familiar with the situation. In addition, scrutiny from Wall Street limits how generous Alphabet can be in extending Google’s resources to Other Bets, said Brian McClendon, a former vice president of engineering at Google. “As of yet, the restructuring hasn’t provided what I think is one of the immediate benefits, which is risk-taking investment,” he said. Some companies acquired by Google found that being part of Alphabet wasn’t what they’d bargained for. Two former Nest employees said they were promised generous funding and time to achieve profitability following the company’s acquisition by Google in 2014. But after the restructuring, Alphabet executives were keenly focused on revenue, one former employee said. Pricey overhead has made the path to profitability tougher. After the restructuring, Alphabet began charging Other Bets for their portion of shared services such as security and facilities, ending what had previously amounted to a subsidy, people familiar with the situation said. The units also felt pressure to maintain Google perks such as free employee meals. “One of the pitfalls (of Alphabet) is that those companies are asked to stand on their own two feet, but they may inherit the cost structure of Google,” said Nest investor Peter Nieh, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. In early 2016, Alphabet explored selling Nest in an effort code-named Project Amalfi, according to three people familiar with the matter. No deal materialized, and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell departed last year. Fadell declined to comment. Boston Dynamics, acquired in 2013 during a robotics shopping spree led by Android creator Andy Rubin, enjoyed generous funding at first. But it was adrift after Rubin’s departure, two former employees said. Rubin did not respond to requests for comment. The creation of the Other Bets has also changed what it means to work for Google. Some grumble that their role now is to subsidize innovation at their sister companies, rather than to innovate themselves. “It did sort of send the message to people who stayed back at Google, whether in search or in ads: Your job isn’t to push the envelope,” one former Googler said. Employee transfers to X, the illustrious “moonshot factory,” are more complicated now that it’s a separate entity, former employees say. That’s a striking shift, especially for high-performing employees accustomed to moving about the company almost at will, said Punit Soni, a former Google employee who is now chief executive of Learning Motors, an artificial intelligence startup. “A basic premise of Google was people could do whatever they wanted,” Soni said. “I can see why people will feel like it’s no longer the old Google.” In the meantime, co-founder Page is pursuing yet another “moonshot”: flying cars. He is the primary investor in Kitty Hawk, a startup in the field that is entirely outside the Alphabet umbrella. ",Google faces a daunting challenge organizing itself under Alphabet | VentureBeat

The decision was outlined in a blog post by Google cloud computing chief Diane Greene, who joined the company in 2015 and has been responsible for the rapid growth of Google’s cloud business. Google’s practice of analyzing incoming and outgoing emails of its free consumer Gmail users has been criticized on privacy concerns. Google's G Suite business bundle have been gaining more enterprise users in the past year, with more than 3 million companies paying for the G Suite service, the company said.

 ,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"After a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals, the European Commission hit Google with a record 2.4 billion euro ($2.73 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service and an order to treat rival services the same way it treats its own products. “When I saw this yesterday, it absolutely rang a bell,” said Georg Berrisch, a partner at Baker Botts who advised Microsoft in its EU regulatory dispute while at another law firm. The European Commission slapped a 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 and ordered it to take steps to boost software competition. It failed to comply with that decision and was subsequently fined 899 million euros. In total, its battle with the EU in several other investigations cost it more than 2.2 billion euros in penalties. In an oblique reference to Microsoft, which faced nearly two decades of legal scrutiny for antitrust violations, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told a 2011 U.S. Senate hearing: “We get it. By that I mean, we get the lessons of our corporate predecessors.” But Google has much to learn, said Stephen Kinsella at law firm Sidley Austin, who advises Google complainant and UK online shopping comparison website Kelkoo. “Years ago Google said they wouldn’t make the mistakes that Microsoft did. Instead they made all of them and came up with a few of their own. The public statements yesterday show they still don’t get it,” he said. Google said on Tuesday it disagreed with the EU’s findings that it had abused its dominant position and was considering an appeal. It said it looked forward to continuing to make its case. “The real danger for Google is to enter into a prolonged battle with the Commission on whether what it has done is sufficient to comply with its decision. It could be quite expensive for Google in the end. This is not the end of the story,” Berrisch said. Underlining Google’s task, the Commission on Wednesday published a tender for technical expertise to assist it with the case. The five-year contract is worth 10 million euros and can be renewed. “The real concern is whether the Commission will manage to force Google to change its business model, its algorithms in a way that could be detrimental to the business,” said Wesley Lebeau, fund manager at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi company. “Search engine is still about 60 percent of Alphabet’s valuation so that is a big deal, even though the drivers for future growth are YouTube and all the Alphabet companies — Waymo, NEST, Verily,” he said. Tech titans have benefited so far from the perception that they bring benefits to society, said Freddie Lait, founder at Latitude Investment Management. “But there is a small chance that, if the shine wears off and you have more of these terrorist videos...and the fine is a huge fine, which sent a message to consumers that there’s been wrongdoing,” he said. “If the shine comes off, the claws are out from regulators and governments to try and get their pound of flesh out of all of the big tech companies.” ","

 ,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"The push comes amid growing legal uncertainty, in the United States and across the globe, about how technology firms must comply with government requests for foreign-held data. That has raised alarm that criminal and terrorism investigations are being hindered by outdated laws that make the current process for sharing information slow and burdensome. Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel, announced the company’s international framework during a speech in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that wields influence in the Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. Both companies had previously objected in court to U.S. law enforcement efforts to use domestic search warrants for data held overseas because the practice could erode user privacy. But the technology industry and privacy advocates have also admitted the current rules for appropriate cross-border data requests are untenable. The Mountain View, California-based company called for allowing countries that commit to baseline privacy, human rights and due process principles to directly request data from U.S. providers without the need to consult the U.S. government as an intermediary. The measure is intended to be reciprocal. Countries that do not adhere to the standards, such as an oppressive regime, would not be eligible, but the framework could incentivize better respect for digital privacy among those nations, Walker said. Google did not detail specific baseline principles in its framework. “This couldn’t be a more urgent set of issues,” Walker said in an interview before his speech, noting that recent acts of terrorism in Europe underscored the need to move quickly. Current agreements that allow law enforcement access to data stored overseas, known as mutual legal assistance treaties, involve a formal diplomatic request for data and require the host country to obtain a warrant on behalf of the requesting country. That can often take several months. In January, a divided federal appeals court refused to reconsider its decision from last year that said the U.S. government could not force Microsoft or other companies to hand over customer data stored abroad under a domestic warrant. The U.S. Justice Department has until midnight on Friday to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court. It did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. judges have ruled against Google in similar recent cases, however, elevating the potential for Supreme Court review. Companies, privacy advocates and judges themselves have urged Congress to address the problem rather than leave it to courts. U.S. lawmakers have worked on bipartisan legislation, known as the International Communications Privacy Act, in recent years that would modernize cross-border data requests, but it has failed to become law. Walker said on Thursday Google largely supported the legislation, calling it necessary to move forward with international agreements. Google also asked Congress to codify warrant requirements for data requests that involve content, such as the actual message found within an email. Chris Calabrese, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said Google’s framework was “broadly correct” but urged caution about the process for letting countries make direct requests to providers. “We need to make sure the people in the club are the right people,” he said.

 ,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"(This June 26 story corrects paragraph 6 to reflect that Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident, not a skydiving accident)) By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - Dozens of companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, CBS Corp and Viacom Inc urged a federal appeals court on Monday to rule that a law banning sex discrimination in the workplace offers protections to gay employees. The brief submitted by 50 companies to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan marks the first time such a large group of businesses has backed arguments about employment discrimination that LGBT groups and the administration of former President Barack Obama have made for years. The companies said bias against gay employees is widespread, with more than 40 percent of gay workers reporting harassment and other forms of discrimination in various studies. The lack of a federal law clearly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has hindered recruitment in states that have not adopted their own, the companies said. “Recognizing that our uniform federal law protects LGBT employees would benefit individual businesses, and the economy as a whole, by removing an artificial barrier to the recruitment, retention, and free flow of talent,” wrote the companies’ lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The companies asked the 2nd Circuit to revive a lawsuit by the estate of Donald Zarda, who claimed he was fired from his job as a skydiving instructor on Long Island after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. Zarda died in a base-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a panel of three 2nd Circuit judges dismissed Zarda’s case, saying the court’s decision in a separate case in 2000 that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 foreclosed his claims. But last month, the full court, which can overturn the prior ruling, agreed to review the case. That came weeks after a different appeals court in Chicago became the first to rule that Title VII protects gay workers. Zarda’s former employer, Altitude Express Inc, says Congress did not intend for Title VII to apply to gay workers when it passed the law more than 50 years ago, and courts do not have the power to change the meaning of the law. A different appeals court in Atlanta, Georgia, is currently considering whether to revisit a March decision that dismissed a lawsuit by a former hospital security guard who said she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.

 ,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"BRUSELAS (Reuters) - Las autoridades de competencia de la UE impusieron a Google el martes una multa histórica de 2.420 millones de euros, una decisión que sugiere que posiblemente serán duros en otros dos casos con la filial de Alphabet. La Comisión Europea dijo que el motor de búsqueda en internet más popular del mundo tiene 90 días para poner fin a sus prácticas anticompetitivas o en su defecto afrontar penalizaciones de hasta un 5 por ciento del volumen medio diario de los ingresos de Alphabet a escala mundial. La Comisión concluyó que Google ha concedido de forma sistemática un lugar prominente en las búsquedas a su propio servicio de comparativas de productos (Google Shopping) en detrimento de sus rivales. “Lo que Google ha hecho es ilegal según las normas de competencia de la UE y ha negado a otras empresas la oportunidad de competir por los méritos e innovar. Y lo que es más importante, ha negado a los consumidores europeos una oferta genuina de servicios y los beneficios completos de la innovación”, dijo la comisaria de Competencia, Margrethe Vestager, en un comunicado. Esta medida se produce tras una investigación de siete años a instancias de decenas de quejas de rivales como el sitio web estadounidense de opiniones de consumidores Yelp, TripAdvisor, la web de comparativas británicas Foundem, News Corp y el grupo de presión FairSearch.    Se trata de la multa más elevada para una sola compañía por infringir las normas de competencia desde la sanción de 1.060 millones de euros que la Comisión impuso al fabricante estadounidense de semiconductores Intel en 2009. También supone el mayor revés regulatorio para Google hasta la fecha, después de llegar a un acuerdo en 2013 con las autoridades estadounidenses para dejar de “recortar” opiniones y otros datos de páginas de internet rivales para sus propios productos. El regulador de competencia comunitario también acusa a Google de usar su sistema operativo para móviles Android para machacar a sus rivales, un caso que podría ser el más perjudicial para la empresa estadounidense. También ha sido acusada de bloquear a los rivales en la búsqueda de publicidad online y la Comisión ha advertido sobre la posibilidad de multas disuasorias si Google es encontrado culpable. ","

 ,06292017,Reuters,06222017,"The U.S. chipmaker subsequently challenged the decision at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second highest. Judges rejected its arguments in 2014, saying the Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel’s 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The company then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). “I expect a judgment sometime next year,” Marc van der Woude, vice-president at the General Court, told a competition conference organized by Concurrence. Intel got a boost last year when ECJ court adviser Nils Wahl questioned whether the company’s actions had really harmed competition. The court follows such recommendations in four out of five cases.

Tomi Kilgore,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 28, 2017 7:27 a.m. ET EU’s $2.7 billion fine represents less than 3% of Alphabet’s cash position By The $2.7 billion fine slapped on Google parent Alphabet Inc. by European Union regulators might look small next to the internet giant’s cash position, but the impact to investors is a lot bigger...6.1-times bigger to be exact. Alphabet’s stock

                                   sank $24.00, or 2.5%, to close at a six-week low of $948.09. The selloff follows the announcement of the fine, which EU antitrust regulators said was a result of Google abusing its dominance in search to promote its own comparison shopping service while demoting those of competitors. Alphabet said it disagreed with the decision and would consider an appeal. Don’t miss: Google’s big European fine is likely bad news for Facebook, Amazon and others. Analyst Shyam Patil at Susquehanna Financial said while the fine was “large” for the EU, the negative impact on Alphabet’s finances would be “relatively small.” The company had $92.44 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, according to recent filings, up from $86.33 billion as of Dec. 31. That means the fine represents less than 3% of Alphabet’s cash position. Considering the company generated an average of about $67.8 million a day in cash during the first quarter, it could raise the cash to pay for the fine in just 40 days, or by Aug. 8. See also: How Google’s $2.7 billion fine stacks up against each EU country’s annual budget contribution “Moreover, even the potential noncompliance fines,” estimated at up to $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, “are relatively minor (less than 6% of gross cash),” Patil wrote in a note to clients. Investors may not be so flippant, however. The stock’s drop Tuesday has wiped out about $16.60 billion in market capitalization. With Patil saying he believed the “downside risk” to the stock price is $850, that could represent a loss of 10.3% from current levels, or another $67.85 billion in market cap. Granted, there could be a larger cost to Google’s business in Europe than just the fine. Patil estimates that total Europe revenue from product listing ads (PLAs) represented about 3% to 7% of total revenue. Based on the FactSet consensus for second-quarter revenue of $25.60 billion, that would translate into a potential negative impact of between $768.0 million to $1.79 billion, although Patil said “the actual impact is likely to be less.’ If Google is forced to include competitor listings in its PLA results, Patil said a “reasonable” estimate for click share losses would be about 25%. That could reduce total revenue by just 1% to 2%, or by only $256.0 million to $512.0 million. That said, Patil reiterated his bullish positive rating on the stock, and his price target of $1,200, which is 26.6% above current levels. For investors, that could mean a gain of $174.26 billion in market cap. The shares have still run up 19.6% year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite Index

                                   shares, Oelschlager described both stocks as still “compelling.” He cited Alphabet’s 17% increase in first-quarter revenue and said, “the stock is right around a 5% free cash yield, which is roughly where the market is and might even be better.” A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after capital-spending commitments. This is money that can be used for any corporate purpose, including acquisitions or other expansion. If you divide a company’s annual free cash flow per share by its share price, you have the free cash flow yield, which can be used for comparison The two Alphabet share classes together made up 8.1% of the Red Oak Technology Select Fund as of March 31, by far the fund’s largest equity position. The fund was ranked 17th of 7,581 actively managed open-ended mutual fund, based on average total returns for five years, through June 26, according to data provided by Morningstar. It has $460 million in assets and was established in December 1998. Oelschlager, who is Oak Associates Funds’ co-chief investment officer, took over as the fund’s portfolio manager in April 2006. Before joining Oak Associates in 2000, he was an equity analyst for the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Here’s how the fund’s performance has stacked up against its peer group, according to Morningstar, as well as the S&P 500 technology sector and the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF

                                   through June 27: Oelschlager attributed a great part of the fund’s success to its focus on the technology sector. But it stands out even among its peers. Among 51 actively managed U.S.open-ended technology funds — which excludes narrowly focused funds, such as those that only buy semiconductor stocks, for example — the Red Oak Technology Select Fund ranked third over the past five years. Also see: No. 1 mutual fund, which made a killing off Amazon and Tesla, is now focused on these stocks Oelschlager said free cash flow yield and price-to-earnings valuations are important parts of his team’s stock selection, but that he also is concerned with the “sustainability” of a business.“ Many tech investors “think they need to find the big stars of the future,” he told MarketWatch in a June 28 interview, but the odds of identifying the next Google or Facebook “are against you.” “When you focus on companies growing the fastest, the deck again is stacked against you because of high valuations,” he added. Another stock Oelschlager is keen on is KLA-Tencor Corp.

                                   which makes equipment for the semiconductor industry. Valuation is the reason: free cash flow is about 6% and the shares trade for 15.9 times the consensus 2018 earnings estimate among analysts polled by FactSet. That compares with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.1 for the S&P 500 information technology sector and of 16.5 for the entire S&P 500 index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -1.97% KLA-Tencor’s valuation looked especially low because it “dominates” its industry niche, he said. “Granted, it is a cyclical, and does not necessarily deserve a high multiple, but they have proven to be fairly consistent and the stock looks like a good long-term investment,” he added. One position Oelschlager has “cut back quite a bit” is chip maker Nvidia Inc.

                                   after it returned 227% during 2016. According to Morningstar, the fund’s annual turnover ratio has been 6%, which is amazingly low for an actively managed fund. This underscores Oelschlager’s style of sticking with companies showing consistently high rates of growth. “A lot of people are tempted to trade a lot, because it feels like you are accomplishing something by constantly making moves. But often times, the best thing is to do nothing,” he said. However, the fund will be much more active during periods of disruption in the market, he said. During 2009, for example, the fund’s turnover was 30%. That was in the wake of the credit crisis that sent the S&P 500 information technology sector down 43% in 2008. Here are the Red Oak Technology Select Fund’s 10 largest stock holdings (out of 42), as of March 31. They accounted for 37% of the portfolio. There are actually 11 stocks listed here, because the fund holds both classes of Alphabet.

The technology sector, which was trading up 0.7% in early trade, reversed course to end down 0.6%. For the first half of 2017, the benchmark S&P 500 is on track to advance about 9%, with some analysts suggesting that the second half will likely be positive as well. “When the 500’s first-half price gain was between 7% and 12%…the market went on to record an average price rise of 5.1% during the second half and posted a positive performance an above-average 87% of the time,” wrote Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, a market research firm. Stovall’s calculations would put the S&P 500 at 2,565 by the end of 2017. “While this forward six-month level for the S&P 500 approximates our 12-month target, based on current EPS and inflation projections, history implies that we may be underestimating the market’s rest-of-year potential,” Stovall said.

Both the dollar and Treasury yields weakened after the release of the report. Durable-goods orders slipped 1.1% last month following a similar drop in April, disappointing economists who expected a smaller decline. “After vast improvement at the start of the year, manufacturers have recorded fewer than expected durable-goods orders for the second consecutive month,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, in a note. “Short-lived optimism, no doubt, from pro-growth policies ushered in by the Trump administration have been replaced by a more lackluster reality of a little improved domestic growth and consumption profile.” Read: Want to know where the stock market’s headed over next 6 months?

Trey Williams,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 23, 2017 12:14 p.m. ET Netflix’s new show ‘GLOW,’ a fictionalized telling of the 1980s show the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, debuts Friday By Netflix Inc. has taken some heat lately for the shows it’s cut from the platform. But those moves, in theory, were made so that the streaming platform can produce shows like “GLOW,” which, if history tells us anything, likely will have a positive impact on the company’s earnings. The streaming giant premiered the debut season of “GLOW” — the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling — on Friday. According to analysts at Raymond James, Netflix’s

                                   share price sees a bigger post-earnings bump in quarters with new original shows than it does in quarters with hit originals. Raymond James analysts found a 0.4 correlation between hit original series and positive stock reaction, but the correlation rose to 0.7 when analysts looked only at series in their debut season. In short, new series outperform returning series on Netflix. “‘House of Cards’ is a great series, but if you didn’t join Netflix for seasons two through four, you are probably not joining for season five,” lead analyst Justin Patterson wrote in a note. “Conversely, ‘Stranger Things’ and ‘13 Reasons Why’ represented hits in different genres for Netflix, which likely led to new subscribers joining.” So it makes sense that Netflix would cancel exorbitantly expensive shows “Sense8” and “The Get Down” to free up coin and space for other content. Also see: Netflix has to cancel shows because not even it can keep spending like this Check out: Should Netflix consider heading to Broadway for its next genre challenge? With a $6 billion content budget, Netflix already outspends its streaming and network competitors, so it has the cash. However, the industry is bumping up against the peak TV ceiling. There were 455 scripted TV shows last year and that number has been expected to close in on 500 in 2017. But there are still only so many hours in the day that viewers can spend watching TV, so it does little good to continue to feed the content beast. In Patterson’s view, Netflix is taking the right approach by canceling shows that aren’t meeting the cost vs. viewership expectations. To judge, Raymond James analysts analyzed Google Trends data for some of Netflix’s canceled shows compared with “House of Cards” and found significantly lower activity for the canceled shows from January 2014 to June 2017. Since Netflix doesn’t release viewership data for its shows, Patterson suggested Google Trends could be used as a proxy for what people are watching and talking about.

The show has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. “If the initial critics are right, this could be a new hit for Netflix and carry some momentum for the company in the 2017 third quarter. “We believe Netflix is being disciplined on original content investment and has potential content catalysts in the second half of 2017 that could drive net add upside.

He answered with a lighthearted “Chick-fil-A,” and then said he would buy his wife “something nice.” But then he said she’d rather he didn’t and that “she still gets coupons…she gets online and tries to find discounts and none of that’s going to change.” “The exciting thing for me, money-wise, honestly, is that this money is going to help a lot of people,” he added. He said he’s been tithing since he got scholarship money in college, and that won’t change now. Derek (@derekcarrqb), now that you're the highest paid player in NFL history, what are you going to buy? pic.twitter.com/q4QbyRwtM0 Carr, 26, signed a $125 million, five-year contract on June 22. The contract pays him more in the later years of the deal, possibly because the team will be moving to Las Vegas in 2020, where there is no state income tax — so Carr would get to keep more of his salary in those years. Many athletes are in the news for making — and losing — millions. But there are increasingly more examples of professional athletes who do a lot to make sure their money will last long after they stop playing. Clearly Carr is an example of the latter. The NFL over the last few years has increased its efforts to help its athletes make their money last. For the last few years, it has held a personal finance camp for players as well as a Business Academy, the most recent of which was held at the University of Michigan in March. See: Why this former NFL star bought a Dunkin’ Donuts MarketWatch has spoken with several athletes who, like Carr, are smart with their money. For example, NFL star Brandon Flowers has made $50 million and only just recently bought his first house. In fact, money managers who work with professional athletes recently told MarketWatch it recommends that NBA rookies rent a home until they sign their second league contract. Regarding the generous tithing that Carr does, here’s a video of him talking about the time in college when he started living the Christian lifestyle.

Astrachan kept his buy recommendation on Costco but slashed his stock-price target to $173, which was 10.1% above current levels, from $191. “From a stock standpoint, while Amazon/Whole Foods will not impact near-term results, it is likely to impact industry trends longer-term, which uncertainty regarding strategic plans for the combined entity and the response from legacy participants, limiting multiple expansion, and share price upside, from current levels,” Astrachan wrote in a note to clients. He said that while Costco’s executives didn’t intend to make major changes in strategy in the wake of the Amazon–Whole Foods deal, they anticipated “accelerating measures to enhance the consumer value proposition.” Perfect timing, because a BMO Capital study, published just before the Amazon–Whole Foods deal was announced, showed that prices on Costco’s website were 17% lower than those on Amazon.com, giving Costco a “big opportunity” online. Don’t miss: Costco’s online prices are lower than Amazon’s, study finds. So while Astrachan acknowledged that the uncertainty surrounding the effects of the Amazon–Whole Foods merger will weigh on the grocery sector, Costco, in his view, is likely to outperform its peer group, given its “competitive advantage, including an increased focus on e-commerce and fresh food strategies.” Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sara Sjolin,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 27, 2017 7:51 a.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By It’s beginning to feel like a summer lull out there for markets. But a herd of Fed speakers — including Janet Yellen — could break the pre-holiday spell and deliver a last-minute shake-up as this year’s first half wraps up today. Stocks don’t necessarily deserve a boost, with the Dow and S&P on track for their best first half in four years. And the Nasdaq is flirting with its biggest gain since 2003 (though techs don’t look too frisky in the early going). So, where to invest for the second half? Well, there’s lots of chatter about real estate investment trusts, aka REITs, after yesterday’s news that Warren Buffett has taken a big stake in Store Capital

                                   . REITs can yield big profits — but only if you know which ones to buy, say Bespoke Investment Group analysts for our call of the day. “While the shopping mall REITs have been tanking, the REITs that lease out warehouses to tech companies that need space to house all of their servers and cloud data have been surging,” Bespoke’s team says. “The ten best-performing REITs in 2017 are all in strong uptrends, with the exception of GEO and QCP. If you’re a trend investor, you’ll like these charts,” the analysts add.

Traditional retail real estate such as malls, however, face “Death by Amazon” as shoppers shift online. That means investors should avoid that type of building, according to Bespoke. “While there has been lots of brainstorming about what to do with malls that often look like ghost towns these days, we haven’t seen any convincing ideas yet (except maybe turning them into tech data centers!),” the analysts say. One of Bespoke’s picks also gets praise from Forbes and Seeking Alpha scribe Brad Thomas, who singles out CareTrust

                                   as a “REIT gem” set for relatively speedy earnings growth. As for Buffett’s REIT pick, that’s along the lines of what Bespoke is backing — less than 20% of Store’s portfolio is in traditional retail.

Sarah Kent,06292017,MarketWatch,06222017,"Published: June 29, 2017 1:51 p.m. ET By LONDON -- BP PLC said Thursday it will write off $750 million from its second quarter earnings as a result of poor exploration results in Angola, an oil-rich country that the company has touted as a pillar of its business. The British oil-and-gas company said it would give up its 50% stake in a license off the African country's south coast after deciding it wasn't worth developing a 2014 gas discovery there. BP said additional exploration write-offs in the country will also contribute to the charge, without giving more details. The shift in exploration strategy comes as BP is working to rebuild the company in the wake of its fatal blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and a three-year plunge in oil prices that has rocked the entire industry. After years of retrenchment, it is now back on the path to growth with plans to add 800,000 barrels a day of new oil and gas production by 2020. By the end of the decade, including its stake in Russian oil giant POA Rosneft, it expects to be pumping 4 million barrels a day -- as much as before the 2010 disaster. BP said the $750 million noncash charge won't be tax deductible, but it also won't affect the company's cash flow for the quarter -- an increasingly important metric for investors worried about oil firms' ability to cover spending and dividend payouts with oil prices stuck below $50 a barrel. BP has operated in Angola for decades and counts its operations there as some of its most important. When BP gained access to deepwater and ultra deepwater exploration licenses off the country's coast in 2011, it described the acquisition as a ""major win."" Since then, priorities have changed following a precipitous drop in oil prices. Companies are increasingly moving away from expensive exploration in frontier regions, like parts of the Angola that remain relatively unexplored, to focus on areas where they already have operations and knowledge of the geology they are working with. BP said the decision to write off its Angolan assets is part of a broader portfolio review, intended to focus the company more on natural gas and lower-cost oil projects near existing infrastructure. Those types of investments are expected to make the company more resilient in a world where oil prices remain low and more countries shift to lower carbon energy sources like gas and renewables. The company pointed to its decision last year to scrap controversial plans to explore in pristine waters off the coast of Australia. ""We are making disciplined choices throughout our business,"" BP's exploration and production chief Bernard Looney said. ""We are choosing not to pursue activities that we don't think will deliver maximum value for our shareholders.""
