ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales.

The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years.

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years.

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years.

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand.

Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.
