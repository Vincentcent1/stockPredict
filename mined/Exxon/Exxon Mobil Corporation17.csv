,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"BRIGHTON, Colo. (Reuters) - The Colorado man arrested for fatally shooting three people in a Walmart in suburban Denver made his initial court appearance on Friday. Scott Ostrem, 47, was captured on Thursday, the day after he “nonchalantly” entered the Thornton, Colorado, Walmart and opened fire on shoppers and employees shortly after 6 p.m. MDT (midnight GMT), police said. Thornton is about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of downtown Denver. Wearing a light blue jail jumpsuit and faded red flip flops, Ostrem, in handcuffs and shackles, said yes four times when Judge Ted Tow asked if he understood his rights during the 10-minute hearing at the Adams County District Court in Brighton, Colorado. The judge ordered that Ostrem continue to be held without bond in the Adams County jail. Formal filing of charges will be made at the next hearing on Monday. Adams County District Attorney Dave Young said “multiple counts” would be filed. He declined to discuss specifics of the case, but said he had met with victims’ families after the hearing. “They are all shattered and in shock,” he said. Tow denied a request by Ostrem’s attorney, public defender Emily Fleischmann, to have police again close off the Walmart store where the shooting occurred to prevent the destruction of evidence, saying he lacked the authority to order that. The store has not reopened, said Fleischmann, who did not speak to reporters after the hearing. Two men were killed in the shooting and a woman who was shot died at a local hospital, police said. No one else was wounded. The victims were identified as Pamela Marques, 52, Carlos Moreno, 66 and Victor Vasquez, 26. Moreno’s family attended the hearing. They were carrying a sign that read “#Justice4CarlosMoreno,” but it was not allowed in the courtroom. They declined to talk to reporters. Police said they have yet to establish a motive for the rampage and that Ostrem had only “a minimal criminal history.” Early accounts of multiple casualties revived painful memories for the Denver area. In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people at a midnight screening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises” at a theater in the suburb of Aurora. The shooter, James Holmes, is serving a dozen consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. In 1999, two 12th-graders fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher at Columbine High School in suburban Jefferson County. The pair, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, then committed suicide in the campus library. ","

,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"BRIGHTON, Colo. (Reuters) - A Colorado man who prosecutors say walked into a Walmart store in a Denver suburb and opened fire seemingly at random, killing three people, was charged on Monday with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Scott Ostrem, 47, was told during a brief hearing in Adams County District Court in Brighton that he had been charged with six counts of murder and 30 counts of attempted murder. The six murder counts include two for each slain victim, under different legal theories. No one else was wounded in the attack, but prosecutors said the attempted murder charges referred to other people in the store who could have been struck by gunfire. The charges could make Ostrem eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted. Adams County District Attorney Dave Young told reporters outside court that he had not decided whether to seek it. “The (victims’) families will certainly be a part of that determination,” Young said, adding that additional charges could be filed in the case. The defendant, who was shackled and dressed in yellow and white jail garb, gave one-word answers to the judge. He did not enter a plea. Police said they had yet to establish a motive for the rampage last Wednesday, which took place amid a string of U.S. mass shootings that have renewed calls for restrictions on gun ownership. Early accounts of multiple casualties also revived painful memories for the Denver area. In 2012, a gunman killed 12 people at a midnight screening of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises” at a theater in the suburb of Aurora. The shooter, James Holmes, is serving a dozen consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.

But its popularity has been on the wane with the rise of online shopping and inexpensive deals throughout the year. The holiday shopping season, which runs through Christmas on Dec. 25, can account for as much as 40 percent of retailers’ annual sales. Steve Bratspies, Wal-Mart’s chief merchandising officer, told reporters on a conference call that the retailer is prepared to draw in shoppers this holiday season. “We know the categories and items customers are looking for, have focused our assortment on those top items, pricing them so we cannot be beat and buying deep to ensure more availability,” he said.

Lauren Thomas,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Wal-Mart isn't making any big changes to its Black Friday store hours this year, as some other retailers have, and you won't need a wristband to snag the biggest deals. In line with last year, the big-box retailer's website on turkey day will kick off its online Black Friday sale at 12:01 a.m. ET. That's hours before its in-store doorbuster deals begin at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving evening. Wal-Mart stores will remain open all day Friday. Select deals will also go live on Walmart.com this Thursday. Those deals, available until Nov. 12, include an Acer Aspire ES Laptop for $449, a Sky Rider Falcon 2 Pro Drone for $29.97, and a Kingsford 32-inch charcoal grill for $99. This marks the third year Wal-Mart has offered a majority of its Black Friday promotions online, as consumers are increasingly dividing their budgets between stores and the web. Last year's  Adobe Digital Index Report showed consumers spent $91.7 billion online in the U.S. alone, an 11 percent jump from the year before. This year, Adobe is projecting that number to surpass $100 billion. And for the 2017 holidays, consumers are expected for the first time to spend more of their budgets online than in stores, according to an annual survey by Deloitte. Internet sites and mass merchants remain shoppers' favored destinations, but e-retailers are widening their lead over other formats, Deloitte found. ""What [shoppers] buy will be largely determined by the digital interactions occurring now,"" said Rod Sides, leader of Deloitte's U.S. retail, wholesale and distribution team. Retailers including Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, Kohl's, Target and Sears are, in turn, beefing up their online offerings ahead of the holidays. New this year, Wal-Mart will no longer be handing out wristbands in advance of Black Friday for coveted items like TVs and iPads. In 2014, Wal-Mart called its holiday strategy the ""New Black Friday,"" where it hoped to trim back the number of shoppers standing in line for ""nothing."" But that method was short-lived. ""We feel good about inventory"" this year, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said on a call with the media. ""We don't think we need wristbands this year."" Some of Wal-Mart's top Black Friday deals in 2017 include a Hatchimals Golden Lynx Egg for $49.88, a Frozen Sleigh 12-Volt Ride-On for $198, a Samsung 65-inch Class Curved 4K Smart TV for $998, the Google Home Mini for $29 — which also comes with a $25 shopping coupon — and the PlayStation 4 1TB Console for $199. Bratspies said Wal-Mart has stocked enough kids pajamas this holiday season to reach from Miami to Seattle. Best Buy, a close competitor to Wal-Mart in the electronics department, is set to open its doors on Thanksgiving at 5 p.m., as it did last year.

Zack Guzman,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"It seems too easy to be true that you could make millions by raiding the clearance aisle at your local Walmart or Target and then selling your haul on Amazon. But that's exactly what 28-year-old Ryan Grant is doing. Only four years after quitting his accounting job in Minneapolis, Minn., to flip purchases full-time, his business is making well into the six figures in profits per year. ""Pretty early on I realized I wasn't in the career path that I wanted to be on,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""That experience really had me looking for other options and I was starting to explore ways that I could basically leave that job and have my own schedule and be on my own time."" To do that, Grant turned to the side hustle he had used to made ends meet in college. As a student at Winona State University, he organized textbook buyback events on campus twice a year. He listed the books on Amazon and shipped them out to customers around the country for a profit of up to $10,000 a year. The process worked simply enough: Using the Amazon Seller app he could see exactly how much he could expect to profit on each book and in what time frame. But the hours spent processing and packaging each order himself proved to be a bit much. ""Going through that process for one semester was enough to know that I didn't want to do it again,"" he says. ""From there forward I did Fulfillment by Amazon the rest of the way."" Using Amazon's fulfillment services meant he could ship all the books in bulk using preferred UPS rates to an Amazon warehouse, where, for a fee, the online retailer handled processing and shipping out each individual order. It made his side hustle more manageable, time-wise. And, when Grant grew more unfulfilled at his accounting job, it sparked the idea of going online to flip more than just textbooks. After work and on the weekends, he scoped out the clearance aisles at Walmart, scanned a few items using Amazon's app and bought up toys, games, and home improvement items he realized he could re-sell for a profit. A receipt from his early days shows a variety of purchases, everything from vacuums to Barbies, LEGO sets to stainless steel flatware. ""I was putting in about 10 hours per week and I was making in the ballpark of $1,000 per month,"" he recalls. Once he was able to make the same kind of money reselling on Amazon as he had made at his accounting job, in September 2013, he quit. ""I was confident that if I had full-time hours to dedicate to selling online that I would be able to more or less scale that up,"" Grant says. Just three months later, in December, he notched $9,000 in profit on over $25,000 in total sales. ""Making that amount of money in one month was a big boost in my confidence to be able to scale up further from there,"" he says. Boxes upon boxes destined for Amazon warehouses started stacking up in Grant's duplex so, in the spring of 2014, he rented out a 725-foot warehouse. He packed his Mazda 626 full of products on runs back and forth from other brand-name retailers like Target and Toys R Us. ""It was starting to basically take over my life because I'm coming home and there's product all over my house,"" he recalls. When the 30 hours of shopping and the 15 hours of preparing shipments each week became too much to handle alone, Grant hired his first employee, a friend who could help scour local stores. Eventually it got easier to target the items that had the biggest opportunity for arbitrage. Seasonality, they realized, was a key factor. They could, for example, buy up discounted candy after Halloween and half-priced Christmas decorations around the New Year. ""Believe it or not, there's actually people buying those items out of season,"" Grant laughs. Still, even he was surprised at how quickly the business took off from there. ""I went from just me in this business doing around three-to-five thousand dollars in sales per month and now, four years later, we're a team of 11 and we're doing well over $200,000 in sales per month,"" Grant says. The team had to move to a warehouse that's over five times as large as their first this past July. Since he started selling on Amazon, Grant says the business is on track to top $8 million in total sales by the end of this year. Profits are heavily reinvested back into the company, though Grant was still able to take a salary of around $150,000 when he was working for the venture full time. The team also made mistakes made along the way. They lost $6,000 when a faulty nail filing product for dogs got Grant's Amazon seller account temporarily suspended, for example. They also had to pay the fees Amazon charges for products that failed to sell and sat idly in Amazon's warehouses. All the same, Grant believes he has found an easy and effective formula for success. ""I think anyone can do it if they're willing to put in the work,"" he says. As his business is increasingly run by his team, Grant has reduced his salary down to $60,000 a year and now dedicates much of his time to getting that message out. He consults and teaches e-commerce classes through the same blog he has been using to track his performance. His hope is that he might be able to help a few people who might not be happy at their jobs find the same independence he did. ""I was just looking to have freedom of schedule and replace the income that I had from that job and now it's turned into a lot more than that,"" he says. ""I mean, I would be sitting in an office cubicle now or working at a client location as opposed to doing what I want to do effectively when I want to do it."" —Video by CNBC's Zack Guzman Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

Steve Odland and Ethan Cramer-Flood,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"As Donald Trump prepares to meet China's president Xi Jinping, a lightning rod of 2017 is on his  agenda: trade. Populist politicians have long opined on how U.S. trade policies with China have hurt certain American constituencies – namely, small businesses and factory workers. While these accusations largely ring true, the current protectionist policies under consideration risk generating blowback for another important economic faction: large American multinational corporations, which play a significant role in driving the U.S. economy. If a trade war unfolded, this constituency would stand to lose the most. Many of America's biggest brands have considerable investment footprints in China: Nike, Walmart, Apple – the list goes on. These companies would stand at the front of the firing line if China reciprocated against any major trade actions by the U.S. Depending on the nature of the retaliation, expect revenues, profits, and share prices to suffer. Collateral impacts would include company workers in America, local economies where the companies reside, and the pension and retirement fund holdings invested in them. The risks involved run deeper than reciprocal tariffs and trade restrictions. At the heart of corporate America's concern is future access to the Chinese market. Already, China is heading in the wrong direction here, as its policy environment has become increasingly hostile to the private sector and the foreign investors within it. A trade war could be the final straw that leads Beijing to severely contain American corporate interests in China, if not close off the market altogether. For many U.S. companies, China is their No.2 market and revenue-generator in the world. For some, it is already No.1. Therefore, any new barriers that emerge from a trade war domino effect would devastate American business. On both sides, economic hostility has been driven recently by accusations, counter-accusations, and ongoing investigations into China's practice of coercing American companies to hand over advanced technology and other intellectual property as a price for doing business. The U.S. Trade Representative's ongoing investigation into these shenanigans has illuminated the ways China's regulators railroad U.S. corporations. During open hearings in October, voice after voice recounted examples of American firms essentially forced into disadvantageous commercial arrangements with Chinese partners – the localization of customer data, software source codes, core intellectual property rights – because Chinese law often requires such provisions before regulators will grant operating rights. Why do major American companies allow themselves to be perennially manipulated by the Chinese government into forgoing their hard-earned innovations? Because Beijing is masterful at playing one company against the other, and Chinese leaders know multinational corporations cannot resist the lure of China's consumers. Thus, companies compromise to gain access, for fear if they don't play ball someone else will. Adding to the complications, American multinationals also find themselves dealing with an administration focused more on investments inside the U.S. and less on supporting U.S. industry abroad. For example, negotiations over a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) have gone moribund, despite a U.S.-China BIT arguably ranking as corporate America's top policy priority in the relationship. Moreover, many multinational corporations thought the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be a strong bulwark to help normalize China's trade and investment practices. Despite the uncertainty on the U.S. side, America has more opportunity to push back on China's leaders than it did a decade ago. The days of China's double-digit growth figures are gone, permanently, making the risk of heightened tensions less dangerous for business than in the past. China is no longer a wonderland of easy growth and easy profits, so some leverage has shifted back to American negotiators. Additionally, China's investments abroad have skyrocketed – particularly in the U.S. – creating a mutual incentive for keeping doors open. This week in Beijing, some pushing from the Trump side could help in cajoling China into improving market-access conditions for foreign companies. However, if threats and heated rhetoric turn into painful protectionist U.S. policies down the road, ""face issues"" for China would likely come into play and lead Beijing to institute retaliatory actions – step one towards a trade war. It behooves American business to ensure its voice is heard now and heard clearly, without the mixed messages of the past. In this way, the populist proposals kicking around Washington can be handled moderately, to help bring about positive change rather than a downward spiral.

""The thing with these high momentum stocks is they could do nothing for months at a time, but the longer-term strength ultimately continues higher and I think that's what's going on for Activision."" While the video game maker has traded between $60 and $66 since July, Wald pointed to three key factors that he thinks will ultimately get the stock to break out.

Jordan Novet,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Facebook is trying to show that it's serious about snagging business users, and Dreamforce is the place to do it. On Tuesday, the company talked up its Workplace by Facebook offering at Salesforce's annual software conference in San Francisco. While Facebook's core business is ads that target consumers, the company doesn't want to cede the work market to Slack, Microsoft and HipChat from Atlassian. Facebook said in a blog post that it's teaming up with Salesforce to improve its Workplace service, which is a version of the social network that's designed for use by working teams. The partnership, first announced in April, is designed to bring Salesforce's enterprise software tools into Facebook. In particular, Facebook is focused on making collaboration smoother by integrating Salesforce's Quip word processing and spreadsheet tools. There will be buttons for uploading documents to Quip as well as creating new documents, along with a list of all available files. ""These improvements will make it easier for teams collaborate, edit, and work together on documents,"" Facebook wrote in the blog post. ""So they can work faster and get more done."" Workplace by Facebook also has integrations with Box, Dropbox, Google's G Suite and Microsoft's Office and OneDrive. Facebook introduced the app in 2015 and said last month that 30,000 organizations, including Walmart, are using it. Working with Salesforce on Quip is a natural move for Facebook. Bret Taylor, the CEO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired last year, was previously Facebook's chief technology officer. ",Facebook is serious enough about its work product to show up at Dreamforce
Heidi Chung,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"Snap is soaring ahead of its earnings Tuesday after the bell, and traders are expecting an even bigger move for the stock following its report. Since Snap's IPO on March 2, shares have fallen more than 12 percent. As the company gears up for its third earnings report as a public company, the options market is implying about a 13 percent move in either direction. Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com pointed out on CNBC's ""Options Action"" on Monday that after past earnings reports, Snap shares fell steeply the following day. The stock tumbled 21 percent the day following its first report and 14 percent following its second report. In comparison, rival Twitter also saw very large moves following its first two earnings reports. Shares dropped 24 percent following its first earnings report in February 2014 and then fell 9 percent after its second report. Meanwhile, Facebook's stock sunk 12 percent after its first earnings release, but then jumped 19 percent after its second. Nathan pointed out that the implied move of about 13 percent, or $2, could potentially place the stock at around $17. ""If you look at this chart, $17 is significant. That was the IPO price, [and] that was also the September high. That $2 from here looks to be resistance, [and] the September low is also $2 lower.""On Monday, the most active strikes were the Nov. 10 weekly 20 and 21 calls, meaning traders see Snap shares closing above $20 by Friday, which is 30 percent higher than Tuesday's trading price.According to FactSet, analysts are expecting Snap to report an earnings loss of 33 cents on $237 million of revenue.

Michelle Castillo,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"With so many apps out there, it's hard to get noticed. ""When you have over 2 million apps in the iOS app store, how you get your app downloaded verses other apps becomes important,"" said Amir Ghodrati, director of market insights for App Annie. Developers have come up with tactics to get their apps to number one in Apple's App Store and Google Play, the store for Android devices. Here are some tricks App Annie has noticed. Users are likely to download the first result when they are searching for a specific app. Sixty-five percent of app downloads come from searches in the App Store, according to App Annie. ""With iOS search ads introduced last year, people are basically looking for key words they think are going to be popular and then paying money to pay to rank to the top spot,"" Ghodrati said. Many companies buy their own names in order to ensure they have the top spot. Smaller companies might use popular companies to boost their popularity, such as Motif Fashion & Jewelry buying an ad on the term ""Etsy."" Occasionally, rivals will purchase a competitor's name in order to appear above the official app in search results, such as Walmart advertising on the ""Target"" search term: Or  Amazon advertising on the ""Walmart"" search term: Or Lyft advertising for drivers on the ""Uber"" search term. App Annie noticed many apps changing their name or image icon to fit seasonal events like Christmas, Halloween or Valentine's Day. However, the most popular event to inspire a name change is Black Friday. A coupon and local deal app called Retale updated its name to ""Black Friday 2016: Ads, Shopping Deals & Coupons"" a few weeks before the big shopping day. It rose from number 7 to number 3 in its category and retained third place through Cyber Monday, according to App Annie. Over the week of Black Friday, Retale saw a 100 percent increase in daily downloads over the two prior weeks, App Annie noted. This season, Wal-Mart has updated its icon to a present, added snow to its screenshots and added the line ""Our elves have been hard at work so you'll save time during the holidays and every day"" to its version notes. The app description also updated to include information about free shipping and using your phone to pay at the store quickly. In order to reach the top spot, some apps will change their category to rank higher. Since there are so many social networking apps and Instagram and Snap dominate the category, many search for another affiliated vertical. For instance, Twitter switched from social networking to news in April 2016, and has since been leading the news category. There are always several buzz words floating around the tech scene. Thanks to the iPhone X, the app keyword search volume for ""augmented reality"" has gone up 25 percent month over month, according to App Annie. As a response, it saw many companies are adding the words ""augmented reality"" or specifically mentioning iOS 11 in their descriptions and functionalities. For example, Amazon's latest update highlights the fact it allows for augmented reality furniture placement so you can see products in your room before you buy them. But because so many developers are adding augmented reality to their descriptions, companies that use that term are finding it more difficult to rise in the ranks. It is 14 percent more difficult in the App Store and 37 percent harder in the Google Play store to move up spots by using ""augmented reality"" since the iPhone X was announced in September, App Annie said. ","Apps raise their rankings in the Apple App Store, Google Play"
Thomas Franck,11092017,CNBC,11022017,"New research has found that U.S. retailers charge nearly identical prices across stores, despite wide variation in customer income and local demographics. And by holding prices steady across locations, retailers significantly increase the prices paid by poorer households relative to the rich as a percentage of total income. The uniform pricing also ends up costing firms nearly 7 percent of profits on average because they lose out on higher prices they could charge the wealthy and lower volume for lower-income consumers. In a working paper filed with the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists Stefano DellaVigna of UC Berkeley and Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University reported their findings. For the food stores studied, customers of stores in the lowest income decile pay about 0.7 percent higher prices than they would under flexible prices, while customers of stores in the top income decile pay roughly 9 percent lower prices, according to the research. Gentzkow, who's been a professor at Stanford for two years, underscored that classical economics predicts that companies adjust prices in response to surges or contractions in demand or income. That is, firms take advantage of people who want a particular good more than others and exploit populations with higher income levels. The researchers studied data from tens of thousands of stores in the Nielsen Retailer Scanner to extract information on weekly prices from firms while using Consumer Panel data from the University of Chicago to study customer income trends. The team focused on three store types: 9,415 food stores, 9,977 drugstores and 3,288 mass merchandise stores. ""We view this sharp contrast between within- and between-chain results as one of our key findings. It suggests that chains are either varying their prices for too little across stores in response to income, or varying their prices far too much at the overall chain level,"" wrote the economists in their paper. Their research found an increase in per capita income of $10,000 for localities — equivalent to a move from the 30th to the 75th percentile — is associated with an increase in price of just 0.72 percent. ""The thing that makes it surprising to us is that those stores typically have very different consumers,"" Gentzkow told CNBC in an interview. ""Econ 101 would tell you that inequality in incomes is going to be offset because poor people are going to end up paying lower prices."" The paper doesn't go into much on the reasons why retailers are charging the same everywhere, but it's likely that access to Amazon and Google pricing comparison tools on a consumer's smartphone is playing a role. DellaVigna and Gentzkow suggest it may have more to do with managers at chain stores being reluctant to adjust prices for their location. ""Change may impose additional costs, as managers may not be well incentivized to make the change, while fearing the cost if a change backfires,"" wrote the team. But stores may be reluctant to give that power to individual locations with Amazon available to ship anywhere easily at a lower price. ""I think it's plausible that if one of these stores said now were going to start varying the prices in their stores it would come at managerial costs,"" Gentzkow told CNBC. Plus ""people might be upset if they realize you were change the price in one store in not another."" Another important effect is that floating prices help mitigate the negative impact of local economic shocks; even when the population experiences a hit to income, reductions in local retail prices would naturally offset the damage. However, fixed prices as observed by the researchers diminish this helpful response. ","Retailers are charging the same prices across US, boosting income inequality, new research shows"

Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"The U.S. has a pressing need to bolster its weak cybersecurity in the face of huge breaches like Russia's suspected sabotage of the election system and Yahoo's billion-user hack, Ret. Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.  ","We're headed at a 'cyber Pearl Harbor,' says Adm James Stavridis"
John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump
Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"With oil and gas becoming top priorities for economic growth in the incoming administration and the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC member countries to cut production, oil and gas prices will rise, Hess CEO John Hess told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly. ""It's clear that the Trump administration puts a high priority on energy, that oil and gas are engines of economic growth going forward,"" Hess said.

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images.

Brett Arends,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 14, 2016 12:34 p.m. ET His billionaire and multimillionaire picks will enrich themselves through a special IRS code By Have you heard about the latest tax shelter for the super-rich? It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable?

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

                                    , Trump’s secretary of state nominee, will be required to divest assets that could conflict with their duties and substitute other permitted assets such as Treasury bonds and diversified index funds. In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

                                   , or 1.22%, according to the latest proxy statement. Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee.

Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.
