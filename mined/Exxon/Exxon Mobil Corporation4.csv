,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"LONDON (Reuters) - The West’s three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbors. Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years. The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM] Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk. “There is only one policy here – you have to behave like a commercial corporation,” the executive told Reuters. “You have to make your choices purely economically and be Qatari in Qatar, Emirati in the Emirates.” Energy sales have powered Qatar’s rapid rise as a regional  player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors’ interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbors. Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks. Qatar, the world’s largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher. The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha’s response to their grievances had been negative. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said. Doha denies aiding terrorism and its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused the four of “clear aggression” while adding that Qatar continued to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. [nL8N1JW27A] [nL8N1JW1Y1] Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible. Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing “cooperation” with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency. Industry sources close to the talks said that “the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest”. Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar’s LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year. Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie. Shell’s Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world’s largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019. Shell’s operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world’s largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio. The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world’s biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said. Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar’s North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4] Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company’s plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source. Qatar’s LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimizing existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as “debottlenecking”, according to a senior industry source. Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer. “Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there,” Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said. “Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals.” ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"HANOI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Vietnam has extended an Indian oil concession in the South China Sea and begun drilling in another area it disputes with China in moves that could heighten tensions over who owns what in the vital maritime region. The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing’s relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China’s energy supplies and trade passes. Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company’s managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters. Part of that block is in the U-shaped ‘nine-dash line’ which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for  more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims. A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential. “Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China’s interventions in the South China Sea,” the official said. Vietnam’s state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June. Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold. Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam’s state oil firm, Spain’s Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates. Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd., has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain’s Repsol SA, which also has rights to neighboring block 07/03, Odfjell said. Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China’s claims. Odfjell’s Eirik Knudsen, V‎ice President for Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, referred further queries to Repsol, which declined to comment. PetroVietnam made no comment. When asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone “carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over”. “We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation,” he told a briefing in Beijing. Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was canceled around the time the drilling began. The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade. Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion “Blue Whale” gas concession off central Vietnam. They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam’s evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam’s coastguard. Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said. “We know they are unhappy again, but we are resisting the pressure – it is a traditional part of our relations with Beijing,” one official said privately. “Other parts of the relationship remain strong.” Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea. Hanoi’s growing defense and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances. The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China’s expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia. India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam’s waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country. On the agenda are transfers of naval vessels and missiles under a $500 million defense credit line announced last year. Next week, the navies of India, the United States and Japan will hold their largest joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal. ","

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry’s vulnerability to cyber attacks. Since at least May, hackers used tainted “phishing” emails to “harvest credentials” so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims. “Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,” the report said. Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28. The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity. A virus dubbed “NotPetya” attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators. Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants. The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations. Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine. Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear program. The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create “decoy documents” on topics of interest to their targets. In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim’s computers and travel across their networks.

,07062017,Reuters,06292017,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Investors are slowly starting to push companies to reduce their carbon footprint and help the world meet targets on limiting global warming that were agreed in the 2015 Paris climate talks. Energy firms have faced shareholder demands to do more to curb carbon emissions, while some pension funds are demanding more commitment to climate goals from firms they invest in. Yet progress has still been modest since the Paris deal agreed by almost 200 nations came into force in November last year, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. “Lots of investors are looking to align their investments with a 2 degrees world. It’s just at what pace they all get there,” said Fiona Reynolds, managing director at the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Advocates of the climate deal hope new impetus will come from Thursday’s document published by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a group set up by G20 nations. The task force’s document outlines a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, drawing support from more than 100 companies with $11 trillion of assets. It aims to help investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders understand how firms manage climate risk and guide companies on information they should provide to explain their climate strategy, ultimately helping ensure corporate laggards are held to account. “The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement,” said Philippe Desfossés, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP. Sweden’s largest national pension fund AP7 set a high benchmark in June when it named six companies it said had breached the Paris accord, and ditched them from its portfolio. Several energy firms have faced shareholder rebellions at annual general meetings over their stance on climate change. ExxonMobil XON.N has been accused of misleading investors by a U.S. prosecutor, allegations the U.S. firm has dismissed as “frivolous”. Many energy firms have been sharing more information on their climate strategies, and some mining companies are starting to follow suit, such as iron ore miner Vale VALE5.SA. In a Reuters survey, 13 leading public and corporate pension schemes in Europe, Asia and North America managing a total $1.1 trillion said they were committed to engaging firms on their climate strategy. Three of those funds said explicitly that divestment was an option if talks were unsatisfactory. However, some funds said the threat of divestment was not the best approach to encouraging firms to improve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. “We think engagement investment is about promoting companies to be involved with ESG through engagement,” said Hiroichi Yagi, an adviser to the pension fund of Japan’s Secom, a leading security firm. “If you just sell and stop investing in companies that are not mindful of climate change, then you are abandoning engagement there,” he said, adding that he was not aware of any Japanese pension funds advocating divestment as an option. To date, most divestments have tended to be from companies mining coal, the dirtiest energy source. Some large investors, such as Norway’s $960-billion sovereign wealth fund, have set limits on how much revenues can come from that source. The most active asset owners on climate change have tended to be big pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds - Norway’s and New Zealand’s have reduced exposure to fossil fuels. Such firms have more in-house analysts to assess investments. Smaller funds are making slower progress in pushing climate issues up the agenda in determining investment policy. A survey by consultants Mercer of 1,241 European pension schemes, half of which had less than 100 million euros ($114 million) in assets, showed just 5 percent considered the financial impact of climate change on their portfolios. However, that was up from 4 percent a year earlier. “It’s ironic that the pace of response to this enormous issue is best described as glacial, outside a small group of leading funds,” said Phil Edwards, Mercer’s Global Director of Strategic Research, calling for more “urgency” to be applied. Advocates of the Paris accord hope the TFCD’s framework document will particularly assist smaller firms. Britain’s Environment Agency Protection Fund, a founder member of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) that aims to help asset owners assess firms, said more than 3 trillion pounds  ($3.9 trillion) of assets were now being invested using the TPI’s guidelines. “We are aiming to be one of the first asset owners to do this to show our support for the TCFD and its pick up by other asset owners,” said Faith Ward, the scheme’s chief responsible investment officer. She said her fund planned to link its annual report to the TCFD framework. ","

(AAPL). According to Calcbench, a research firm that analyzes financial data from the SEC, Apple has averaged $107.1 million in share repurchases daily since initiating its stock buyback program in August 2012. In sum, this means that the company has purchased $142 billion worth of its own stock during that period. For context, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), which is the second biggest purchaser of its own stock, averaged $42.4 million of stock repurchases per day and spent a total of $55.88 billion for the initiative between 2012 and 2017. In its latest earnings report, Apple announced that it had spent $151 billion on stock repurchases since August 2012. Its pace of buybacks has accelerated since 2015, when it had purchased $80 billion worth of its own stock from shareholders. Apple also announced during its latest earnings call that it was planning to increase its share repurchase program to $210 billion from the year-ago level of $175 billion. (See also: Why Would a Company Buy Back Its Own Shares?) The Cupertino, California-based company's stock price has appreciated by 68% from 2012 to 2017, after adjusting for a stock split that occurred in 2014. Share repurchases increase the value of outstanding shares because the total number of shares available decreases even as their price remains the same. For example, Apple had 6.6 billion of its shares trading in the markets in 2013. As of this May, that number is down to 5.2 billion. According to some estimates, the decline in the number of shares has translated to a 21% bump in earnings per share for the company. (For more on Apple's history of stock splits, check out: If You Had Invested Right After Apple's IPO.) Much of Apple's share repurchase program is financed from its overseas cash pile. Of the company's $250 billion in cash, 90% is estimated to be parked abroad. In recent times, criticism has mounted against the company for failing to make acquisitions of innovative startups or invest in improving its innovation track record through the use of its cash. Critics have charged the company with ""financial engineering"" through stock buybacks to boost its bottom line, especially in the face of declining enthusiasm for its iconic iPhone.

Thanks to years of wild spending on land and new wells, Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) vaulted up the leaderboard and became one of America's largest gas producers -- second only to ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). That rapid growth fueled an explosive rise in its stock price until oil and gas prices came crashing down, which knocked Chesapeake Energy to the brink of bankruptcy. However, by undertaking a score of strategic initiatives, the company has shored up its balance sheet, which now has it in the position to thrive at lower commodity prices. In fact, the company is planning to expand output by 5% to 15% annually through the end of the decade if prices cooperate. That outlook has investors growing bullish that Chesapeake Energy could fuel profits into their portfolios in the coming years. That said, as compelling as Chesapeake Energy's upside potential is, Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) expect to grow at a much faster pace in the coming years. Even better, those companies can do so with less risk, which should cause Chesapeake Energy bulls to take notice. Image source: Getty Images. One of the reasons investors are bullish on Chesapeake Energy is that it holds significant acreage positions in many of the country's fastest growing shale plays. However, one of the hindrances holding the company back from developing those assets is the debt on its balance sheet. While the company has cut debt by $2.6 billion over the past year and a half, it still has $9.1 billion remaining, which is too much debt for a company of its size in the current market environment. That's why investors who like Chesapeake's exposure to several shale plays should love Devon Energy since it also holds significant positions in most of the top shale plays, including the STACK play of Oklahoma, which is one of Chesapeake's emerging growth engines. In fact, Devon Energy controls the largest acreage position in the STACK, which when combined with its Permian Basin position, should fuel 13% to 17% oil production growth this year, and 20% growth in 2018. Contrast that with Chesapeake Energy, which only expects to deliver 10% oil growth this year, and that's off a lower base. One of the reasons Devon Energy can grow at a faster pace in the current market environment is its top-tier balance sheet. In fact, Devon has only slightly more debt at $10.3 billion but produces twice as much oil and gas as Chesapeake does on a daily basis. Furthermore, the bulk of its production comes from higher-margin liquids, which gives it more cash flow to cover its debt. That combination of greater growth with less financial risk makes Devon worth a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. Those higher drilling returns should enable EQT Corp to grow at a faster pace without spending any more capital. According to the company's projections, it can increase production by a more than 20% compound rate through the end of the decade, which trounces Chesapeake's forecast. Furthermore, EQT can finance that growth while living within cash flow, enabling it to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet. That combination of robust returns-driving growth with less financial risk makes it a compelling option for risk-averse investors. After nearly collapsing under the weight of its debt last year, Chesapeake Energy has come roaring back, thanks to a significant improvement in its financial situation and growth prospects. That said, as compelling as Chesapeake Energy might be for investors, Devon Energy and EQT Corp offer faster growth with lower risk because of their stronger balance sheets. That's why investors who are bullish on Chesapeake should take a closer look at what these two energy stocks have to offer. ","

Tyler Crowe,07062017,Fool,06292017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. This past quarter, BP (NYSE:BP) looked like it was on the precipice of something big. Not only were earnings starting to look better, but BP is about to enter a rather impressive growth phase as several major projects come on line. On the company's most recent conference call, BP CFO Brian Gilvary touched on this major growth phase and how it will impact the bottom line as well as the overall economics. And, of course, no BP discussion would be complete without some discussion of the Macondo oil spill and the ongoing costs. Here are several quotes from the company's most recent conference call that should help give you a better understanding of BP's mind-set headed into the rest of the year. Image source: Getty Images. BP has been waffling quite a bit lately on how it is planning for the future. Integrated majors typically use some future oil price as a means to develop budgets and value prospective finds. Less than a year ago, the company was looking to achieve a breakeven of $50-$55 per barrel of Brent crude. Then, last quarter, CEO Bod Dudley said that the corporation would be able to ""re-balance its financial framework"" at $60 a barrel. This past conference call, CFO Brian Gilvary added a few new numbers into the mix. As noted in February, based on our current planning assumptions, this is consistent with our organic cash balance point reducing steadily to around $35 to $40 per barrel over the period [2017-2021] with the recent portfolio additions adding even more resilience to the portfolio. If you are a little confused by all these numbers being thrown around, you aren't the only one. The difference here seems to be that, at present, an oil price of $50-$55 per barrel is enough to cover its current capital spending as well as its dividend payments. That $60 a barrel is sufficient to achieve both of these things as well as eliminate the scrip dividend and lower its total debt levels to the desired range of 20%-30% of the capital structure. Finally, that range of $35-$40 per barrel is what breakeven will be several years from now when many of its major capital projects have come on line and spending is lower. That last one is a little harder to believe, though, since the company will likely embark on new spending projects once those under construction come on stream. 2017 is slated to be a big year for BP's oil and gas production. By the end of the year, it expects to have seven major capital projects completed and producing. When asked what kind of impact that would have on the company's cash flow, Gilvary was pretty clear that it will lead to a significant bump in operational cash, and it will have an impact on breakeven prices. In terms of material cash flows, yes, it is in terms of the operating cash. It gets driven off the back of the seven major projects coming on stream this year. And so the way in which the year was always set up was that the operating cash flow would grow through the first, second, third, fourth quarter with the major piece coming through in the fourth quarter. And that's why by the time we get to the end of the year, you see our breakeven economics come down quite significantly. By material you should assume that number means bigger than $1 billion delta versus where we are in the first quarter by the time we get to the end of the year. It will probably be significantly above that. For a while now, one of the largest stains on BP's quarterly results has been its U.S. operations, notably its ventures into shale. It wasn't that long ago that the company internally spun off its Lower 48 operations into an independent business that runs within BP to better respond to the fast-paced nature of shale drilling. It hasn't worked out so well thus far. This past quarter, U.S. upstream operations only accounted for 12% of upstream earnings even though it was 30% of total production. When asked what the company's capital plans were for the U.S., here's what Gilvary had to say. In terms of U.S. onshore, we today have – I think we're now back up to about 12 rigs in the first quarter of 2017, versus 5 in the fourth quarter. You'll see that ramp-up as the team experiments within each of the basins. But we're now running 12 rigs. Cash breakeven on a full free cash basis has now come down almost half from the full year 2015 to where we are in the first quarter of 2017, down around $2.60 [per thousand cubic feet of gas] or that sort of level, in terms of cash breakeven. The thing that should be a little concerning here is that the company is still doing experimental drilling to determine the best path forward for shale. Compare that with ExxonMobil and Chevron, which both have plans to grow significantly in the Permian Basin over the next few years. Part of BP's slower response is that the company's shale assets are much more related to gas -- hence the breakeven results given in natural gas prices.  Still, BP is going to have to figure out how to turn these operations into higher rates of return, because they aren't getting it done today. At the top of the conference call, Gilvary said that BP's capital spending would likely be in the $15 billion to $16 billion range, which was the lower end of its initial projections. Those plans were contingent, of course, on oil prices in a certain range. When asked if there was room to cut spending or if this was about as low as it gets for the year, Gilvary said there was still some wiggle room. [W]e could take another $1 billion out if we had to at though – in that scenario. But all options are open to us at that point in terms of flexibility within the financial frame and what else we need to look at. But I think it's an unlikely scenario from where we are today. As you see demand grow, we expect crude stocks to come back into line. Actually, crude stocks will probably still be at the top end of their historic range by the end of this year. So I think something around $50, $55 a barrel seems a reasonable assumption on a point forward basis. If it drops below $50, we have further flexibility in terms of how we manage that. That last part is important because oil prices have dipped below that $50-a-barrel mark. Don't be surprised if we get a lower capital budget projection in the coming months. It seems that the Macondo well spill is the issue that just won't go away. While the company did settle with the U.S. government, which will involve annual payments for more than a decade, the company still has some outstanding claims from businesses that claimed the spill impacted their operations. These led to some large spill costs this year, but Gilvary noted that almost all claims have now been processed and that we can expect outlays related to the Macondo spill will decline soon. Of the 149,000 [claims], we're down to about 4,000, of which 3,000 are recycled claims that at one point have been rejected and have come back into the system through the process that's allowed. So I think we're down to less than 1,000 claims now in terms of closing that process out going forward – in terms of less than 1,000 claims that we haven't yet had line of sight of. So I think we're now finally into the tail around business economic loss claims. And in terms of Macondo – and therefore being able to quantify and price up what that looks like on a quarterly basis, we're much closer to now. Management expects that total costs for the Macondo in 2017 will be $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion depending on these claims. In 2018, costs will drop to $2 billion in 2019, and then down to $1 billion per year for several years starting in 2019. ","

It agreed with Venezuela’s argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures. “Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure,” Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote. “Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote.” Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options. Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case arose from Venezuela’s seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry. Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA. According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela’s payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion. Tuesday’s decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. The appeals court also said Exxon’s petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA. The case is Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-707. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"BlackRock said it supported the shareholder motions to press companies to develop or disclose policies geared to promote gender diversity. It did not name the companies it pushed but said the “majority” had boards of directors lacking women. “We’ve been particularly focused on increasing the number of women on U.S. boards because progress in the U.S. has been slower than in many other markets,” BlackRock said in a report it distributed. “Board diversity, particularly in terms of gender, is important from a sustainable investment perspective, given that diverse groups have been demonstrated to make better decisions,” it added. “This appears to be because they are better able to consider, where appropriate, alternatives to current strategies - a proposition that can ultimately lead to sustained value creation.” Women hold about a fifth of board seats in the S&P 500 .SPX index, according to Catalyst Inc, an advocacy group. BlackRock said it also voted against board members at five companies who sat on nominating committees but failed to respond to investors’ concerns about diversity. It was the first year the company “decided to vote against members of the nomination committee of men-only boards in a more systematic manner,” a spokesman said, although it had engaged on the topic of gender diversity for “many years.” The New York-based company manages more than $5.4 trillion in assets, many in index funds that buy broad swaths of the market, making it a top shareholder in most public companies. It has been pressured by activists and investors to back shareholder-fronted propositions and vote against obstinate boards to prompt better corporate citizenship. Chief Executive Larry Fink has encouraged executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than meeting short-term earnings targets. BlackRock’s own board includes 17 members, four of whom are women. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the FBI earned $9.2 million last year as a partner in an international law firm, where he worked for clients ranging from Credit Suisse Group and Wells Fargo to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Disclosure forms produced for the Office of Government Ethics show Christopher Wray is also expected to receive millions more in payments when he leaves the King & Spalding law firm on his confirmation as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The forms and a letter from Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus, a designated ethics official for the Justice Department, were made public ahead of Wray’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Wray would succeed James Comey, whom Trump fired in May. Lofthus said in his letter that Wray would not receive a bonus, severance or contingency fees on leaving his firm but would receive a refund of his money in the firm’s capital account and a final partnership share distribution, unless he decided to forfeit it. To satisfy ethics concerns, Wray will not participate for one year in FBI matters that involve companies or people represented by his former law firm, Lofthus said in his letter. He also will not participate in matters involving his former clients for a year, unless he obtains a prior authorization. Wray’s financial disclosure forms show he provided legal services to a number of large international corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Georgia-Pacific and SunTrust Banks He also provided legal services to Christie during the “Bridgegate” scandal in which two of the Republican governor’s former associates were convicted of plotting to close down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge for nearly a week in 2013 in an act of political retribution. If he is confirmed, Wray will have 90 days to dispose of millions of dollars worth of stock he owns in firms ranging from Apple Inc and American Airlines to Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil, Lofthus said. Wray served at the U.S. Justice Department from 2003 to 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department’s Enron task force. ","

,07132017,Reuters,07062017,"HANOI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Vietnam has extended an Indian oil concession in the South China Sea and begun drilling in another area it disputes with China in moves that could heighten tensions over who owns what in the vital maritime region. The moves come at a delicate time in Beijing’s relations with Vietnam, which claims parts of the sea, and India, which recently sent warships to monitor the Malacca Straits, through which most of China’s energy supplies and trade passes. Vietnam granted Indian oil firm ONGC Videsh a two-year extension to explore oil block 128 in a letter that arrived earlier this week, the state-run company’s managing director Narendra K. Verma told Reuters. Part of that block is in the U-shaped ‘nine-dash line’ which marks the vast area that China claims in the sea, a route for  more than $5 trillion in trade each year in which the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also have claims. A senior official of ONGC Videsh, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said interest in the block was strategic rather than commercial, given that oil development there was seen as high-risk with only moderate potential. “Vietnam also wants us to be there because of China’s interventions in the South China Sea,” the official said. Vietnam’s state-run PetroVietnam declined to comment on the concession, which was first granted to India in 2006 but had been due to expire in mid-June. Conflicting territorial claims over the sea stretch back many decades but have intensified in recent years as China and its rivals have reinforced their positions on the rocks and reefs they hold. Far to the south of block 128, drilling has begun in a block owned jointly by Vietnam’s state oil firm, Spain’s Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates. Deepsea Metro I, operated by Odfjell Drilling Ltd., has been drilling in the region since the middle of last month on behalf of Spain’s Repsol SA, which also has rights to neighboring block 07/03, Odfjell said. Odfjell declined to comment on the specific location of its vessel, but shipping data from Thomson Reuters Eikon showed it was in oil block 136/3, which also overlaps China’s claims. Odfjell’s Eirik Knudsen, V‎ice President for Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, referred further queries to Repsol, which declined to comment. PetroVietnam made no comment. When asked about the activity, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposes anyone “carrying out unilateral, illegal oil and gas activities in waters China has jurisdiction over”. “We hope the relevant country can act on the basis of maintaining regional peace and stability and not do anything to complicate the situation,” he told a briefing in Beijing. Chinese General Fan Changlong cut short a visit to Vietnam and a friendship meeting at the China-Vietnam border was canceled around the time the drilling began. The centuries-old mistrust between China and Vietnam is nowhere more evident than in their competing maritime claims, despite their shared communist ideology and growing trade. Asked about the most recent drilling, Vietnamese officials said their Chinese counterparts have started raising concerns about cooperation with both Repsol and ExxonMobil Corp. of the United States, which is developing the $10 billion “Blue Whale” gas concession off central Vietnam. They said Chinese officials also expressed concern at Vietnam’s evolving security relationships with the United States and Japan, both of which have offered moral support for its South China Sea claims and help for Vietnam’s coastguard. Tensions with China were being contained, however, and had not yet reached crisis proportions, they said. “We know they are unhappy again, but we are resisting the pressure – it is a traditional part of our relations with Beijing,” one official said privately. “Other parts of the relationship remain strong.” Underlining the relationship between India and Vietnam, Vietnamese deputy prime minister Pham Binh Minh told a forum in New Delhi this week that India was welcome to play a bigger role in Southeast Asia - and specifically the South China Sea. Hanoi’s growing defense and commercial ties with India are part of its strategy of seeking many partnerships with big powers while avoiding formal military alliances. The pace has picked up since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration took office in 2014 and sought to push back against China’s expanding presence in South Asia by raising its diplomatic and military engagement in Southeast Asia. India is providing naval patrol boats, satellite cover to monitor Vietnam’s waters and training for its submarines and fighter pilots - more military support than it is giving to any other Southeast Asian country. On the agenda are transfers of naval vessels and missiles under a $500 million defense credit line announced last year. Next week, the navies of India, the United States and Japan will hold their largest joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal. ","

Sam Meredith,07132017,CNBC,07062017,"Just 100 companies have been identified as accountable for more than 70 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report published Monday. The Carbon Majors Report, published in collaboration with the Climate Accountability Institute, found that more than half of industrial emissions worldwide could be sourced to only 25 corporate or state-owned businesses. The report said the scale of historical emissions is large enough to have contributed significantly to climate change since 1988. The same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established. Typically, large-scale greenhouse gas emissions data has been collected by country level. However, the Carbon Majors Report focused on fossil fuel producers in order to emphasize the role firms and their investors could play when attempting to tackle climate change in the future. The highest emitting companies over the last three decades included companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP. All three major oil and gas companies have faced heavy criticism for their respective environmental records in the past and have since embarked upon green investments. ExxonMobil announced in May last year it would start exploring carbon capture and storage, while BP and Shell have increased investment in renewables in recent years. ""If the trend in fossil fuel extraction continues over the next 28 years as it has over the previous 28, then global average temperatures would be on course to rise around 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century,"" the report said. Global average temperatures reaching such a level are likely to have potentially disastrous and irreversible effects on the planet's environment. In 2015's landmark Paris accord, almost all world leaders agreed to make sure global warming would stay ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and ""pursue efforts"" to limit a rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. On June 1, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement and start talks to re-enter or renegotiate a new accord. The report also found that around a fifth of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions were supported by public investors. Therefore, it follows investors could have a significant impact in influencing the actions of board-level decision-making moving forwards, the report added. Meantime, almost 100 companies including Apple, Google and beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev have committed to 100 percent renewable power under the RE100 initiative. The initiative is made up of some of the world's biggest businesses, all of which are committed to renewable energy. ","Just 100 firms attributable for 71% of global emissions, report says"
Connor Lott and Sean O'Reilly,07132017,Fool,07062017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) paid out a whopping $5.6 billion to the Bass family this week in exchange for some land in everyone's favorite basin, the Permian. A full transcript follows the video. Connor Lott: Sean, thanks so much for having me on here today. It's a real pleasure. I'm excited to be here and to be part of this. O'Reilly: Have you ever podcasted before? Lott: I have never podcasted, so this is a first on the bucket list. O'Reilly: You're going to send this to your parents, aren't you? Lott: I definitely am, yeah. O'Reilly: Do you listen to a bunch of podcasts? Lott: I do. Now I listen to all the Motley Fool podcasts. O'Reilly: Of course. Lott: Of course, yeah. I'm a loyal follower along with the dozens. And a couple other business ones, and some of those comedy ones, just for fun. O'Reilly: For sure. On today's show, we're going to be diving into a multibillion-dollar purchase by ExxonMobil of some oil acreage in Texas' Permian Basin. But first, Connor, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, your journey toward becoming a Foolish intern? Lott: I started listening to the Fool when I was serving in the Army. I was out at the 101st Airborne in Fort Campbell, and I wanted to learn more about investing. I didn't have a finance background, and I came upon the podcast, and the soothing voice of Chris Hill telling me about the ups and downs of the market every single day was -- O'Reilly: Was it a surreal moment when you finally saw him in person? Lott: I fanboyed really hard. O'Reilly: ""That's Chris Hill!"" [laughs] O'Reilly: We'll convert you before you leave. Lott: Absolutely. I was getting out of the army, and about a year ago I applied for the internship, and through fate and luck, I managed to land here, and it's been an incredible experience learning and being a part of this amazing company. O'Reilly: Awesome. You're one of two of the interns that the fool.com editorial department has with us for ... are you with us for two months? Lott: About two months, yeah, we'll say that. O'Reilly: Split the difference, yeah. It was endearing to me -- you aren't explicitly assigned to the energy, materials, and industrials bureau, but you were like, ""I really like the Permian Basin."" And I was like, ""Wow, this guy is nerding out over a part of Texas."" [laughs] But the stars aligned a little bit, because recently, ExxonMobil, everybody's favorite giant integrated oil major, spent a whopping $5.6 billion, and they paid this to one of America's richest families to expand their presence in the Permian Basin. Why don't you walk us first through some basic details of the deal, and what happened? Lott: This was a pretty earth-shattering move here by ExxonMobil. Back in January of this year, they announced they were going to be buy this huge, huge tract of land out in New Mexico and part of Texas in the Permian Basin sub-sector known as the Delaware Basin from the Bass family, that's out of Fort Worth, Texas. They believe the Permian is going to double their resources to over 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, basically, through acquiring these pieces of land and companies that the Bass family previously owned. Really, this entire area, the Permian has been a hot spot -- O'Reilly: It's the one still profitable area. Lott: It really is. It's like the Energizer Bunny. It keeps going. It's the most resilient play in the oil market right now in the continental United States, and it has been for years. O'Reilly: For sure. On this show, obviously, we've been talking about the Permian, with me and Taylor Muckerman and Tyler Crowe, for, unfortunately, years now. Well, fortunately. It was interesting to me, because for a long time, Exxon hasn't done the shale thing. They really haven't. Lott: Somehow they and Chevron have really stayed away from shale, which was kind of surprising to a lot of industry analysts, because this has been a huge growth area, especially for the past decade. It's done nothing but grow. O'Reilly: You would think those two companies would have literally an army of geologists and scientists being like, ""How do we stay at the forefront of getting oil out of the ground?"" You would have thought they would be in on this. Lott: And I'm sure they do, and I'm sure there's a lot of smart people at both Exxon and Chevron that have rang the cowbell saying, ""We need to get into the Permian."" And they've had a presence in the Permian for this entire time, but nothing to the extent of some of these smaller, more agile companies that have come in and really made a killing in there. It seems like the general corporate strategy for Exxon for the past decade or so has been, ""Let's look abroad, let's look into countries like Russia or Iraq or off the coast of Africa,"" where there are incredible reserves out there. O'Reilly: You hit the nail on the head. When you're as big as Exxon, which, their market cap is bigger than the GDP of most countries, you need to find something big to move the needle. This is the Warren Buffett-Berkshire Hathaway problem, too. It's like, ""What am I going to do that's going to make us tens of billions of dollars?"" So where has Exxon been making most of their money for the last 10 years? Lott: Like I said, they've been making most of their money with offshore drills, off of Africa and parts of Asia. They've been focusing also on expanding into the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic. Their tendrils have gone out all over the world, but they seemingly missed over Texas, which is ironic. I think with a company, like you said, as large as ExxonMobil, it's really steering the ship of state, and for eight to 10 years now, that ship has been concentrating on places like Russia and the Middle East and huge reserves that are still out there. And all of a sudden, now, the new CEO, Darren Woods, is steering that ship back toward Texas and what's available here in the United States. O'Reilly: Right. So, obviously, over that time period, they've been doing pretty well with the refining and the more advanced stuff, so that's good. Why does everybody love the Permian? This is the eternal question. Lott: Like you said, it's an incredibly resilient area for U.S. shale. Really, it's so cheap to produce there, and to drill out there. In terms of upstream production, you're looking at right around break even cost $30 a barrel, which even compared to the Bakken oil field up in North Dakota, that's hovering right around $38. So it's dirt cheap to produce there. O'Reilly: Not only that, but it's closer to Houston, where all the refineries are. You have pipelines. The stars have aligned for all of this. And that, it's light-years ahead of, everybody's been backing out of, I'm sure you've been listening to our recent shows, we've been talking about oil sands in Canada and all that stuff -- they need $70-$80 to start talking about profitability. Lott: Much more expensive, yeah. O'Reilly: What surprised you the most about this deal? Lott: I think what surprised me the most was we think of Exxon as this monolithic, huge company. And they've come in and obviously made a huge acquisition. But what they're doing now is contracting the drilling and the operations within this enormous tract of land that they now own, out to one of the companies they bought back in 2010, called XTO Energy Inc. XTO is lighter footprint. Management is basically giving as much leash as possible to go out there and really make rain for the corporation. Which I think has surprised a lot of analysts, and surprised the oil and gas industry, because you expect Exxon to come in and try to bureaucratically control everything. But again, I think they've realized over the past decades of producing that, ""Let's let XTO, who are very good at what they do, go in there and produce for us."" O'Reilly: That seems really smart. You have Exxon, market cap of $340 billion, and it's an admission that, ""Yeah, we probably aren't the best people for this. We have these guys, we bought them, they've been kind of hanging out over on their own."" I assume they're specialists in shale, right? Lott: Yeah. They absolutely are. They're going to be able to compete with companies out there like [Concho Resources] or Pioneer Resources and [Occidental Petroleum], who have been thriving in the Permian and are true masters of the craft. O'Reilly: That's actually been the funniest thing to me. I started doing the energy show essentially right before the crash happened. It was like the Valentine's Day Massacre, the Thanksgiving Day Massacre. OPEC said no more. Thanksgiving of 2014, oil just plummets. But it's been amazing to me, in the funniest thing has been how Pioneer's stock price, it's fallen a little bit, but they've been incredibly resilient, and their cost kept dropping, and it was just amazing to watch. So, bringing it back around. This is, of course, The Motley Fool. We like investing. Good deal, bad deal for Exxon? Lott: I think it's a good deal for Exxon. I don't think you're going to see a huge uptick or downtick in the share price for the company, but it's going to play out for the over the next 10 to 20 years. This is going to be a long-developed thing. The lease, the amount of money they're giving to the Bass family, has been divided up into almost $6 billion of Exxon stock, and a $1 billion cash payout until 2032. So they're going to be paying them yearly. Yeah. So, the Bass family, they're not hurting for money right now. O'Reilly: That is OK. [laughs] Lott: Yeah. I wish I had some connections. But no. They're going to be developing this until at least until 2032. That's the end of the payout to the Bass family, and that's kind of when I think they're geologists and scientists have estimated that maybe the wells start running dry. So this is a long-term play. You're not going to see a lot of volatility for Exxon. But down the road, it's going to continue to be profitable for them. And, again, it's so low-cost. O'Reilly: Yeah. I really do wonder, and this is just speculation, it's kind of known that, like we were talking about earlier, Exxon needs to find these giant reserves. Because the reserves are dropping. And it doesn't help that the price of oil is falling and you can't count something as a reserve if it's uneconomical. So I have to think this is not going to be their last deal. Lott: No, I don't think so. I think, like I said, Darren Woods, the new CEO, he has kind of an America-first policy now. The previous CEO, now our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, he was very internationally minded, which is great, but you run into a lot of complications -- O'Reilly: It's a hassle, quite frankly. Lott: It is. It's a huge hassle. There's diplomatic, there economic complications. So Darren is looking at, what can we best harvest from the United States? Yes, the price of oil is going to remain low for the foreseeable future more than likely. But we can continue to be profitable, and we can keep our costs low, which is the most important thing, as renewables are on the rise. O'Reilly: I think you cemented ExxonMobil's new strategy, it's the low-stress strategy. [laughs] Lott: Yeah, let's not worry about what's going on in Iraq of all places. Let's worry about-- O'Reilly: If we can make money here, low-stress ... Lott: Keep it in Texas, yeah. O'Reilly: For sure. Listen, man, thank you for your time, all your awesome research. I can't wait to do this again. Lott: Yeah. O'Reilly: And thanks again for becoming an intern. This has been really rewarding. Lott: Sean, thanks so much for having me on, it was a true pleasure, and I look forward to next time. ","

,07202017,Reuters,07132017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Green groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to force Texas to toughen its stance on air pollution by using stricter language in permits it issues to oil refineries and power plants. Five separate lawsuits have asked a federal court in Washington to force EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to respond to petitions by the groups, including the Environmental Integrity Project and the Sierra Club. They want the EPA to intervene in permits issued to several companies by Texas’s environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The groups are claiming each permit is too weak and does not force the companies to do enough to protect air quality. The permits are for Exxon Mobil Corporation’s Baytown Refinery and Baytown Olefins Plant as well as Pasadena Refining System’s Pasadena Refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur Refinery and Southwestern Electric Power Company’s Welsh Power Plant, according to the court filings. The groups say Texas has not held the companies to a high-enough standard for air quality, a standard set not just by the federal Clean Air Act but by the state’s own environmental regulations. The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) on July 6 published a report claiming the state had only 3 percent of companies it found violating its air pollution regulations between 2011 and 2016. Spokespeople for the TCEQ and the EPA both said the agencies would not comment on pending litigation. But Andrew Keese, a spokesman for the TCEQ, referred Reuters to a statement the agency released on July 12 in response to the EIP report calling it “misleading.” “The success of the program is not measured in number of enforcement actions but rather by the state of air quality in Texas,” the statement read. Suits like Thursday’s filings are not based on any new concept. Previous EPA administrators have faced them as well. Gabriel Clark-Leach, a lawyer for the EIP, said the group had filed similar suits in the past and gotten the agency to respond to other requests for intervention in Texas’s state permitting process. He said the groups’ goal in filing the suits was to set a deadline for the EPA to respond to the their petitions. “The only way that we can make them answer our petition is by taking them to court and forcing them to do their job,” he said.

Bob Pisani,07202017,CNBC,07132017,"The state of the markets as earnings season begins: are we really overpriced? Earnings season begins this week in earnest, with reports from Bank of America, IBM and Visa, among others. But there is a growing chorus of voices insisting that the market is topping out. The worries revolve around four main complaints: 1) The bull market is eight years old, few bulls have lasted longer and it is reaching the end of its lifespan, 2) The Fed will have a tougher time than anticipated managing the reduction of its balance sheet and increasing rates, 3) Political developments (lack of progress on tax cuts) are already slowing the advance of the markets and 4) The stock market, particularly technology, is overpriced. Let's just tackle the idea that the market is somehow overpriced. Stocks are at historic highs because earnings are at historic highs and the global economy is improving. It's that simple. But is the market overpriced? The most important determinant of stock prices is forward earnings estimates. According to JP Morgan, the forward price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.5, which is slightly expensive but well within historic norms. The 20-year average is 16. Amen. Of course, there are pockets of the market that are indeed expensive. I'll give you two examples. Apple is trading at 16 times forward 12-month earnings. That's at the high end of where it has been for the past five years. Why? Because every analyst on the street has a buy on the stock and has convinced the world we are in the middle of some kind of supercycle for the upcoming iPhone 8. Maybe, but is it worth the 30 percent gain we have seen this year? That seems stretched to me. Even worse is the situation for Energy stocks, which are way above their historic averages. The forward P/E for the energy group is 26.3, versus 17.4 for the 20-year average, JPMorgan said. ExxonMobil, for example, was supposed to earn 99 cents a share for the second quarter. But that was on April 1 —a lifetime ago. Now that oil isn't rallying, the estimates have come down to 85 cents a share...and they're still going down! Bottom line: there are pockets of the market that are arguably overvalued, but the S&P itself is only modestly stretched. As for the imminent end of the bull market so greatly feared, I will once again give Goldman the final word: ""We don't see the end of bull market as long as the macro backdrop remains supportive with global growth above trend and low recession risk while central banks remain accommodative. And while global equities are at new highs, so are earnings."" The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Even as stocks were steadier Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, some charts still look dicey, and that could be a warning for the broader market. ",Here's why the stock market is not overpriced

For long-term investors, the past eight years have truly been something special. Whereas the stock market has historically increased in value at a rate of 7% annually, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, the average annual return of the S&P 500 since the March 2009 low has been well over double that rate. But it's not just the big gains that investors are relishing. Capital returns have also been way up since 2009. According to data from Bloomberg of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, total capital returns, which includes dividends and stock buybacks, have more than doubled over the past eight years to around a combined $250 billion per quarter. Image source: Getty Images. As should be no surprise, the aggregate value of corporate share buybacks has outpaced the dollar value of corporate dividend payouts in practically every quarter. Common stock repurchases have been a particularly popular tool for publicly listed companies over the past eight years as interest rates have remained near historic lows. This has allowed businesses to borrow cheaply, but it's also made it unattractive to buy interest-bearing assets. The solution? A number of companies with excess cash on their books have turned to share buybacks, allowing them to use their cash to lower their outstanding share count and potentially lift their earnings per share. A lower price-to-earnings ratio could help lift a company's share price by making it look more fundamentally attractive. According to Bloomberg, four companies have combined over the past decade to repurchase a whopping $563 billion worth of their common stock. Let's have a quick look at these stock-repurchase giants and see if their efforts to create value made sense. Image source: Getty Images. When talking about the king of corporate buybacks over the past decade, no company has shelled out more for its own common stock than integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Bloomberg pegs the company's share repurchases at nearly $180 billion in that span. Over that time, ExxonMobil's outstanding share count has reduced from almost 5.6 billion shares to less than 4.2 billion. You might be under the impression that ExxonMobil's share repurchases are meant to appease investors who've struggled with a substantial drop in crude oil prices since 2014, but that's not the case. The company's share repurchases tend to be tied to the price of crude oil. When crude hit triple digits per barrel, ExxonMobil had more than enough extra cash to devote to share repurchases. With crude currently valued at less than $50 a barrel and margins way down, share repurchases have typically been coming in at less than $1 billion a quarter for the past two years. Thus we have a conundrum for the oil giant. Share repurchases make the most sense when it has tons of extra cash flow, but considering that oil company valuations tend to move in step with the price of crude, it means ExxonMobil has a tendency to repurchase the bulk of its stock near its highs. That's not a very efficient use of capital, and it could explain why ExxonMobil has underperformed the S&P 500 by 73 percentage points over the trailing decade. Image source: Apple. Surprise! A company with more than a quarter-trillion dollars in cash on its books (OK, so nearly all of it is overseas) is among the most aggressive when it comes to share repurchases. The chances Apple will continue to be a regular purchaser of its shares seems decent, but we may see a slowdown in the aggressiveness with which Apple rebuys its stock soon enough. Apple's core businesses aren't the issue. The expected launch of the iPhone 8 in the coming months should be huge for the company, and Apple has among the most loyal customers on the planet. The issue is that Apple has utilized debt to fund its share repurchases, and it's now lugging around nearly $99 billion in debt on its balance sheet. Even with almost $53 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, Apple will probably want to address its debt first before going gung-ho on future buybacks. Image source: Microsoft. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also been busy in the buyback department, having repurchased approximately $117 billion worth of its shares over the past 10 years. For the longest time, Microsoft's stock was stuck in a trading range. Yields were low following the Great Recession, which meant little interest in investing its cash hoard, and the company's history of creating value throughout acquisitions has been spotty at best. Purchases of Skype, aQuantive, and Nokia's handset business have all qualified as flops compared with initial expectations.  Thus, repurchasing its shares made sense by boosting EPS and making the already inexpensive software giant appear even cheaper. Since the end of 2007, Microsoft has lowered its share count by a tad over 2 billion shares, or slightly more than 20%. How's that worked out for shareholders? Pretty well, I'd say. Microsoft aggressively rebought its shares throughout the Great Recession, and even during its minor swoon in 2015.  Recently, shares of the company have traded at an all-time high. With the Windows operating system still generating high-margin profits for the company, and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carving out its space, regular share buybacks are icing on the cake for its shareholders. Image source: IBM. Last, but certainly not least, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has racked up an impressive $116 billion worth of share repurchases over the past decade. Considering that IBM has generated between $16.1 billion and $20.7 billion in operating cash flow every year since 2007, it's certainly had the funds to go around. However, IBM's focus on capital returns has less to do with weaker asset yields and more to do with weakness in its legacy businesses. IBM was late to the game in its efforts to focus on cloud computing. While it's been playing catch-up and is seeing substantial cloud growth, its legacy hardware and software businesses still account for the bulk of its revenue. In the company's recently reported second-quarter results, total sales fell by more than 4%, marking the 21st consecutive quarter that Big Blue's year-over-year sales dropped. How's management to keep shareholders happy while the company exacts another multi-year turnaround effort? Simple: Boost capital returns. In addition to a healthy dividend yield of nearly 4%, IBM has pretty steadily repurchased its common stock over the past decade. However, its biggest buys appear to have to come with its stock trading at $175 or higher, meaning IBM's share-repurchase program hasn't had its desired impact, despite reducing its share count by a third over the past decade. While Big Blue remains an intriguing income play, it's clear that the company has a long way to go to right the ship. ","
      
    4 Companies That Have Repurchased the Most Stock Over the Past Decade -- The Motley Fool

  "
Tomi Kilgore,07202017,MarketWatch,07132017,"Published: July 18, 2017 7:16 a.m. ET Companies must report earnings growth to justify lofty stock prices after the major indexes have set repeated records this year By The second-quarter earnings season kicked off in earnest on Friday with the first reports from big banks, and investors should now brace for what will be a key test of sentiment. The stock market is at lofty levels after repeatedly setting records this year, and companies need to show earnings growth to justify the move. Even the Federal Reserve has pointed out that stock valuations are above historical norms, a view that was repeated this week by Chairwoman Janet Yellen in testimony to the House Financial Services panel. The FactSet blended year-over-year per-share earnings growth rate estimate for the S&P 500, which combines results for those companies that have reported (companies with a fiscal quarter that ended in May) with those still to come, stood at 6.3% on Wednesday. That’s below the 13.8% rate recorded for the first quarter, which enjoyed the easiest comparison of any period this year. That’s because the first quarter of 2016 marked the trough of the earnings recession, the long stretch of earnings declines that started in the third quarter of 2015. Analysts expect the second-quarter rate to improve as the earnings season gains pace and revisions move up. But the question for investors, is whether earnings valuations will improve enough to support the S&P 500 index’s

                                   rapid rise this year toward record levels. See also: Earnings recession is over, but it’s not enough to support stock market’s gains “We believe another quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500 in the second quarter is possible, given generally solid overall economic data, the strong rebound in energy sector profits, and solid financial and technology sector earnings gains,” said Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial. “Earnings estimates have been resilient and the ratio of positive to negative pre-announcements is as positive as it has been in three years.” Still, there are headwinds, including the strong dollar, a regular bugbear for companies that generate a lot of revenue overseas, and lower inflation, which gives companies less pricing power. There is also the uncertainty surrounding many of President Donald Trump administration’s promised policy moves, notably on health care and tax reform. Efforts to overhaul or replace the Affordable Care Act remain bogged down with Republicans unable to reach agreement among themselves. Tax reform is not expected until the details of a health care plan are known. White said he’ll try to evaluate just how much a policy boost is baked into analyst expectations this earnings season. He expects it is minimal, and is skeptical of any major initiatives happening in 2017, although tax reform, if it were passed, would be a strong boost for the S&P 500. The energy sector is expected to lead second-quarter gains, mostly because it is recovering from a very low base. In the more than two years that oil futures prices have drifted lower and lower, companies have slashed capex budgets, sold assets and made other moves to get back to growth in a low oil-price environment. The tech sector is expected to be second-strongest, driven by chip makers, which are enjoying strong demand -- and stock price gains -- thanks to the self-driving trend, the popularity of videogaming and the rise of artificial intelligence. But the entire consumer discretionary sector is expected to be a weak spot, given the severe stress in the retail sector as Amazon.com Inc.

The consumer discretionary and utilities S&P 500 subsectors are expected to report declines in earnings. One issue MarketWatch is watching for this earnings season is any comment on a new revenue-recognition accounting rule that will go into effect on January 1, 2018. The rule, named ASC 606, aims to create consistency between how revenue is recognized under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and International Financial Reporting Standards. It is expected to change the timing of the recognition of some revenue and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain customer contracts. It will have an impact on every sector, including banks. Read: Banks are beginning to admit a new rule on revenue recognition will have an impact Some companies have already talked about their preparations for the change, which could have a major impact on revenue. Here are four key sectors to watch this quarter: The energy sector is expected to post earnings growth of 387% for the quarter, and sales growth of 17%, according to FactSet, as it rebounds from the crushing losses of the past two years. But results will be uneven across the various segments of the market with the major integrated oil companies and refiners expected to enjoy the biggest gains and results from oilfield services companies expected to be more subdued. The outlook for the rest of the year is less certain, as oil futures prices have not performed as expected so far. 2017 was supposed to be another year of recovery, and it started with most experts cautiously optimistic about global oil markets on hopes that an improving global economy, more demand and a slowdown in production growth would result in higher prices and diminishing stockpiles. “Some of these elements have played out as expected, some have not,” analysts at Simmons said in a recent note. Global inventories are above a five-year average and higher than what they were at the end of last year, and thus “oil prices and energy stocks have unraveled,” they said. The average daily price of crude oil futures

Oil futures prices remain under pressure, trading under $50 a barrel in recent weeks. Although this week a higher-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and news Saudi Arabia has cut its oil exports have pushed prices higher, crude futures have amassed monthly losses for every month of the year but February.

                                   Netflix kicks off the tech earnings season on Monday with its report, with all but Apple, due Aug. 1, lined up for the next week. Facebook and Alphabet both face their second quarters reporting with a focus on GAAP metrics, which Goldman Sachs points out will have an effect on their gross margins, as well as the margins of tech as a whole. The second calendar quarter is historically Apple’s weakest, and the world’s most valuable company has admitted that consumers seem to be avoiding purchases of its biggest money maker, the iPhone, as they await a new version expected to launch late this quarter, as long as Apple can get past rumored issues with production. With Amazon, the focus will be on its big play for Whole Foods Market Inc.

                                   especially since its recent Prime Day promotion won’t factor in to the quarter being reported. Those large tech companies may determine the eventual outcome of tech’s earnings season due to their large weights in indexes and prominence for investors and the general public, but the sector will also be swayed by less-known companies. Semiconductors will be especially important this quarter, as chip companies sell their wares to the larger players to power gadgets being produced for the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. The push for artificial intelligence has made Nvidia Corp.

                                   showed off its own new server offerings just this week in an attempt to beat back the competition. Investors will be looking for early returns on these new products, and hoping to hear more on the potential for future gains. The reports scheduled for the next few weeks will be important in determining which investor was right: The one that has bet long on these companies producing the technology that will produce huge financial returns for years to come, or the ones who took their profits and walked away last month. The record highs for Wall Street indexes rest on the outcome. The financial sector is expected to show earnings-per-share growth of 5.5% over a year ago, according to FactSet, which currently puts it in third place among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, behind energy and information technology. But the EPS growth estimate fell sharply during the quarter, from a consensus of 8.6% growth as of March 31. Investors should keep in mind that the year-over-year growth in EPS can be somewhat misleading. Banks have been aggressively buying back their own shares, because of “limited opportunities to allocate capital to value generating investments,” analyst Saul Martinez at UBS wrote in a recent note to clients.. “In fact, a substantial portion of EPS growth is currently driven by share buybacks, not earnings growth.” Of the banks reporting on Friday, EPS grew 22% for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

                                   EPS rose 1% while shares outstanding decreased 1.3%. “Ultimately, though, we question whether good EPS growth can be sustained once capital is optimized and rates normalize,” Martinez said. Bank investors had good reason to cheer the results of the most recent Federal Reserve stress tests, but analysts are less upbeat about earnings. “We see more misses than beats,” wrote Jefferies analysts in a July 5 note. J.P. Morgan analysts agreed, writing last week “We expect moderate 2Q earnings.” Chris Whalen, a longtime bank analyst, expects earnings to come in soft enough that the stocks will trade off. “There’s no real growth on the top line,” he told MarketWatch. After several lean years, banks have run out of expenses to cut to boost the bottom line. And most investors are finally starting to acknowledge that the hoped-for “reflation trade” isn’t coming, Whalen said. “The Trump Bump is dead.” On Friday, J.P. Morgan beat earnings estimates, but its stock fell as investors digested the numbers, which included a one-time legal benefit that boosted EPS. Trading revenue declined 14%, mostly due to a 19% drop in fixed-income trading. Citigroup also reported weak trading results, as did Wells Fargo, although it is less of a focus for the San Francisco lender. All three banks reported a slump in mortgage revenues. Next up are Bank of America Corp.

See now:  Mortgage lending takes a bite out of bank earnings despite brisk spring buying season Read now:  Bank earnings: Expect a weak quarter as hopes for a “Trump Bump” fizzle Retail is expected to be by far the weakest sector this earnings season. FactSet is expecting the consumer discretionary sector to show a decline of 2.2% in earnings, but a rise of 3.9% in sales. Retail has moved into the troubled position occupied by the oil and gas industries last year, with distressed companies dotting the sector, bankruptcies pushing up the U.S. retail loan default rate and retailers and brands struggling to generate sales while feeling the “Amazon effect.” But where the energy sector was reacting to the oil price, retail’s problem is a secular shift that will change the retail landscape.

Ten major retailers have filed for bankruptcy, more than all of last year.

,07272017,Reuters,07202017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Green groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to force Texas to toughen its stance on air pollution by using stricter language in permits it issues to oil refineries and power plants. Five separate lawsuits have asked a federal court in Washington to force EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to respond to petitions by the groups, including the Environmental Integrity Project and the Sierra Club. They want the EPA to intervene in permits issued to several companies by Texas’s environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The groups are claiming each permit is too weak and does not force the companies to do enough to protect air quality. The permits are for Exxon Mobil Corporation’s Baytown Refinery and Baytown Olefins Plant as well as Pasadena Refining System’s Pasadena Refinery, Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur Refinery and Southwestern Electric Power Company’s Welsh Power Plant, according to the court filings. The groups say Texas has not held the companies to a high-enough standard for air quality, a standard set not just by the federal Clean Air Act but by the state’s own environmental regulations. The Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) on July 6 published a report claiming the state had only 3 percent of companies it found violating its air pollution regulations between 2011 and 2016. Spokespeople for the TCEQ and the EPA both said the agencies would not comment on pending litigation. But Andrew Keese, a spokesman for the TCEQ, referred Reuters to a statement the agency released on July 12 in response to the EIP report calling it “misleading.” “The success of the program is not measured in number of enforcement actions but rather by the state of air quality in Texas,” the statement read. Suits like Thursday’s filings are not based on any new concept. Previous EPA administrators have faced them as well. Gabriel Clark-Leach, a lawyer for the EIP, said the group had filed similar suits in the past and gotten the agency to respond to other requests for intervention in Texas’s state permitting process. He said the groups’ goal in filing the suits was to set a deadline for the EPA to respond to the their petitions. “The only way that we can make them answer our petition is by taking them to court and forcing them to do their job,” he said.

Mark Kolakowski,07272017,Investopedia,07202017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The weakening U.S. dollar is good news for U.S. corporations with significant sales abroad, promising to bolster their earnings growth and share prices. The biggest winners are likely to be: fast-food franchisor McDonald's Corp. (MCD), which gets 67% of its sales from abroad as well as semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), 87%, semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), 78%, oil giant Exxon-Mobil Corp. (XOM), 67%, and consumer products maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL), 71%. Nonetheless, these stocks are not outliers. For the S&P 500 Index (SPX) as a whole, foreign sales represent 43% of their total revenues, per data from S&P cited by CNBC. Source: CNBC, with data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and S&P Global Market Intelligence Aggregate earnings for companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) could increase by 0.5% for every 1% decline in the value of the dollar, according to analysis by Morgan Stanley (MS), as reported by CNBC. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley says that the dollar can fall by an additional 5% through the end of 2017, for a total decline of 13% for the year, CNBC adds. If so, this would mean a 6.5% boost for S&P 500 profits in 2018, per Morgan Stanley's analysis. Strategas Research Partners, meanwhile, estimates that the falling dollar could increase annual EPS for the S&P 500 by $2 to $3 in 2017 and 2018, CNBC says. The current S&P 500 EPS forecasts from Strategas are $124 for 2017 and $135 for 2018. This translates into a more modest EPS increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. Whatever the exact impact, an earnings boost from the foreign exchange markets will be a welcome development for investors. The dollar has declined by 10.7% against the euro for the year-to-date through Monday, according to Bloomberg Markets data, an even bigger decline than the 8.1% fall in the more broadly-based U.S. Dollar Index, which values the dollar versus a basket of six foreign currencies. Among the U.S.-based companies with large percentages of their total sales coming from the European market alone are: beverage distributor Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (CCE), 100%; online travel booking service The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN), 76%; tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. (PM), 42%; automotive powertrain supplier Borg-Warner Inc. (BWA), 40%; Molson Coors Brewing Co.

Bob Pisani,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Earnings are humming along, with gains of more than 10 percent now expected for the S&P 500 in the second quarter. There's one potential fly in the ointment: Big Oil. ExxonMobil, Chevron and other Big Oil names will begin reporting on Friday. Something unusual is happening: because oil never rallied in the second quarter as anticipated, analysts have been continuing to take down estimates for oil company earnings, and also continue to lower them for the third and fourth quarter. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but Big Oil is expected to be an unusually large part of the earnings gain we are expecting for the index in the second quarter. In fact, the earnings gains are very lopsided, concentrated in three sectors: Q2 earnings: who's contributing the gains Energy 27% Technology 25% Financials 23% The rest: 25% Source: Thomson Reuters Those numbers for energy have been dropping like a rock for months: Energy was expected to contribute about 40 percent of the expected gains for Q2 just a short while ago. That means there is more pressure on the other sectors to take up the slack. How did this happen? It happened because no one — not analysts, not strategists, not astrologers — can get the price of oil right. They can't even get the direction of oil right. I'm not kidding. In January, when oil was well over $50, analysts confidently predicted it would average around $56 by July, according to FactSet. Wrong! Not only did it not go up toward their target price, it promptly went straight down, bottoming around $42 in June. How come everyone has been so wrong? Because global oil producers are big cheaters, including Libya and Nigeria. And then Russia did essentially nothing to help cut production. Regardless: it's been bad news for oil stocks, which are closely correlated to the price of oil and, depending on the company, to natural gas as well (which also dropped). Beginning in April, analysts started scrambling to reduce earnings estimates for Big Oil. Here's what the estimate looked like for ExxonMobil: Exxon: Q2 earnings est.April 1: $0.99 July 1: $0.89 Today: $0.84 Source: Factset That's a 15 percent drop in expectations, a steep decline for such a big company. And analysts kept dropping their estimates in July, even after the quarter ended, which tells you that they are pretty clueless about the implications of such a big drop in oil on earnings and capital spending. And they're doing it for the third quarter estimates as well: they started at $1.07 on April 1, and are now down to $0.85, a 22 percent drop. It's even worse with Chevron, where estimates have come down nearly 25 percent: Chevron April 1 $1.13 July 1: $0.97 Today: $0.86 And you can see what this is doing to their stocks: with the S&P 500 up 10 percent this year, Exxon and Chevron are both DOWN 10 percent for the year. All in all, 25 of the 34 energy companies in the S&P 500 have seen mean EPS estimates come down in the month of July, according to FactSet. Aside from the price of oil, there's a broader problem for Big Oil: production growth is flat to declining for many of the big names, including ExxonMobil. For a multinational company like ExxonMobil, it's getting harder and harder to replace the oil that is pumped out of the ground with new oil. Paul Sankey, a well-respected oil analyst at Wolfe Research and a regular guest on CNBC, downgraded ExxonMobil last week, saying ""Based on historical volume performance, XOM is at risk of shrinking on a sustained basis."" One specific problem for Exxon, Sankey points out, is that it has lost a big driver of production growth: Russia. A huge joint venture with Russian oil giant Rosneft never panned out because Vladimir Putin invaded the Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions made it impossible for Exxon to move forward with development plans. Still, there are some bright spots. ExxonMobil has its massive chemical operations (about 30 percent of revenue) which have done well. Refining operations should also be strong. But Big Oil's biggest asset — and the reason it has kept the interest of a good part of Wall Street for the past couple years — is high dividends, funded by debt.. ExxonMobil pays a 3.8 percent dividend yield, Chevron 4.1 percent, far in excess of the S&P's 1.9 percent yield. Those dividends still are safe, but judging by the reaction this year it's clear that the stock is not going to move anymore on a dividend boost. It's going to move on a commodity boost. So what will ExxonMobil and Chevron say? The key issues will be production and capital spending. With oil below $50, the main hope is discipline on spending. We see this already in the smaller companies that have reported. Hess, Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhilips all said they would reduce capital expenditure plans for the year. Besides spending discipline, the hope for the bulls rests on the weight of history. First, both Exxon and Chevron have only fallen short of the consensus estimate three times in the last three years, and with estimates cut so drastically the bet now is they will hit the EPS target. Production and capital expenditures may be a different story. But the biggest help may be the lack of enthusiasm for the entire energy sector. Lindsey Bell, Investment Strategist for CRFA Research, summed up the state of the entire analyst community in a note to clients yesterday: ""[We] remain on the sidelines because we think earnings will be unimpressive, especially regarding guidance, despite numerous top line beats."" Of 18 analysts tracked by FactSet, only 5 have a Buy, 7 have a Hold, and 6 have a Sell. Given the ""Buy"" bias on Wall Street, that unenthusiastic endorsement that may end up being Big Oil's biggest asset. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Big U.S. pension funds and private money managers are asking gun makers, dealers, retailers and others involved in the firearm industry to engage with them on a set of principles they have developed to promote gun safety. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the pace and push of using technology in the financial sector should serve to improve the lives of the world's most marginalized people. Even as stocks were steadier Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, some charts still look dicey, and that could be a warning for the broader market.

Bill George,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"In his last earnings call as CEO, Jeff Immelt announced yet another disappointing quarter for General Electric. The pressure now mounts on Immelt's successor, John Flannery, to put the company back on track. GE's market capitalization tumbled $170 billion during Immelt's tenure. This year alone, GE stock is down some 18 percent, while the S&P index is up almost 10 percent. GE did not become the most iconic American company through financial engineering or margin analysis. While Flannery can create near-term value by focusing GE's business, he must look beyond immediate financial returns to build an enduring enterprise. Otherwise, GE risks becoming a holding company that buys and sells businesses opportunistically with no dominant strengths. If Flannery's mission for GE is simply a set of financial metrics, he will put the company on the opposite side of great, enduring companies like PepsiCo, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Mayo Clinic, and Merck. For GE to lead American industry for the next century, Flannery needs to determine an over-arching corporate strategy that leverages GE's global strengths to create sustainable competitive advantage. Then he needs to determine how to translate those strengths into leading market positions for each of its businesses through innovation and operational excellence. That's the only way GE can achieve superior long-term financial results. For decades GE has set the standard for the business community through the direction of the company. When Jack Welch took over leadership in 1981, he immediately undid the work of his predecessor, Reginald Jones, declaring that all GE businesses had to be No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective industries or risk being sold off. Welch quickly disposed of Utah International, Jones's largest acquisition. Then he streamlined the organization, taking out multiple layers of line and staff managers. Welch proceeded to build the most successful conglomerate of the 20th Century, with high-performing industrial businesses ranging from appliances to jet engines, balanced by high growth, high return financial businesses in GE Capital. Perhaps only a remarkable leader like Welch, with his incredible mastery of the details of every GE business, could run such a complex enterprise. Welch drove the businesses not only with a clear eye on near-term performance but through focused corporate initiatives like Six Sigma and  Session C that built management and leadership capabilities deep into the GE organization. Part of Welch's legacy is seen in the successful careers of GE alumni such as Dave Cote (Honeywell), Kevin Sharer (Amgen), Jim McNerny (Boeing), and Omar Ishrak (Medtronic). By the end of Welch's 20-year tenure, GE Capital accounted for 52 percent of GE's earnings. Security analysts loved GE's consistently strong results and earnings flexibility, but also began referring derisively to GE as ""a bank."" As Welch's successor, Jeff Immelt knew he needed to lessen GE's dependence on its financial arm and return it to its manufacturing roots, but he was reluctant to undo Welch's legacy. Immelt's hesitancy led to the liquidity crisis GE faced in 2008, triggered by the banking collapse. Immelt had to ask President George Bush to bail out what was once the world's most valuable company. Bush stepped up with a  $139 billion lifeline, putting GE into the same category as AIG, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup – not a club in which GE intended to be. Immelt may have moved too slowly, but he largely dismantled ""the house that Jack built,"" selling off most of GE Capital, divesting NBC, and spinning off legacy businesses like appliances, plastics and lighting. In recent years Immelt has remade GE as a high-tech, large systems company, building GE's expertise in energy systems, jet engines, and health systems. Yet it has been anything but a smooth ride, as volatility in oil prices has dragged down GE's energy business. Meanwhile, GE is running well behind industrial competitors like Honeywell, United Technologies, and Danaher. Their revenue growth, earnings, and stock prices have easily outpaced GE because they are committed to their core markets, never vacillating about their high-tech, market-leading businesses. While Immelt's strategy was directionally correct, impatient investors, frustrated after 16 years of lagging results, thought it was too little, too late. The GE board decided it was time for a change and chose Flannery to refocus GE on near-term results and immediate cash flow. Now Flannery must decide what GE's core business is. Is Flannery willing to invest heavily in the high-tech future Immelt envisioned? Or will he continue to dismantle the company, turning GE into a typical industrial company that grows at the rate of the economy and delivers a high proportion of its free cash flow to short-term investors? The answer will determine whether GE can sustain itself through economic crises and still lead American industry for the next 100 years. Flannery may be tempted to take this near-term view advocated by many GE investors, looking at each business purely through a financial lens. But too much surgery could kill the patient. Without a compelling purpose that inspires customers, employees, and shareholders, GE will lose its leadership position in American industry – an enormous loss for America's most iconic global business. ",Here's the dilemma for GE's new CEO—commentary
Patti Domm,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"The Federal Reserve's midweek meeting — coupled with a marquee list of corporate earnings reports — could make the week ahead among the most important of the summer. There are also several key economic reports, with the biggest being second-quarter GDP Friday, now expected at 2.5 percent. The Fed is not expected to take any action at its two-day meeting, but it could provide more details Wednesday as to when it might start to scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet and what it currently thinks about a now fourth month of weaker inflation data. For the stock market, however, it could be the make-or-break week for earnings season, with more than a third of the S&P 500 companies and 13 Dow stocks reporting. FANG names— Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet — are among about 180 S&P companies reporting, as are Exxon Mobil, Caterpillar, United Technologies, McDonald's, and Boeing. Stocks were mostly higher for the week, but the Dow lagged, with a small decline. The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 hit new all-time highs in the past week, but finished Friday slightly below those levels. The earnings season is expected to be strong but not as strong as last quarter's 15 percent growth. So far, 74 percent of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings estimates, and the rate of earnings growth, including those that have reported, is now expected at about 9.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. ""It plays in with other favorable facts,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""With the Fed being perceived as dovish, and the economy expected to do better in the second half of the year, we're still expecting 6 percent earnings growth. It's going to be good but not spectacular earnings."" As markets await the Fed's announcement, investors will also be watching the dollar, which was down about 1.7 percent against the euro in the past week and now down more than 10 percent for the year. Expectations of a more hawkish European Central Bank contrast with market views that the Fed is more dovish than it had been and is less likely to follow through with another interest-rate hike this year. There are only about 40 percent odds of a December rate hike, according to fed funds futures. Fed Chair Janet Yellen helped shift market expectations with her recent comments on inflation, so that will be the topic the market could react to most in the Fed's 2 p.m. statement Wednesday. ""The Fed will basically put more nuance around what they're going to do on the balance-sheet front,"" said Krishna Memani, CIO at OppenheimerFunds. Memani said the Fed could also address the fact that inflation has come in lower. Yellen and other Fed officials had been saying the drop in inflation was transitory, but in her recent remarks before Congress, she expressed some trepidation, which the market took as dovish. If the Fed formalizes more of that concern in its statement, ""the bond market is going to rally and the stock market is going to rally,"" he said. The Fed could just simply state that inflation has declined further, and that would be the equivalent of it upgrading its concerns, said James Caron, fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""The onus right now is on the market data to really show there is a pickup,"" Caron said. ""For the second quarter, we knew mathematically that inflation was going to hit a soft spot from the year-over-year effects, but there was also an expectation that we would pull out of that soft spot in the third quarter and fourth quarter,"" he said. Caron said the Fed could continue to discuss growth as rising moderately and may change the language on employment to reflect the strong jobs report in June. Caron said the Fed could continue to discuss growth as rising moderately and may change the language on employment to reflect the strong jobs report in June. ""If their dual mandate is full employment and price stability, they're getting an 'A' on one and not doing so well on the other,"" he said. Caron also expects the Fed to comment on its balance sheet. The Fed has long been done with its quantitative easing program, but one vestige of the program has been that it replaces the Treasurys and mortgages on its balance sheet as they roll down. It plans to slowly reduce the amount of replacement securities it is buying, thereby chipping away at the size of the balance sheet. ""Do they get a step closer to saying we're on track to reduce the balance sheet? Yes, I think that also gets communicated. That's probably a September event, and they announce it may start in the fourth quarter,"" he said. Focus will also be on Washington in the week ahead, where the Senate is expected to continue working to repeal Obamacare. Expectations are high on Wall Street that Congress will eventually turn to tax reform this year and have something to vote into law early next year. Many believe that Congress will be motivated to pass a tax cut bill by early 2018 to help Republicans keep their House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. ""I still think they're going to do something, and they have lots of time to do it. The more they fail on other things, the more incentive they have to compromise on this,"" Christopher said. The investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia will continue to get attention. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is expected to be interviewed by a congressional committee in a closed-door session on Monday.

Jeff Cox,07272017,CNBC,07202017,"Investors just keep watching the stock market go ever higher, smashing new records on an almost daily basis. This week, they'll have plenty more to watch in terms of market-moving developments. The highlights: The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday for its last gathering of the summer. While you might think Fed-watching is just for policy dorks, it's not. As the U.S. central bank, the Fed, in addition to regulating banks, also sets the interest rates you pay for all kinds of debt. This week's meeting isn't expected to bring news of a rate increase, but the market is still watching closely. There could be some important language tweaks in the statement the Fed issues after its two-day session. The statement also is likely to include details about how the central bank unwinds all that money-printing stimulus it provided to the economy during and after the financial crisis. Here's some good advice from NerdWallet about how both consumers and investors should view Fed news: ""If you currently have credit-card debt, the clock is officially ticking to pay down the balance before the next Fed hike, which is likely later this year,"" said Kimberly Palmer, credit cards expert at NerdWallet, which provides information for investors and consumers. ""Making early payments by redirecting a portion of savings or income toward that debt can save consumers money by reducing interest payments while rates remain stagnant in the short term."" One of the big economic puzzles this year has been the decline in the housing market. Interest rates that are still low and there are plenty of buyers out there but the sector has struggled and contributed to the mediocre first-half growth of the broader economy. Hopes, however, are starting to rise. Mortgage applications, housing starts and permits all rose in June, providing some glimmer that real estate might be on the rebound. Investors this week will get housing data almost every day to put that theory to the test. Monday brings existing home sales, Tuesday is the closely watched Case-Shiller home price index, Wednesday is new home sales and Thursday will provide numbers on vacancies. Watch the Case-Shiller numbers especially to see if the buyers' market is still propelling prices higher. Speaking of the economy, Friday brings maybe the biggest data point of the week. That's when the government will release its first estimate for second-quarter growth. Economists expect GDP to have bounced 2.5 percent after a pretty dismal 1.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of the year. Even that number isn't terrific, but it could signal that the economy is getting out of its 2 percent doldrums. The Trump administration no doubt will be watching the second quarter GDP report closely. It's a really big week for company earnings as well. Investors watch the reports not only for learning what happened in the last quarter but how corporate executives view prospects for the rest of the year. So far, the news has been pretty good. Of the 19 percent of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, a glittering 73 percent have beaten analyst estimates on profits, and 77 percent have topped on sales, according to FactSet. Those are good numbers to tee up another week of earnings season. The highlights: The Fed isn't the only game in town this week in Washington. Some of the highlights on the political landscape include the likelihood that the Senate will vote, in a mostly ceremonial measure, on whether to proceed on the all-but-dead health-care bill, while the upper house also will take up the nomination of Randal Quarles to the Federal Reserve board on Thursday. If confirmed, Quarles will be the overseer for the nation's bank system. President Donald Trump will be in Youngstown, Ohio on Tuesday evening for a campaign-style rally. Arielle O'Shea, NerdWallet's investing and retirement specialist, offers this advice on what investors should be considering when it comes to the Fed: ""The market is getting pretty good at predicting the Fed's moves, and that's a good thing: It means investors are less likely to see turbulence from each Fed decision, provided the announcements don't throw out any curve balls. Because you're in this for the long game, you're positioned to ride out any market volatility, whether caused by a Fed meeting or another economic event. Instead of reacting to every change in the market, use this time to revisit your investment plan, make sure you're on track, and increase your savings rate if you have the means to do so."" So keep your focus long-term but understand what's happening in the short term. Seems like a great way to approach every investing week.

Sean Williams,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For long-term investors, the past eight years have truly been something special. Whereas the stock market has historically increased in value at a rate of 7% annually, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, the average annual return of the S&P 500 since the March 2009 low has been well over double that rate. But it's not just the big gains that investors are relishing. Capital returns have also been way up since 2009. According to data from Bloomberg of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, total capital returns, which includes dividends and stock buybacks, have more than doubled over the past eight years to around a combined $250 billion per quarter. Image source: Getty Images. As should be no surprise, the aggregate value of corporate share buybacks has outpaced the dollar value of corporate dividend payouts in practically every quarter. Common stock repurchases have been a particularly popular tool for publicly listed companies over the past eight years as interest rates have remained near historic lows. This has allowed businesses to borrow cheaply, but it's also made it unattractive to buy interest-bearing assets. The solution? A number of companies with excess cash on their books have turned to share buybacks, allowing them to use their cash to lower their outstanding share count and potentially lift their earnings per share. A lower price-to-earnings ratio could help lift a company's share price by making it look more fundamentally attractive. According to Bloomberg, four companies have combined over the past decade to repurchase a whopping $563 billion worth of their common stock. Let's have a quick look at these stock-repurchase giants and see if their efforts to create value made sense. Image source: Getty Images. When talking about the king of corporate buybacks over the past decade, no company has shelled out more for its own common stock than integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Bloomberg pegs the company's share repurchases at nearly $180 billion in that span. Over that time, ExxonMobil's outstanding share count has reduced from almost 5.6 billion shares to less than 4.2 billion. You might be under the impression that ExxonMobil's share repurchases are meant to appease investors who've struggled with a substantial drop in crude oil prices since 2014, but that's not the case. The company's share repurchases tend to be tied to the price of crude oil. When crude hit triple digits per barrel, ExxonMobil had more than enough extra cash to devote to share repurchases. With crude currently valued at less than $50 a barrel and margins way down, share repurchases have typically been coming in at less than $1 billion a quarter for the past two years. Thus we have a conundrum for the oil giant. Share repurchases make the most sense when it has tons of extra cash flow, but considering that oil company valuations tend to move in step with the price of crude, it means ExxonMobil has a tendency to repurchase the bulk of its stock near its highs. That's not a very efficient use of capital, and it could explain why ExxonMobil has underperformed the S&P 500 by 73 percentage points over the trailing decade. Image source: Apple. Surprise! A company with more than a quarter-trillion dollars in cash on its books (OK, so nearly all of it is overseas) is among the most aggressive when it comes to share repurchases. The chances Apple will continue to be a regular purchaser of its shares seems decent, but we may see a slowdown in the aggressiveness with which Apple rebuys its stock soon enough. Apple's core businesses aren't the issue. The expected launch of the iPhone 8 in the coming months should be huge for the company, and Apple has among the most loyal customers on the planet. The issue is that Apple has utilized debt to fund its share repurchases, and it's now lugging around nearly $99 billion in debt on its balance sheet. Even with almost $53 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, Apple will probably want to address its debt first before going gung-ho on future buybacks. Image source: Microsoft. Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also been busy in the buyback department, having repurchased approximately $117 billion worth of its shares over the past 10 years. For the longest time, Microsoft's stock was stuck in a trading range. Yields were low following the Great Recession, which meant little interest in investing its cash hoard, and the company's history of creating value throughout acquisitions has been spotty at best. Purchases of Skype, aQuantive, and Nokia's handset business have all qualified as flops compared with initial expectations.  Thus, repurchasing its shares made sense by boosting EPS and making the already inexpensive software giant appear even cheaper. Since the end of 2007, Microsoft has lowered its share count by a tad over 2 billion shares, or slightly more than 20%. How's that worked out for shareholders? Pretty well, I'd say. Microsoft aggressively rebought its shares throughout the Great Recession, and even during its minor swoon in 2015.  Recently, shares of the company have traded at an all-time high. With the Windows operating system still generating high-margin profits for the company, and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carving out its space, regular share buybacks are icing on the cake for its shareholders. Image source: IBM. Last, but certainly not least, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has racked up an impressive $116 billion worth of share repurchases over the past decade. Considering that IBM has generated between $16.1 billion and $20.7 billion in operating cash flow every year since 2007, it's certainly had the funds to go around. However, IBM's focus on capital returns has less to do with weaker asset yields and more to do with weakness in its legacy businesses. IBM was late to the game in its efforts to focus on cloud computing. While it's been playing catch-up and is seeing substantial cloud growth, its legacy hardware and software businesses still account for the bulk of its revenue. In the company's recently reported second-quarter results, total sales fell by more than 4%, marking the 21st consecutive quarter that Big Blue's year-over-year sales dropped. How's management to keep shareholders happy while the company exacts another multi-year turnaround effort? Simple: Boost capital returns. In addition to a healthy dividend yield of nearly 4%, IBM has pretty steadily repurchased its common stock over the past decade. However, its biggest buys appear to have to come with its stock trading at $175 or higher, meaning IBM's share-repurchase program hasn't had its desired impact, despite reducing its share count by a third over the past decade. While Big Blue remains an intriguing income play, it's clear that the company has a long way to go to right the ship. ","
      
    4 Companies That Have Repurchased the Most Stock Over the Past Decade -- The Motley Fool

Travis Hoium,07272017,Fool,07202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Big oil companies are starting to consider what the world will look like after the reign of petroleum is over. For example, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) recently announced it will invest $1 billion per year in clean energy -- a large number, but still a relatively small investment compared to its $25 billion in annual capital spending. Nonetheless, it was a public admission that clean energy is the future, not oil. Rival Total (NYSE:TOT) has, arguably, made the biggest investments in renewable energy, buying two-thirds of solar solutions leader SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), battery company Saft, and stakes in a number of solar power plant projects. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP) have also been in and out of the renewable energy business over the past decade, though both have taken steps back recently. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is really the only holdout among the hydrocarbon majors, continuing to focus solely on fossil fuels. What the rest of them are trying to do is create a path to a world beyond oil. But these old-school energy industry giants have a long road ahead to reach powerhouse status in renewable energy. Image source: Getty Images. Disrupting your own business is hard. When a company is running at full steam and generating cash, and has decades of profitable history to look back on, it's nearly impossible to admit that disruption is coming, even if it's staring you in the face. Microsoft could have produced a viable device to compete with the iPhone, but it was making so much money from Windows and Office that it didn't want to reinvent its business, so it missed out on the smartphone revolution. Sears, JC Penney, Walmart, and nearly every other major retailer are losing sales to Amazon.com, despite the fact that even a decade ago, it was easy to forecast that e-commerce was going to skyrocket. One could tell story after story about steady, profitable, incumbents that were unwilling or unable to make strategic shifts to new business models, despite the fact that they were able to see the changes coming to their industries years in advance. The idea of a company making a firm transition from oil to wind or solar energy seems simple enough. Fellow Fool investor Jason Hall recently asked me if I thought Total would buy out the rest of SunPower soon, as part of its path to the energy business of the future. That decision would seem to make sense for Total, on the surface, but I still view it as unlikely, for now. It's difficult to make a wholesale shift to a new business model, and Total is a perfect example of that. Sources have told me that when it bought its majority stake in SunPower, it asked the company for a 10-year plan -- something that's standard in the fossil fuel industry, where businesses chart their investments many years in advance. But SunPower had never crafted such a plan, because if they did, it would be obsolete in a matter of months. The solar industry changes so quickly that companies must constantly adjust on the fly. According to GTM Research, in 2007, the solar industry installed 2.5 GW of generating capacity worldwide. In 2017, China alone installs about that much every two weeks! No one could have predicted that a decade ago, let alone devised a plan then that still made sense in the current environment. It would be almost impossible for SunPower to be as nimble as it needs to be now under Total's corporate umbrella. The better strategy for Total would be to keep its major stake, support the company financially if that's needed, and maybe swoop in to buy the company outright in five or 10 years when the solar industry is mature and the oil business is dying. Just because oil companies don't have the corporate structure, dexterity, or know-how to run renewable energy companies today doesn't mean they'll all go down in flames with the decline of oil. Once the world definitively moves past peak oil consumption and energy companies see darker days ahead, they'll feel compelled to adjust their strategies. That's when their acquisitions of solar manufacturers and developers will likely begin in earnest. But buying into the still-evolving industry that renewable energy is today is too risky, even for big oil's balance sheets. There's a reason incumbent industries in general have a hard time adapting to upstarts that disrupt their businesses, even if they see the disruption coming. It's hard to turn away from a profitable model and leap to a new growth opportunity, even if it's one with a bright future like solar or energy storage. So, while it seems like the big oil companies are starting to take renewable energy seriously, a decade from now, they probably won't be the big energy players they are today. They're just not built to thrive in the fast-moving renewable energy industry. ","

Wallace Witkowski,07272017,MarketWatch,07202017,"Published: July 21, 2017 5:09 a.m. ET Plastics market expected to grow to $654 billion by 2020 By One of the most awesome monuments of the ancient world still around today is the Great Pyramid of Giza, but one study shows that the modern world is unwittingly producing a lasting plastic monument that could rival nearly 2,000 of those in less than two generations. At current rates, about 12 billion metric tons of plastics will make it into the world’s landfills by 2050, and that’s not counting those that will be recycled or incinerated, according to a recent study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Great Pyramid of Giza weighs about 6.5 million tons, so the amount of waste plastic expected to be put into landfills by 2050 would weigh as much as 1,846 Great Giza pyramids. Given that the stone in the Giza pyramid is about three times more dense than most plastics, those plastic pyramids would be much more massive in size. Plastic expected to make it into landfills by 2050 alone dwarfs the amount of plastic ever produced since the 1950s, when large-scale production of plastics began, the study noted. Since the 1950s, about 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced, with about 6.3 billion tons of that being discarded. Of that discarded plastic, only 9% has been recycled, 12% incinerated, and the remaining 79% going to landfills. The explosion in plastic production has happened only recently, however. Of the 7.8 billion tons of resins and fibers that go into making plastic produced since the 1950s, half, or 3.9 billion tons, has been produced just in the past 13 years, the study said. Much of that rise has been driven by the packaging market. And the global shift from reusable to single-use containers has resulted in a jump in throwaway plastic. “As a result, the share of plastics in municipal solid waste (by mass) increased from less than 1% in 1960 to more than 10% by 2005 in middle- and high-income countries,” the study noted. While the U.S. led the rise in the plastics industry since its inception, China has become a major player, now accounting for 28% of global resin production and 68% of global plastic fiber production, the study noted. The global plastics market is expected to reach $654.38 billion by 2020, driven by packaging, construction and automotive demands in emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, according to San Francisco-based market research firm Grand View Research. Some of the largest U.S. suppliers of plastics and raw materials for plastics include Dow Chemical Co.

,08032017,Reuters,07272017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is considering expanding light crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. If approved, construction could begin on Unit C in 2019 and be completed in 2022, said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. She declined to disclose the contemplated capacity or possible cost of the Unit C expansion. “These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude,” Huffaker said. The expansion would be part of the $20-billion ‘Growing the Gulf’ project announced in March by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods. While Exxon has mentioned potential expansion of light oil refining capacity at the Beaumont plant as part of that project, this is the first time the company has talked about Unit C and given a timeline for possible construction. Since at least 2014, Exxon has been considering the addition of a large distillation unit that would boost Beaumont’s crude oil refining capacity from 362,300 barrels per day (bpd) to between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd, sources told Reuters in 2014 and 2015. The contemplated crude capacity expansion was put on hold in early 2016 due to cuts in capital spending, sources said at the time. On Thursday night, sources familiar with Exxon’s plans said the company was now looking at adding a large crude distillation unit at the refinery. The two crude units currently at the Beaumont refinery are Units A and B. The last major expansion of a U.S. refinery was the 5-year, $10-billion addition of a crude distillation unit and other units at Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur, Texas, refinery which more than doubled its size to 603,000 bpd. The expansion was completed in 2012. The Motiva expansion was originally budgeted at $5 billion, but went through a year-long review in 2009. Last year, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity to Unit A at the Beaumont refinery, Huffaker said. ","

A bill has been passed by an overwhelming vote in both houses that prohibits U.S. firms from partnering with Russian companies on projects in which the latter hold more than a 33% stake. The bill is currently sitting on President Trump's desk. (See also: How Russian Sanctions Impact Western Companies.) Given that Russia is the world's second-largest natural gas producer and a major energy producer, the bill is expected to have a major impact on the business dealings of U.S. energy companies with their Russian counterparts. Here is a brief analysis of two energy companies whose bottom lines may be affected by the sanctions. (See also: How Easily Can Trump Remove Russia Sanctions?) Exxon Mobil has been present in Russia for the past 20 years. Its largest venture in Russia is a partnership with state firm Rosneft (RNFTF) to drill for oil in the Baltic Sea and Siberia, both of which are reported to contain sizeable reserves. The Irving, Texas-based company also owns 30% of the Sakhalin oil fields through the Sakhalin consortium. Rosneft owns 20% of the oil fields, which began production earlier this year. Exxon Mobil was not allowed to collect revenue from the oil fields under the 2014 sanctions put in place by the Obama administration. Then, ExxonMobil estimated that it had potentially lost $1 billion because its joint ventures with Russian firms were ""wound down."" (See also: Exxon Mobil Profit Disappoints Wall Street, Chevron Shines.) Chevron is a relative newcomer to Russia. Even as oil majors made a beeline to Russia after disintegration of the former Soviet Union, Chevron didn't have much presence in the country until the turn of this decade. Its biggest recent investment in the region is in a $36.8 billion plan to boost oil production in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet Republic. Chevron is the largest stakeholder with a 50% share of the project. The other international partners in the project are Exxon Mobil, which holds a 25% stake, and Russian state firm Lukoil (LUKOY), which holds 5%. The composition of that stakeholding ensures that Chevron will not suffer adverse consequences from the sanctions. CNN reported that the language of the new sanctions bill ""ensures that it didn't affect a major pipeline used to transport oil from Kazakhstan through Russia to Ukraine.""

Amazon shares declined 2.5%, having recovered from deeper losses earlier. The pullback in the broader stock market came amid a few blemishes in relatively strong earnings season shows that investors who are skittish about high valuations are taking money off the table while those who are more confident of earnings growth are supporting levels, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager of Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “The fact that the market has recovered most of the losses from early this morning is healthy and we haven’t really seen it fallen much from its peak,” Nolte said. Some analysts suggested that this week’s weakness was due to seasonal positioning. “It is not surprising for market participants to take profits after a big rally, especially going into August, which is historically a difficult month,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Despite this week’s modest losses, the S&P 500 is up 2.1% since the start of the month and up 10.4% year to date. The failure of a Republican-led attempt to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act in the wee hours of Friday morning—viewed as a proxy for President Donald Trump’s ability to deliver on previously pledged pro-growth legislations—may also have dampened investor sentiment, some analysts said. “The reality is that the clock is ticking for this administration to deliver something to their voters,” Krosby said. “Republicans also need to score victories before they hit the campaign trail, but so far, there is no sign of any tax relief that Trump voters have been expecting.” Read: Amazon’s free-spending ways hit earnings, but don’t expect a shift to thrift Some analysts suggested that any pullback in highflying “FAANG” stocks—Facebook Inc.

In a market at record highs with [price-to-earnings] ratios the highest in a decade, that is a tough question to answer,” said James M. Meyer, chief investment officer at TowerBridge Advisors. Economic docket: On the data front, a second-quarter reading on gross domestic product rose 2.6%, below the 2.8% expected by economists polled by MarketWatch. First-quarter GDP growth was revised to 1.2% from 1.4%. The cost of employing the average U.S. worker rose 0.5% in the second quarter but showed little acceleration despite the tightest labor market in years. The final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer-sentiment survey for July was lifted to 93.4 from a preliminary 93.1. That’s a decline, however, from June’s level of 95.1.

Here’s how all 30 Dow stocks contributed to reaching 22,000, through Wednesday: The 12 Dow stocks that have declined erased about 594 points from the Dow. That loss was mostly canceled out by the 13 smallest gainers, meaning the heavy lifting was done by just a handful of stocks. Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.

,08102017,Reuters,08032017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp is considering expanding light crude processing capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery with the addition of a third crude distillation unit, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. If approved, construction could begin on Unit C in 2019 and be completed in 2022, said Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker. She declined to disclose the contemplated capacity or possible cost of the Unit C expansion. “These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude,” Huffaker said. The expansion would be part of the $20-billion ‘Growing the Gulf’ project announced in March by Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Darren Woods. While Exxon has mentioned potential expansion of light oil refining capacity at the Beaumont plant as part of that project, this is the first time the company has talked about Unit C and given a timeline for possible construction. Since at least 2014, Exxon has been considering the addition of a large distillation unit that would boost Beaumont’s crude oil refining capacity from 362,300 barrels per day (bpd) to between 700,000 and 850,000 bpd, sources told Reuters in 2014 and 2015. The contemplated crude capacity expansion was put on hold in early 2016 due to cuts in capital spending, sources said at the time. On Thursday night, sources familiar with Exxon’s plans said the company was now looking at adding a large crude distillation unit at the refinery. The two crude units currently at the Beaumont refinery are Units A and B. The last major expansion of a U.S. refinery was the 5-year, $10-billion addition of a crude distillation unit and other units at Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur, Texas, refinery which more than doubled its size to 603,000 bpd. The expansion was completed in 2012. The Motiva expansion was originally budgeted at $5 billion, but went through a year-long review in 2009. Last year, Exxon added 20,000 bpd in light crude refining capacity to Unit A at the Beaumont refinery, Huffaker said. ","

Thom Tracy,08102017,Investopedia,08032017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The idea of retirement typically appeals more to individuals who have been in the workforce for two or three decades. A 23-year-old college graduate likely has less focus on closing out a career than a 55-year-old wage earner who has planned and saved for 30 years. Despite the stage of life, all individuals should plan for retirement accordingly, positioning their assets with an eye on risk tolerance and time horizons. Every retirement portfolio needs growth components regardless of whether an individual is 65 or 25. The difference manifests in what percentage should be devoted to a security, such as a technology stock. Tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) plow earnings back into research and development (R&D), leading to potential share price appreciation. Investors with a longer time to retirement can afford larger allocations devoted to growth investments. Pre-retirees with a five-year time horizon need to focus on stability but need not eschew equities completely. A large, established company such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) has a solid history of share price stability and a dividend yield of 3.37%, as of Aug. 2, 2016. Stretching for high coupon payments poses risk in the arena of high-yield bonds. Companies issuing such bonds may be in financial distress. Default risk becomes more of a reality with high-yield bonds than the debt of a company whose issues are rated higher. Younger investors with 20 to 30 years until retirement have more time to shake off principal loss resulting from default. A 60-year-old ultra-conservative employee on the edge of retirement may wish to hold a large percentage of U.S. government bonds for income and preservation of capital. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields 2.26% as of Aug. 5, 2017, and is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Hard assets such as residential or commercial real estate are an excellent means to grow capital and generate income, which can be invested for retirement or used to purchase other properties. The daily grind of property management often becomes burdensome for older investors who, as a more leisurely lifestyle approaches, may wish to sell off these assets in favor of municipal bonds or utility stocks. Investing in physical gold bullion or coins has its drawbacks. Storage becomes difficult for larger amounts of the physical asset, but gold is an excellent store of value and more than tripled in price from 1996 through August 2017, when 1 ounce moved from $369 to $1,261. Gold investing appeals to hard asset investors of all ages with a growth investment objective. As the pooled security offered by nearly all 401(k) plans, mutual funds are an easy way for older investors to maintain growth exposure while diversifying assets for a more stable play than individual stocks or bonds. A balanced mutual fund such as the Fidelity Balanced Fund (""FBALX"") holds a medium risk profile with a five-year average annual return of 10.23% through Aug. 5, 2017. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) present a way for young, aggressive investors to reach very specific markets that would otherwise be inaccessible. Investing in the VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF (NYSE ARCA: VNM) is an inexpensive way to gain exposure to emerging markets while time horizons are lengthy. When the 401(k) and individual retirement accounts (IRA) are maxed out, fixed and variable annuities offer a way to continue contributions to a tax-deferred account in which earnings grow unencumbered until withdrawal at retirement. Annuities also have insurance wrappers that guarantee account values to beneficiaries. Fixed annuities are backed by the issuing insurer and often have higher rates than bank certificates of deposit (CD). Regardless of age, all retirement investors need a place to park funds for easy access and risk-free returns. Mutual fund money markets and savings accounts offer maximum safety and liquidity if needed for an emergency, or a spontaneous purchase. Cash equivalents lay a solid foundation on which the balance of riskier retirement investments can be layered. ","Top 10 Investments for Your Retirement Plan (XOM, VNM) | Investopedia"

Fred Imbert,08172017,CNBC,08102017,"Despite this week's minor pullback, stocks still look solid on the surface. But a deeper look inside the market shows signs the bull is starting to crack. Entering Friday's session, 200 S&P 500 components, or 40 percent, were in correction territory. A stock or an asset class enters a correction when it falls at least 10 percent from its 52-week high. Among the stocks in a correction were e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobil, Starbucks and Netflix. Below is a table highlighting the S&P 500 components that are in a correction. The U.S. stock market has already posted strong gains for the year, with the S&P advancing about 10 percent in that time. Leading the charge higher in 2017 has been the tech sector, which is up more than 20 percent year to date. However, there are more signs of an internal breakdown. Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, pointed out in a note Thursday that less than 60 percent of stocks in the Russell 3000 are trading above their 200-day moving average, a key long-term technical metric. ""The Russell 3k represents 98% of U.S. equities. Bulls don't want to see this hold under 60% for too long,"" Krinsky said. ""While not all negative divergences lead to negative outcomes, we are seeing enough of them to warrant some caution as we enter the worst part of the calendar.""

,08242017,Reuters,08172017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two Harvard University researchers said in a study published on Wednesday they had collected data proving that Exxon Mobil Corp made “explicit factual misrepresentations” in newspaper ads it purchased to convey its views on the oil industry and climate science. In an article in the journal Environmental Research Letters, researchers Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes said they examined 187 documents, including internal memos, peer-reviewed papers by Exxon scientists and “advertorials” that ran in The New York Times - paid advertisements in the style of opinion pieces. The researchers said they used a social science analysis method to turn statements in the documents into data points that could be counted and compared to each other. Supran and Oreskes said that as early as 1979, Exxon scientists acknowledged burning fossil fuels was adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and causing global temperatures to rise, but they said the company’s position in newspaper ads remained significantly different by consistently asserting doubt about climate science. The study was funded by the Rockefeller family philanthropies, which previously supported a campaign to prove Exxon knew more than it publicly admitted about climate change. That campaign used the slogan #ExxonKnew. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri called the study “inaccurate and preposterous” and said the researchers’ goal was to attack the company’s reputation at the expense of its shareholders. “Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,” he said. He also noted that Oreskes spearheaded the #ExxonKnew campaign. Oreskes said the Rockefeller family funding did not affect the study’s outcome. She said the impetus for the study came from Exxon’s responses to reports in InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times in September 2015 and October 2015, respectively, that Exxon’s scientists had long known of the dangers fossil fuels posed to the earth’s climate. “They accused the journalists of cherry-picking,” Oreskes said of Exxon’s responses. “They also posted a collection of documents on their website. They said ‘read the documents and make up your own mind.’ We thought that was an excellent opportunity.” Oreskes and Supran pointed to a 2000 Exxon advertorial that said a U.S. government report on climate change put the “political cart before the horse” and was “based on unreliable models.” In his statement on Wednesday, Silvestri offered two examples from advertorials that Exxon had placed in The New York Times, both published in 2000, which he said showed the company did not try to cast doubt on climate change. One statement read: “Enough is known about climate change to recognize it may pose a legitimate long-term risk and that more needs to be learned about it.” ","
                Harvard researchers say Exxon misled public on climate science | Reuters"
Tom DiChristopher,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Exxon Mobil misled the public about climate change for years even as its research echoed the growing scientific consensus that global warming is real and caused by human activity, a new study finds. The conclusion is based on a study by two Harvard University researchers, who used social science methods to compare what Exxon Mobil said in nearly 200 scientific publications and internal communications on climate change with what they presented in three dozen advertisements over 15 years. The researchers' takeaway is that the more publicly available advertisements sowed doubt that climate change is real and caused by humans, while the scientific studies and private exchanges more openly acknowledged that scientific fact. ""We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science — by way of its scientists' academic publications — but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that Exxon Mobil misled the public,"" the researchers wrote. The findings potentially add grist to the mill as a number of attorneys general, including New York's Eric Schneiderman, continue to investigate whether Exxon misled shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also probing how the oil major values its fossil fuel reserves in light of global warming. ""As detailed in our filings in New York court, the Attorney General's investigation of Exxon Mobil has uncovered significant evidence indicating that Exxon may have misled New York investors and consumers about the risk of climate change to the company,"" Amy Spitalnick, press secretary for the New York State Office of the Attorney General told CNBC. ""We will continue to vigorously pursue our investigation, regardless of Exxon's unprecedented campaign of delay and distraction."" The Harvard researchers, Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes, presented their findings in a peer-reviewed article in the journal Environmental Research Letters. In a New York Times op-ed, they said they were inspired to apply empirical analysis to the documents after investigations by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times put forward the notion that Exxon obscured what it long knew about climate change. One key finding is that Exxon acknowledges that climate change is real and human-caused in 83 percent of peer-reviewed papers and 80 percent of internal documents. Yet 81 percent of editorial-style advertisements placed in the New York Times from 1989 to 2004 express doubt. ""In short, Exxon Mobil contributed quietly to climate science and loudly to raising doubts about it,"" Supran and Oreskes said in the op-ed. A March 2000 advertorial by Exxon opens this way: ""Knowing that weather forecasts are reliable for a few days at best, we should recognize the enormous challenge facing scientists seeking to predict climate change and its impact over the next century."" The Harvard report was funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund, which has supported other work to reveal what Exxon knew about climate change and what it publicly disclosed. ""The study was paid for, written and published by activists leading a five-year campaign against the company. It is inaccurate and preposterous,"" Exxon Mobil said in a statement. ""The study claims that Exxon Mobil advertorials in the New York Times cast doubt on climate science, which is the researchers' opinion and not supported by fact,"" the company added, noting its advertisements pointed to potential risks associated with climate change. CNBC contacted about a dozen of Exxon Mobil's largest investors. They either declined to comment or did not respond. Exxon Mobil shareholders recently approved a nonbinding proposal that asked Exxon to disclose the impacts to its business of global climate goals enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to prevent temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Baldwin Brothers, a wealth management firm with $800 million of assets under management, has been lobbying Exxon to disclose risks to its business related to climate change since 2014. Managing Director Dylan Sage said he grew concerned that policies aimed at mitigating global warming would leave much of Exxon's reserves stranded in the ground. ""We wanted to have a better framework to understand under that scenario how much equity of ours is at risk,"" he said. ""Subsequently, we've gotten out of a lot of our Exxon shares when they wouldn't take seriously the risks to their business model around a low-carbon scenario,"" he said.

Tom DiChristopher,08242017,CNBC,08172017,"Chevron Vice Chairman Michael Wirth might be the man to shepherd the oil major into the industry's uncertain future following a report that CEO John Watson will step down. Wirth, who has spent about 35 years at Chevron, is a leading candidate to replace Watson, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Sources told the Journal the decision has not been finalized and could change. The move would put a refining specialist at the helm of the San Ramon, California-headquartered integrated oil company. Wirth holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and spent roughly 10 years as executive vice president of Chevron's downstream and chemicals business — a segment responsible for refining crude oil into gasoline and operating the massive facilities that produce petrochemicals like plastics. Refining operations have been critical to protecting the balance sheets at giant oil and gas companies at a time of persistently low oil and gas prices. Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total have also elevated refining specialists to the top position, the Wall Street Journal notes. In a statement to CNBC, Chevron said, ""We cannot confirm the Journal's reporting. As a practice, we do not comment on rumor or speculation."" Wirth, 56, became vice chairman of the board of directors in February. He also serves as executive vice president for Midstream and Development, a title he has held since last year. In his current role, Wirth is responsible for a broad portfolio that includes Chevron's business transporting fossil fuels and its unit that generates and manages power from gas-fired facilities and renewable sources. He is also in charge of Chevron's trading hubs, which buy and sell crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. According to Chevron's website, Wirth also plays a role in corporate strategy, business development, and policy, government and public affairs. Wirth worked in the refining and chemicals business prior to his current role. Before that, he was president of global supply and trading from 2003 to 2006. Having served in engineering, construction, and operations positions since joining Chevron in 1982, Wirth became president of marketing for Chevron's Asia, Middle East and Africa business in 2001. He also served on the board of directors for Caltex Australia Limited and GS Caltex Corporation, Chevron's main gasoline and diesel brands in the Asia-Pacific region. Wirth has also served on the boards of the San Francisco 49ers Foundation and the Tiger Woods Foundation. ","Meet Michael Wirth, the man who could soon lead Chevron"

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now.

Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

Bradley Olson,08242017,MarketWatch,08172017,"Published: Aug 22, 2017 4:34 p.m. ET Refining specialist Michael Wirth is leading candidate to replace him By Chevron Corp. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down as the energy giant seeks new leadership for a changing oil world, according to people familiar with the matter. The transition is expected to be announced next month, although Watson’s successor hasn’t yet been finalized by the board and could change, the people said.

John Bromels,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

Philip van Doorn,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions. Darren Woods took over the top job at Exxon Mobil Corp.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

                                   which was established in December 2014 and invests in derivatives so that the fund’s value will go up when S&P 500 companies raise their dividends. Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

John Bromels,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","

Sean Williams,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

Philip van Doorn,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.
