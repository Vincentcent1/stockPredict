Since 2014, international oil companies have renounced a total of 19 exploration blocks in Kurdistan, according to an analysis by the Iraq Oil Report. In August, Iraqi state oil firm SOMO blacklisted three tankers involved in shipping crude from Kurdistan, swelling the dispute over oil revenue-sharing between Baghdad and the Kurdistan regional government.

Source: Getty Images. If you could go back to the pre-industrial days of the 18th century, you'd see many things made of wood and stone and metal but nothing made of plastic. Today you can't get away from plastic if you tried. So, if you're thinking about investing in materials, why not invest in one with a history of growth and a stellar outlook? Plastic has conquered the world so thoroughly that it's difficult to actually define the plastic industry, as it has considerable overlap with the chemicals, energy, packaging, and consumer goods sectors. So let's consider only businesses that sell plastic to other businesses and exclude companies that use tons of plastic but are really in the consumer-goods sector. Here's a list of the largest publicly traded plastics manufacturers: Source: Yahoo Finance. The dirty secret behind plastic is that it's derived from fossil fuels. Natural-gas liquids such as ethane, for instance, are ""cracked"" to bring out olefins such as ethylene, which are then polymerized with other stuff to produce the many, almost infinite, varieties of plastic. If you haven't heard, there's been a ""shale revolution"" going on, and the world is awash in natural gas. The results are reverberating throughout the entire plastic production chain. Ethylene is now cheaper to make (cheaper energy costs, cheaper feedstock), and the past few years have seen a significant expansion in the production of both ethylene and polyethylene. Who gains from all this? Basically, the companies with pricing power -- the users of plastic. The less commoditized you are, the better off you'll be. A company like Lego or Hasbro will source plastic at a much better price without having to lower the retail price of its toys. For olefin producers such as LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) and Dow Chemical, it's a different story. A big part of their businesses are commoditized, and they're feeling the pressure to restructure. The Dow/DuPont merger should be seen in this light, as an attempt to carve out the higher margin segments from the rest of the business. LyondellBasell is present along the entire plastic production chain, from the refining of fossil fuels to the ""cracking"" of natural gas liquids and, of course, the actual fabrication of plastics. It's also the largest producer of ethylene in the United States; production of olefins (mainly ethylene and propylene) and polyolefins accounts for about 57% of its revenue. This is a volatile business that's exposed to a variety of prices -- not only crude oil and natural gas, but also ethane, naphtha, and, of course, ethylene and propylene. Revenue was down a whopping 28% last year. It's important to keep in mind, however, that virtually all of the dip was due to a drop in price and that volume was slightly up. The price of ethylene alone fell by 34% in the U.S. and propylene by 45%. But the cost of production also fell, so much so that earnings posted a record high. This kind of thing is not strange for a business like LyondellBasell, and that's why gross profit or EBITDA is a better measure of performance than revenue. LyondellBasell has a good balance sheet, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.9, but it's a recent Chapter 11 ""graduate"", and a watchful eye should be kept on its debt levels. At the moment, it's selling for about 7 times last year's earnings. That's cheap historically, but what makes the company really interesting is that it's a voracious buyer of its own stock. Since the end of 2013, it's reduced about a quarter of its share count. Part of the purchase has been financed with debt, but most of it has come from free cash flow. The risk with an investment like this is collapsing margins -- either a rise in feedstock prices, which can't be passed on to customers, or a fall in olefin and polyolefin prices without a corresponding fall in feedstock. The main feedstock for most U.S.-based ethylene producers is ethane, and there are some murmurings of a spike in ethane prices. It's also true that ethylene capacity will most likely expand over the coming years, all of which points to a worrying compression of margins. But all of this may be priced in, and long-term prospects may be sound, especially with the manageable debt and the extra juice from share buybacks. Going upstream to a company that's more a user of plastic than a producer of it is like taking a breath of fresh air -- the businesses are simpler, less volatile, and just better. AptarGroup (NYSE:ATR) is basically a packaging company. The fine-mist maker on your cologne bottle, pre-filled syringe components, and dispensing closures are some of its main products. Unlike LyondellBasell and its compatriots, AptarGroup is very steady in its earning power. In fact, I couldn't find the last time it's suffered a net loss. Its history is one of steady margins, moderate growth, strong free cash flow, and increasing dividends. It's a prime example of a rather boring business that happens to make good money. Aptar's margins have improved steadily over the past few years, helped by cheaper raw-material prices, and this trend may very well continue over the near future. But Aptar isn't cheap. At current prices, it's valued at about 24 times last year's earnings. Unless you think Aptar is due for some stellar growth, I would recommend you wait for a cheaper price. Of the two businesses we've mentioned -- LyondellBasell and AptarGroup -- the latter is the superior business, the former the superior investment. If I were forced to choose one over the other, my choice would have to be LyondellBasell. Quality of business is important enough to trump price on many an occasion, but in this instance, my feeling is that Aptar's superiority as a business isn't enough to wash away its price tag. And LyondellBasell, despite its near-term troubles, is still in a sound business -- one that's here to stay. After all, what can replace plastic? What else can you shape and mold in such variety, with such ease, and at such a price? ","

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.  ","We're headed at a 'cyber Pearl Harbor,' says Adm James Stavridis"
John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump
Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"With oil and gas becoming top priorities for economic growth in the incoming administration and the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC member countries to cut production, oil and gas prices will rise, Hess CEO John Hess told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly. ""It's clear that the Trump administration puts a high priority on energy, that oil and gas are engines of economic growth going forward,"" Hess said.

Selena Maranjian,12152016,Fool,12082016,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful.

He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching!

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.

John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump
Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"With oil and gas becoming top priorities for economic growth in the incoming administration and the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC member countries to cut production, oil and gas prices will rise, Hess CEO John Hess told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly. ""It's clear that the Trump administration puts a high priority on energy, that oil and gas are engines of economic growth going forward,"" Hess said.

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable? No wonder people like Mitt Romney and Carly Fiorina were willing to swallow their pride and suck up to Future-Appointed-President Trumputin in the hope of a job.

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"The U.S. has a pressing need to bolster its weak cybersecurity in the face of huge breaches like Russia's suspected sabotage of the election system and Yahoo's billion-user hack, Ret. Adm. James Stavridis told CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the greatest mismatch between the level of threat, very high, and the level of preparation, quite low,"" the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander told ""Squawk Box."" ""We're headed toward a cyber Pearl Harbor, and it is going to come at either the grid or the financial sector,"" he said, echoing a term used by then Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2012. The two nations that pose the biggest threats to the United States are Russia and China, Stavridis said, followed by North Korea and Iran. While he sees Russia and China as most dangerous, the United States should be vigilant with regards to all potential actors, he said. Stavridis brought up North Korea's response to the 2014 film ""The Interview,"" a satire about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""They lashed out with a cyberattack against Sony Pictures, an American corporation, did tens of millions of dollars of kinetic damage to Sony as well as a great deal of reputational damage,"" he said. ""So it's not just big nations coming at big nations, it's also small nations going at big nations."" But the big nations could conceivably come to a solution, said Stavridis. He proposed that future administrations create a position titled director of national intelligence and cybersecurity. ""That idea of interagency cooperation is key to protecting us in the cyber realm,"" he said. Stavridis, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, had been rumored as a possible candidate for secretary of State in the Trump administration. He said he was pleased with President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the position, citing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson's business relations abroad and noting the importance of cultivating a ""more transactional relationship"" with Russia.  ","We're headed at a 'cyber Pearl Harbor,' says Adm James Stavridis"
John Harwood,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"Donald Trump liked to say this fall that Hillary Clinton had only ""bad experience"" in government. Soon, Americans will start learning how that compares to virtually none. By tapping Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson for secretary of State, the president-elect has moved to fill the six top jobs in his administration. The team he assembled has less government experience than any in recent presidential history — by far. For the White House, Trump has picked Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as chief of staff and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. To stock his Cabinet, he picked finance executive Steven Mnuchin for the Treasury Department, Ret. Gen. James Mattis for the Pentagon and Tillerson for State. Like Trump, all lack any experience in civilian government service. The only top choices who do are Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was selected for Energy secretary on Wednesday. That's far different from the initial teams selected by any of the last five presidents. Every one of the top six appointees by Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush boasted previous government service. In Bill Clinton's White House, only his first chief of staff, Mack McLarty, an Arkansas energy executive, had not worked in government before; in Ronald Reagan's, only Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, who had run Merrill Lynch, had never worked in government. Moreover, Reagan, Clinton and the younger Bush had all spent years as governors of their states. The elder Bush had served in Congress, run the CIA and been U.S. envoy to China. In some ways, the absence of government experience by Trump and much of his team fits the public mood. On Election Day, two-thirds of voters told exit pollsters they feel either dissatisfied or angry at the federal government. More than experience or judgment, they identified ability to ""bring change"" as the most important quality in the next president. During the campaign, Trump bluntly attacked the competence of recent presidents and their staffs. The billionaire real estate tycoon promised to improve on government's performance after three decades of stagnated middle-class incomes and persistent national security woes. Now Trump's task is making the gears of a complex federal apparatus turn in ways that convert his rhetoric — on issues from cutting government waste to overhauling the tax system to implementing a new strategy against ISIS — into the changes voters want. ""The problem is simply enormous,"" said Donald Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The need to manage public opinion, reach accommodations with Congress and navigate the federal bureaucracy presents challenges unlike those that corporate executives or military commanders have to grapple with. The absence of government experience doesn't mean a Cabinet secretary can't be effective. Kettl cited the strides made by former auto executive Robert McNamara in overhauling management of the Pentagon after President John F. Kennedy made him Defense secretary in the 1960s. But Kettl added that it increases the importance of selecting deputies who know enough to follow through and implement new policy commitments. The issue extends well beyond the top echelons of the new administration. Trump is sending Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development with no experience in housing policy. Restaurant executive Andrew Puzder, his choice for Labor secretary, and philanthropist Betsy DeVos, his would-be Education secretary, haven't served in government. Nor has wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who's headed for the Small Business Administration. ",Running the government with no government experience: Another first for team Trump
Elizabeth Gurdus,12152016,CNBC,12082016,"With oil and gas becoming top priorities for economic growth in the incoming administration and the recent agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC member countries to cut production, oil and gas prices will rise, Hess CEO John Hess told CNBC on Wednesday. ""You clearly have to have a new chapter of rising oil prices to attract investment, to grow supply, to keep up with growing demand,"" Hess told ""Squawk Box."" ""I think we're now in an upward trajectory of prices."" In a capital-intensive business such as the oil and gas industry, attracting investment is key, and the OPEC deal will help because it will end the supply glut that has deflated prices, he said. ""At the end of the day, what's most important for oil and gas supply? The price,"" Hess said. ""We have to have the price signal to make sure we have enough supply to be affordable, that it's going to keep price stability, and it's also going to have supply security."" Hess said that for supply and demand to strike a good balance, oil prices need to trade in a range of $60 to $80. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude were down about 1.5 percent  Wednesday. Hess cheered Trump's tap for secretary of State, Exxon Mobil  chief Rex Tillerson, calling him an ""outstanding business leader"" who is well-qualified and ""knowledgeable about foreign affairs."" Regarding concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hess said the oil executive ""deals with Putin as a government leader as he would any government leader where he has to do business,"" brushing off rumors that the two are friendly. ""It's clear that the Trump administration puts a high priority on energy, that oil and gas are engines of economic growth going forward,"" Hess said.

If you're wondering, ""What is dividend income?"" then here's the short answer: Dividend income is an unexpectedly powerful way to secure a comfortable retirement. Once you read the case for dividends and learn the difference between ordinary and qualified dividends, as well as the tax rates for income from dividends, the next question you'll be asking is ""Which stocks pay dividends?"" Image source: Getty Images. A dividend is a portion of a company's earnings that's paid out to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, though some are paid annually, monthly, or even irregularly. When a company earns a profit, it can do many things with that money. It might pay down debt, buy back shares, build new facilities, hire more workers, buy more advertising, acquire another company, and so on. Paying a dividend is just one of many options. Some companies pay dividends to their shareholders, and some do not. Most often, relatively young and fast-growing companies won't pay dividends, because their best use for excess cash is expanding their business. (That's a way to reward shareholders, too -- making the company more successful and therefore more valuable.) When companies grow larger and have more reliable earnings, then they may choose to pay a dividend. If they fall on hard times, that payout might get reduced or eliminated, but that's generally a last resort. Image source: Getty Images. Dividends are often thought of as investments for retirees -- stable but slow-moving. However, the historical returns of dividend stocks are far from dull. Get this: According to Ned Davis Research, from 1972 through early 2016, dividend stocks averaged an annual gain of 8.8% versus just 2.2% for non-dividend payers. Indeed, from 1930 through 2014, dividends have accounted for about 40% of the 10.3% average annual return of the S&P 500. See? Not so boring after all, are they? Image source: Getty Images. A 3% or 4% dividend yield may not sound that impressive, but if that's the average overall yield you're getting on a $300,000 retirement portfolio, then you're looking at $9,000 to $12,000 in annual income. Dividends can be tax-friendly, too. In the eyes of the IRS, dividend income falls into one of two categories: qualified or non-qualified. Much of investors' dividend income is qualified, which means it's subject to a lower tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at 0% if you're in the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% if your tax bracket is 25% to 35%, and 20% if you're in the top bracket. Non-qualified dividend income is taxed at your marginal income tax rate. Hundreds of stocks pay dividends, and many of them are household names. Here are just a few examples and their recent dividend yields: Stock Recent dividend yield AT&T 5.1% Ford Motor Company 4.8% Verizon Communications 4.6% Altria Group 3.8% Chevron 3.8% Pfizer 3.8% IBM 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.4% Procter & Gamble 3.2% General Electric 3% Intel 3% Image source: Getty Images. Finally, as you search for great dividend-payers for your portfolio, here are some things to keep in mind: Adding dividend payers to your portfolio can help it grow in the years before you retire and can provide valuable dividend income in retirement.

Brett Arends,12152016,MarketWatch,12082016,"Published: Dec 14, 2016 12:34 p.m. ET His billionaire and multimillionaire picks will enrich themselves through a special IRS code By Have you heard about the latest tax shelter for the super-rich? It doesn’t involve investing in underwater condominiums in depressed areas or buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds. It doesn’t involve setting up a subchapter S corporation or buying timberland. It doesn’t involve writing off your yacht as a business expense, or your wife’s thoroughbred horses as a medical cost. And it makes the paltry 401(k) and IRAs used by the peasants look pitiful. The big new tax break? Joining Donald Trump’s Cabinet! Thanks to Internal Revenue Code Section 1043, any business guy or gal who answers the call of “President Trumputin” to Serve the Nation (America or Russia, take your pick) gets a sweetheart deal. He can cash out all his big stock gains and pay zero — read that again: zero — tax. Cha-ching! For new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that is going to mean a big fat savings somewhere between $11 million and $48 million. Other administration officials also cashing in will be billionaires Todd Ricketts, Betsy DeVos and Wilbur Ross, to name a few. Who knew “serving your country” could be so profitable?

Hundreds of millions in capital gains? No problem! Has Trumputin got a deal for you — come on down! Don’t worry, peasants. He’ll cut your taxes by a few bucks next year too. Around the time he also starts cutting your Social Security and Medicare. Let’s not forget the biggest potential winner of them all: Trumputin himself. He claims his business is worth around $10 billion, though even he admits a few billion of that is “brand value” — or, in accounting terms, “hot air.” Forbes, which specializes in these things, puts the figure at $3.7 billion. If they’re right, Trumputin could use his spell in the government to sell his business to his kids and save about $740 million — you read that right — in capital gains taxes. That’s 20% of $3.7 billion. The math isn’t complicated. All he needs is to get a signed “Certificate of Divestiture” ... from the next president. Hmmm. Kind of puts your own estate planning efforts into perspective, doesn’t it? How’s that “Medicaid Trust” look now? Section 1043 began life, like so many bad things in Washington, as a product of good intentions and a Bush presidency. In this case, it was signed into law under Bush 41. The rationale: To make it easier to recruit rich people from the private sector to work in government, and to avoid conflicts of interest. Ordinarily, a wealthy person who wants to cash out of their concentrated holdings and move their money into a diversified portfolio would have to hand over 20% of the capital gains along the way. But under Section 1043, they get to skip that part. Any new “officer or employee of the executive branch” can sell their holdings, and move the money into mutual funds or Treasury bonds, without paying any tax at all. As far as the IRS is concerned, any capital gains are deferred. Technically, there will eventually be tax due when, or if, those mutual funds in turn are sold. But that day might be put off ... indefinitely. When you reflect that there are also plans afoot to abolish the estate tax, you can see why those people are so cheerful. But, yes, by all means, let’s all talk about whether burning the flag should be illegal. Or Kanye West! Let’s talk about Kanye West! The Roman emperors kept the suckers happy with bread and circuses.

In an article written after Henry Paulson, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was appointed Treasury secretary by President George W. Bush in 2006, three tax professors explained how the divestiture of assets to comply the Ethics in Government Act and the deferral of tax on capital gains works. Although a relatively limited number of public officials can take advantage of the rule that allows them to defer the recognition of gain from sales of assets, the tax benefits available to those officials can be considerable, the academics wrote. Appointees forced to sell conflicting assets are required to purchases government securities or diversified mutual funds in an amount equal to sale proceeds. The cost basis for tax purposes of the substitute permitted property is reduced, via another form filed with the IRS, by the unrecognized gain from the sale made under the certificate of divestiture. In other words, any gain or loss is transferred to the new property to be recognized when it is sold. Therefore, any capital-gains tax is only deferred — not forgiven — and must be paid when the Treasury bonds or index funds into which those assets were moved are eventually sold.

Mnuchin is also a board member of the bank, one that is big enough to automatically qualify for supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which coordinates regulation of banks to prevent supervisory gaps and regulatory inconsistencies that occurred prior to the crisis. As Treasury secretary, Mnuchin would serve as chairman of the FSOC. Goldman Sachs is also under the supervision of the FSOC. As the man responsible for decisions about U.S. government bond sales and pricing, Mnuchin would likely not be able to buy Treasury bonds with the proceeds of the sale of his CIT stock or any Goldman Sachs holdings, either. As of Nov. 14, Gary Cohn owns 902,000 shares in Goldman. Those shares will probably have to go, along with any other assets that could conflict with his role as the president-elect’s chief adviser on economic policy. Cohn is currently Goldman Sachs’s president and chief operating officer. Mnuchin worked for Goldman for 17 years and was a member of its management committee until leaving in 2002. Robert Mnuchin, his father, was also partner at Goldman Sachs in charge of equity trading and a member of the management committee. See also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chairman and CEO who was unveiled Tuesday as Trump’s pick to lead the State Department, owns 2,637,000 shares of Exxon (0.06% of the company) as of Dec. 1, according to FactSet. Conflict-of-interest statutes and the federal standards of ethical conduct do not apply to President-elect Trump and Vice President–elect Mike Pence. That’s because the two most senior executive branch executives are not considered employees of the federal government under the terms of the statute that forces the sale of conflicted assets. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 does require high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on periodic financial disclosure forms. Such disclosures are intended to prevent financial conflicts of interest by lending some transparency to the personal finances of senior government officials. Trump has said he will turn over his businesses to his children and had scheduled a press conference for this Thursday to announce his plans to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. That press conference has been moved to January, with a set of tweets having to suffice in the near term: Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! Trump cannot be forced to give up direct control of his business interests or to sell investments that may present a conflict of interest with the official duties of the presidency, whether those conflicts are actual or simply admit the possibility of acting out of self-interest rather than in the country’s interest. President Barack Obama put his investment holdings into index funds. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush placed their assets in “blind trusts,” with all investment decisions during their presidencies in the hands of independent third-party managers.

Mark Fahey,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"President-elect Donald Trump can influence stock prices and change corporate plans simply by tweeting, and few companies are as dependent on the government as the big contractors. About 61 entities earned $1 billion or more from federal contracts in the 2015 fiscal year, and 34 of those are publicly traded companies, according to data from the federal procurement data system. As you would expect, the biggest recipients are defense contractors, which already had good reason to watch Trump closely after he was involved in a deal to keep Carrier jobs in Indiana. Companies like Lockheed Martin may top the list at $36 billion in contractual obligations, but companies across several other industries are getting a huge amount of their revenue from the government, according to data from the federal system and FactSet. For the energy sector, Exxon Mobil is the biggest contractor with almost $800 million in petroleum contracts, mostly for the Defense Logistics Agency. That may seem like a lot, but it's a negligible fraction of the energy giant's revenue each year. The same is true for the telecom leader, AT&T, and shipping leader FedEx, which each made a little over $600 million from the government in 2015. The situation is completely different for the leading firm in information technology, SAIC, which depends on government contracts for 78 percent of its revenue. Private prisons firm GEO Group lead the real estate sector, making about 71 percent of its $1.8 billion in sales from government contracts. In health care, McKesson Corp. made over $8 billion, most of which came from its lucrative relationship with Veteran's Affairs. That's about 4 percent of the pharmaceutical distributor's revenue. For companies classified as financial firms, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest government contractor. But the company didn't earn that position through its financial businesses — most of its government revenue came from its nonfinancial holdings, including providing metals to the U.S. Mint, mobile homes for FEMA and flight training for the FAA, according to government data. Not counting state or local spending, the federal government paid almost $240 billion to its top 100 contractors in 2015. Those are big sums, and those companies are going to be noticing everything Trump says. ",Top government contractors: 52 public companies that make the most
Michael K. Farr,01052017,CNBC,12292016,"Farr, Miller & Washington is a ""buy-to-hold"" investment manager, which means we make each investment with the intent to hold the position for a period of 3-5 years. Nevertheless, in each of the past eleven Decembers I have selected and invested personally in ten of the stocks we follow with the intention of holding for just one year. These are companies that I find especially attractive in light of their valuations or their potential to benefit from economic developments. I hold an equal dollar amount in each of the positions for the following year, and then I reinvest in the new list. The following is my Top 10 for 2017, listed in alphabetical order. This year's Top Ten represent a nice combination of growth and defensiveness. Six of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors are represented, and their average long-term estimated growth rate (in EPS) is well in excess of the overall market. Also on average, these companies are much larger than the average S&P 500 company while carrying an average dividend yield of about 2.0 percent. Results have been good in some years and not as good in others. I will sell my 2016 names on Friday, December 30th and buy the following names that afternoon. These are not recommendations to buy or sell securities. There is risk of losing principal. Past performance is no indication of future results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott Laboratories is a diversified, global healthcare company focused on nutritionals, medical products, established pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics.  Abbott is a unique asset because of its significant emerging-market exposure and the significant ""direct-to-consumer"" revenue that it generates.  Abbott's stock price has recently under-performed the broader market and its healthcare peers due to concerns about nutritional sales in China, the company's exposure to emerging markets in general, and the company's proposed acquisition of St. Jude.  Though emerging markets are currently out-of-favor, we believe that this exposure will prove to be profitable for clients over the long run.  The St. Jude acquisition is expected to be very accretive to 2018 earnings per share (EPS).  And though Abbott will need to substantially increase its debt load in order to fund this transaction, coverage ratios should be reasonable, and St. Jude and Abbott have both run businesses that have held up well during tough economic times.  The aforementioned concerns have left Abbott's stock trading at a discount to the overall market (e.g. 16 times estimated CY17 EPS) while offering investors a 2.7 percent dividend yield.  This multiple looks especially attractive vs. the 20 times plus multiples being awarded to consumer staple stocks, a sector that is also considered defensive in nature by investors. Alphabet (GOOG) Alphabet is a holding company best known for owning Google.  Google generates revenue primarily through selling advertising through Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube, with a growing contribution from sales of apps and content (Google Play), hardware, and cloud services.  The stock has under-performed in 2016 as it consolidated big gains from the second half of 2015.  Despite 16 percent earnings growth this year, the stock is up just 4 percent.  Meanwhile, the company continues to tweak its algorithms, ad loads, and placements to generate more clicks and higher revenues.  The balance sheet is flush with net cash and investments totaling some $85 billion.  Sixty percent of that cash is overseas, so any tax reform that lowers the rate on repatriation would benefit the company and shareholders.  The company does have some regulatory issues in Europe, but it could be years before that gets resolved.  We expect earnings growth in the low-to-mid teens over the next few years as the company benefits from the ongoing movement of advertising dollars from traditional formats to digital, ramps up cloud software and infrastructure services to corporations, and capitalizes on its investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The stock trades at 19.3 times estimated CY17 EPS. Becton Dickinson (BDX) Becton Dickinson is a global supplier of medical devices, hospital supplies, diagnostic equipment, and medication management systems to hospitals and labs.  Consumable products comprise 85 percent of revenue with the other 15 percent coming from equipment.  The company should continue to benefit from the following long-term secular trends:  1) Aging populations spending more on healthcare in developed nations; 2) Rising wealth in emerging economies leading to higher healthcare spending and a greater focus on safety; and 3) Movement in the U.S. health care market away from products and towards ""solutions."" Becton Dickinson has a strong track record of growing sales and earnings faster, and in a more stable fashion, than the overall market.  The company's earnings did not drop during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and we believe that the company's long-term growth algorithm (e.g. 5 percent revenue growth and 10 percent EPS growth) is reasonable and attractive in the current slow-growth environment.  Questions about the future of the Affordable Care Act could weigh on the shares near-term, but the long-term secular trends cited above should ultimately outweigh these near-term concerns.  The risk/reward appears positive with the stock trading at 17.2x estimated CY17 EPS.  The dividend yield is 1.7 percent. CVS (CVS) CVS is comprised of over 9,600 retail pharmacies, more than 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) with over 80 million plan members, a senior pharmacy care business serving over one million patients per year, and an expanding specialty pharmacy business.  CVS drove industry-leading performance by combining its retail pharmacy business with Caremark's PBM.  However, the stock has been weak in recent months as the competition appears to have caught up a bit.  Specifically, the company recently announced that rival PBMs were steering business away from CVS pharmacies.  This caused the company to reduce its expectations for prescriptions filled in 2017, which reduces revenue but hits profits more severely due to the significant fixed costs incurred by running a retail pharmacy.  Longer term, we believe that CVS is well-positioned to take advantage of higher U.S. drug demand (generic, branded and specialty), and its PBM business should continue to play an important role in keeping drug costs from rising too rapidly.  The stock currently trades at 13.5 times estimated CY17 EPS and offers investors a 2.5 percent dividend yield.  The current valuation appears quite attractive for long-term focused investors. ExxonMobil (XOM) ExxonMobil is an integrated oil company.  Its business starts with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and then moves to the production of petroleum products, and finally to the transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.  The stock performance has lagged the broader energy sector, which is not unusual in the early stages of a commodity price recovery.  Oil prices are up 50 percent from the lows of January 2016.  The company has historically generated strong returns on average capital employed through its relatively low finding and development costs.  The reset in commodity prices has forced companies to find ways to live within their cash flow, and ExxonMobil appears well on its way to achieving free cash flow neutrality (cash from operations covers capital expenditures, dividends, and any share repurchases).  ).  Additionally, the company may benefit from policy changes that open more drilling areas or improve relations with Russia.  If the U.S. rolls back sanctions on Russia, the company stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil.  The stock trades at 21.4 times estimated CY17 EPS.  On cash earnings, the stock is trading at 7.6 times our estimates for 2017 EBITDA per share.  The stock also offers a 3.3 percent dividend yield. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is one of the world's largest and most diversified healthcare companies with revenue divided among the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer divisions.  The company should continue to benefit from an aging global population and rising standards of living in the world's emerging economies.  Johnson & Johnson has a long history of growing its businesses organically while simultaneously adding value by adeptly managing its portfolio of over 250 operating companies.  The company enjoys a AAA-rated balance sheet, produces a lot of free cash flow, and generates above-average returns on equity.  Healthcare stocks have been among the worst performers in 2016 due to concerns about intervention in drug pricing and the future of the Affordable Care Act.  These concerns have left Johnson and Johnson trading at 16.2x estimated CY17 EPS, which represents a discount to the broader market averages.  This reasonable multiple, the 2.8 percent dividend yield, and our expectation that JNJ should continue to grow faster, and in a more stable fashion than the overall market over the next five years, underpin our positive view of the stock at current levels. Lowe's (LOW) The home improvement sector has been one of the few attractive areas within retail for the past few years, and we think the strong relative performance can continue for a few more years as residential investment remains depressed compared to long-term historical averages.  LOW's effectively operates in a duopoly with competitor Home Depot, while the remaining industry competitors are too small to achieve the economies of scale that the two industry bellwethers enjoy.  In addition, LOW offers relative immunity from online competition from the likes of Amazon.com.  These characteristics are hard to find within the retail sector.  With regard to financial performance, earnings growth has been very strong over the past several years as solid sales growth has combined with margin expansion to produce high-teens EPS growth since 2009.  Based on continued positive sales and margin trends, we believe the company can continue to put up double-digit EPS growth for several more years.  As such, we think LOW represents good value.  The stock currently trades at an attractive multiple of 15.9 times estimated CY17 EPS, and the dividend yield is 1.9 percent. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft, best known for its Windows operating system, is a productivity software powerhouse that has made the move to the cloud and more of a subscription-based revenue model.  This transition has occurred over the past couple of years and has resulted in flat cash flow from operating activities.  Satya Nadella has done a superb job of changing the culture within the company to focus on making the best productivity software no matter the operating system on which it runs.  Azure is Microsoft's open, flexible, enterprise-grade cloud computing platform that has emerged as a strong number two to leading Amazon.  Office and server tools continue to appeal to commercial enterprises.  We see 2017 as the inflection year in which subscription revenue is large enough to consistently offset the loss of one-time (transactional) software sales.  This ongoing transformation should drive acceleration in revenue growth and margin expansion, leading to increased profitability and cash flow.  The bulk of the big investments have already been made, and the company is nearing its big, slow turn to the cloud.  Shareholder-friendly capital allocation should continue with a 2.5 percent dividend yield and 1 percent-2 percent of shares being repurchased each year.  The stock is trading at 20.7 times estimated CY17 EPS. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) Shares of Sprouts Farmers Market have suffered in recent months due largely to intensified competition and food price deflation.  The company, whose motto is ""healthy living for less"", operates healthy grocery stores that offer fresh, natural, non-GMO and organic food. Sprouts sits at the ideal intersection of natural/organic, affordability and accessibility. To drive foot traffic Sprouts prices its produce offering 20 percent-25 percent below traditional supermarkets, and even further below Whole Foods Markets and other natural foods competitors. This price point means Sprouts is attractive to both the everyday shopper and the hardcore natural foods customer.  Sprouts' footprint is largely in the Southwest, but the company is expanding east and adding 14 percent to its total square footage every year.  We believe that this rate of store growth, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth from its relatively young store base, should translate to mid-teens revenue and EPS growth for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the company generates strong cash flow and is able to fund its store expansion internally while also returning capital to shareholders through a share buyback program. Sprouts is currently trading at 20.5 times estimated CY17 EPS. United Technologies (UTX) United Technologies is a diversified industrial company that provides products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. The company's aerospace segments target both commercial and government (including both defense and space) customers. The company has a fantastic long-term track record of financial performance, with strong double-digit EPS growth, outstanding cash generation, and a rock-solid balance sheet.  However, recent performance has been held back by development costs for the company's ground-breaking new geared turbofan (GTF) jet engine as well as increasing competition and pricing pressure in Europe and China for Otis elevators (both equipment and service). We think the company is taking the appropriate action to improve performance in these two areas.  Once through the current investment phase, we think the company can ultimately return to sustainable double-digit EPS growth.  Based on those expectations, we continue to believe the company offers strong value for long-term investors, trading at 16.9 times estimated CY17 EPS - a significant discount to the overall market.  In addition, the current dividend yield is an attractive 2.4 percent. ",Top 10 stocks for 2017—commentary

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering. The company’s IPO filing included a lengthy disclosure of its risks related to climate-change policies.

Abigail Stevenson,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"While the market continues to focus on whether the Dow Jones industrial average will hit 20,000, Jim Cramer would rather look at how conceivable it is for the Dow to keep running after it does. Good news is that he does think it is possible. ""When you look at how far stocks would need to rally to get back to their all-time highs, you will find that many of these Dow names have been much higher in less fortuitous circumstances,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Cramer boiled it down to 12 encouraging stocks that must advance more than 10 percent to get back to their old highs. No. 1 is Wal-Mart, which would need to climb 32 percent to get back to where it was two years ago. With the strength of Amazon, Cramer recognized that this is a lot to ask and said he doesn't expect it to help the Dow get to 20,000. No. 2 is American Express. The stock has 28 percent to run back to its 2014, and Cramer recommended buying it at current levels. All it would take is a multiple expansion now that the multiple is in favor. No. 3 was IBM, which would have to mount a 26 percent gain to get back to its $216 high in 2013. Unfortunately, Cramer didn't think IBM will get back to a 15 price-to-earnings multiple up from its current 12. ""In truth, IBM should never have been as high as $216. Its earnings were inflated by buybacks and the price was hyped by hoopla surrounding Warren Buffett's anointment of the stock,"" Cramer said. No. 4 was Nike, the most intriguing stock to Cramer. Nike would need its stock to advance 26 percent to reach old highs, and Cramer thinks if Donald Trump can lower the corporate tax rate, it could help move it higher. However, he wasn't confident that it can close the gap between $53 and $67. No. 5 was Caterpillar, which also told investors it's not doing that well. It also would be the most hurt if Trump starts to play hardball with China, but it would also be a large beneficiary to a domestic infrastructure program. Cramer was willing to bet that the stock can creep towards its old level on positive commodity data and cost cuts from Trump. No. 6 and 7 were Exxon-Mobil and Chevron, which need to add 17 percent to get back to their old highs, and Cramer won't count on them to get the Dow to 20,000. ""Frankly, that is just asking too much of these stocks,"" Cramer said. No. 8 was Coca-Cola, and with a new CEO coming in, Cramer was willing to bet that the restructuring designed by outgoing CEO Muhtar Kent means the company will meet its numbers. However, he says the stock cannot be relied on to rally 14 percent to its former glory. No. 9 was Apple, and Cramer thinks the stock is looking like it will break out soon. It must advance a little more than 13 percent, and Cramer is concerned that Apple hasn't augmented its service revenue stream and isn't using its massive cash hoard to make more acquisitions. No. 10 was Cisco, which is still reeling from a downbeat quarter. Cramer wants Cisco to find a way to make it clear that its legacy business isn't hurting it as it transitions to more of a cloud play. He wasn't confident that the stock can rally 13 percent to its recent high. No. 11 and 12 was Disney and United Technologies, which need to rally 12 and 10 percent respectively to get to all-time highs. Based on Disney's theme park attendance, movies and potential to be a beneficiary of a corporate tax cut, Cramer called this one an ""up"" stock United Technologies will have a tough time gaining traction because of its recent strong run. If anything, Cramer expects the numbers to come down. So, while Cramer only found a few stocks among the list that could get back to old highs, many of them reached such high levels in a worse environment. Perhaps they can do it again.

Fred Imbert,01122017,CNBC,01052017,"U.S. equities closed higher in choppy trade on Wednesday, shrugging off a sharp decline in health care stocks following remarks made by President-elect Donald Trump. ""We have to get our drug industry coming back. Our drug industry has gotten disastrous. They're leaving left and right,"" Trump said at his first news conference since winning the U.S. election. The Nasdaq composite fell after Trump made his remarks, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3 percent. The tech-heavy index, however, ended the session 0.2 percent higher at a record closing level. The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent, shrugging off a 1 percent decline in health care. Energy stocks led the way in the S&P, rising 1.2 percent. Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said the stock market has largely given Trump  the benefit of the doubt. He said that would change after the inauguration. ""After that point, his actions will become more important versus what he says,"" he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 99 points higher, with Goldman Sachs and IBM contributing the most gains. The blue-chips index briefly turned lower after Trump's remarks on the pharmaceutical industry. Investors came into the news conference looking for clues about his proposed policies. Stocks in the U.S. have rallied sharply since Trump's victory, amid hope that the incoming administration will cut corporate taxes, deregulate certain sectors and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. Trump's news conference concluded without him providing details on these policies. ""We need some concrete numbers. We haven't sold off because there hasn't been a reason to do so. That said, you're dealing with some pretty nervous longs here,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Our hope is that these three policies will be enacted and a more pragmatic approach will be taken to trade and immigration,"" said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. He also said he expects Trump to wait until the after the inauguration to provide more guidance on his policies. That said, some of the president-elect's tweets have raised concerns among investors. Since Nov. 8, Trump has taken to Twitter to criticize companies that planned to send jobs overseas rather than create them in the United States. He has also threatened to levy a high border tax against those firms. ""What's interesting about Trump is he's sort of managed to work around the traditional news cycle,"" said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. ""The market is also grappling with that, too."" ""Companies like Airbus and Boeing will not only have to think about their input cost, but they will also have to pay attention to (the) PR perspective,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. Separately, Trump's nominee for secretary of State Rex Tillerson, testified on Capitol Hill at his confirmation hearing. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO, has raised concerns among most of the Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Marco Rubio, given his lack of public service experience and close ties to Russia. ""There's so much that could come out from those hearings,"" said Hartford Funds' Siomades. ""This cast of characters is not well known, and the market could react to that."" Wall Street also braced itself for the start of earnings season, as banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, among others, are slated to report quarterly results on Friday. ""I think we're going to get a good earnings season,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. ""The question is can the market sustain the euphoria with what could still be considered relatively modest earnings growth."" In the bond market, meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys traded higher after Trump's news conference, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.365 percent and the two-year note yield holding near 1.18 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after trading higher, with the euro near $1.057 and the yen around 115.38. The pound briefly fell around 1 percent against the dollar, breaking below $1.21. Sterling last traded at $1.22. Overseas, European equities traded higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index advancing 0.23 percent. In Asia, Chinese stocks closed lower overnight, with the Shanghai composite  dropping 0.79 percent, while the Japanese Nikkei 225  recorded a gain of 0.33 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 19,954.28, with Merck leading advancers and Pfizer  lagging. The S&P 500 rose 6.42 points, or 0.28 percent, to end at 2,275.32, with energy leading eight sectors higher and health care the top decliner. The Nasdaq composite advanced 11.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 5,563.65. About two stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 878.84 million and a composite volume of 3.563 billion at the close.

The election of Donald Trump has many wondering whether the renewable energy industry will continue to flourish in the United States. Much to FuelCell Energy's (NASDAQ:FCEL) delight, though, there are several signs suggesting that America's neighbors to the north have no intention of slowing down. Though it's uncertain how advantageous this is for FuelCell Energy, it does represent some interesting opportunities -- opportunities that could possibly translate to ever-elusive profits. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. There's certainly been no shortage of talk about pipelines extending from Canada recently. Stealing some of the headlines from the Dakota Access Pipeline, another familiar name -- Keystone XL -- has been reappearing since Donald Trump revealed his support of the pipeline to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Both leaders' apparent enthusiasm for activity in the oil sands bodes well for FuelCell Energy, which recently revealed its participation in related studies. Partnering with Alberta Innovates, FuelCell Energy will conduct an engineering study for a fuel-cell carbon capture application at a heavy oil refinery near Saskatchewan. According to FuelCell Energy's press release, ""A second potential site, the Scotford bitumen upgrading facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, will also be evaluated as part of the engineering study."" Operated by Royal Dutch Shell, the facility is part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project -- site of the first commercial application of carbon capture and storage in the oil sands industry. FuelCell Energy also revealed in its press release that should the study prove that the application is a success, it could lead to ""a megawatt-scale fuel cell carbon application at an existing gas-fired plant."" It's not just the oil sands that represent an opportunity for FuelCell Energy, but coal power as well. The Canadian government recently announced its plan to phase out traditional coal-power plants by 2030. In working toward that goal, the government will work with four provinces to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coal-power plants. Canada's commitment could benefit FuelCell Energy, as the company began a partnership with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) last spring on developing technology for carbon capture through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. A 2.8 MW DFC3000 fuel-cell power plant. Image source: FuelCell Energy corporate website. Addressing the benefits of this application, Chip Bottone, FuelCell Energy's president and CEO, recognized that, ""Carbon capture with carbonate fuel cells is a potential game-changer for affordably and efficiently concentrating carbon dioxide for large-scale gas and coal-fired power plants."" Testing the fuel cell carbon capture technology with its DFC3000 fuel-cell power system at a 2.7 gigawatt mixed-use coal- and gas-fired power plant in Alabama, the company estimates that the DFC3000 fuel-cell power system reduces approximately 70% of a plant's smog-producing pollutants like nitrogen oxides and remove 90% of carbon from the exhaust stream. Between the oil sands and transition from coal power, Canada's opportunities may very well be sources of revenue for FuelCellEnergy in the years to come. Unfortunately, those years are considerably down the line, and the company has much more pressing issues to contend with right now -- so much so that it may never get to realize those opportunities in the Great White North. Updating investors in December, management reported that it was ""reducing materials spend as well as implementing various cost control initiatives"" in order to achieve its long-term goals. The company, for example, reduced its global workforce by 17% as well as implementing other measures in order to reduce its operating expenses by $6 million on an annualized basis. This would translate to an approximate reduction of 14% based on the $42 million that the company reported in fiscal 2015. Further illustrating the company's precarious position, management noted it was forecasting revenue to fall to a range of $107 million to $109 million for fiscal 2016 -- a far cry from the range of $170 million to $210 million that it had forecast on the Q4 conference call in 2015. No longer a contender for the Beacon Falls Energy Park -- worth a potential $500 million between equipment and service over its life, according to management -- FuelCell Energy is relying on the more than $400 million it has in contracted backlog as of Oct. 31, 2016 to keep the lights on. Any opportunities in Canada that inspire hopes of profits must be tempered by the reality that the company is still struggling to prove the advantages of its fuel-cell solutions to customers.

Investors haven't been happy with IBM (NYSE:IBM) lately. Since Ginni Rometty started as CEO in January of 2012, IBM has seen 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year declining revenue -- essentially every quarter of her tenure. The stock has lost nearly 10% compared to a gain of 78% for the S&P 500 over the last five years. IBM 5 Year Price Returns (Daily) data by YCharts. For IBM shareholders, Ginni Rometty's four-year reign as chief executive officer hasn't been anything to go to Disneyland about. But her company has become a leader in one corporate category: board members willing to shovel incentive pay at a CEO turning in a mediocre performance. With all the negative sentiment and equally dismal stock performance, should investors have any hope that IBM will right the ship? IBM believes it can, and it's betting the future on Watson. You may recall how Ken Jennings, famous for his 74 consecutive wins on Jeopardy, was dethroned by Watson, the IBM supercomputer. Why would a company risk so much on a game-playing computer? The key is not in the computer as much as in the science behind it. IBM's Watson beats 74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings.  Image source: Flickr user edwardhblake. Watson is a system based on artificial intelligence (AI). Computer simulations of the human brain, called neural networks, mimic humans' capacity to learn. Using massive amounts of data and complex algorithms, an AI system gradually learns to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. It is taught to recognize patterns within massive amounts of data. IBM has been betting heavily on Watson by leveraging its AI platform and data analytics for a variety of business applications. The company's CEO has said that, in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of Watson. Several recent high-profile partnerships illustrate how IBM has been approaching this goal, and the strategy appears to be gaining steam. UA Record smartphone app powers Healthbox.     Image source: Under Armour. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) announced a strategic partnership with IBM to leverage the 190 million registered users of its Connected Fitness platform and Watson's deep-learning technology. The system would provide users with individual health and fitness insights backed by data. It is intended to act as a personal health consultant, fitness trainer, and assistant. This collaboration underpins the HealthBox, Under Armour's connected fitness system, which combines a fitness band, digital scale, heart-rate monitor, and the UA Record smartphone app. It will track sleep, fitness, activity, nutrition, and training information, and provide personalized recommendations. This is a valuable project for IBM since Watson learns with each infusion of data. The partnership is a win for Under Armour as well, and is part of a bigger play. Its acquisition of three fitness app companies that now comprise its Connected Fitness platform, the release of Healthbox, and the integration of Watson provides Under Armour with an end-to-end health and fitness solution that connects to its users in a very real way. This will likely drive future adoption and boost customer satisfaction. OnStar Go powered by Watson. Image source: General Motors Company. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) partnered with IBM to pair its OnStar vehicle-communication system with Watson's learning capabilities to create OnStar Go, a cognitive mobility platform. According to the press release, the new platform's numerous benefits include helping drivers avoid traffic, giving them the ability to order coffee on the go, making restaurant recommendations, and reminding users to pick up diapers and formula on the way home. Drivers will have to consent, and Watson will recognize their preferences and patterns in their decisions and habits. This will also develop individualized and location-based marketing. The partnership will present other business opportunities. OnStar has already signed iHeartRadio, which will provide personalized musical experiences, and MasterCard, which will allow consumers to pay for gas and other services from their car. Other partners include ExxonMobil, Glympse, and Parkopedia. iOS enterprise developers get access to Watson. Image source: IBM. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM's partnership was first announced over two years ago but has evolved in the meantime. Initially, the pair planned the development of over 100 enterprise apps for a variety of industries, including retail, healthcare, banking, transportation, and insurance. According to a recent announcement, enterprise iOS users will have in-app access to Watson, opening the door to deep-learning technology for these made-for-business apps. iOS app developers will be able to use Watson's AI as a platform for their own apps. Apple has already benefited from the partnership by gaining inroads into enterprise. IBM announced last year that it had begun to replace its PCs with Apple Mac computers. Employees were given the option to make the switch and 73% chose Mac. In a presentation at Jamf Nation User Conference, a gathering of Mac system administrators, IBM told attendees that PCs were three times more expensive to manage, Macs had a lower total cost of ownership, and that the Mac was the standard at IBM Japan -- PCs were the exception. These recent developments will provide greater validation to Apple's prospective enterprise customers while advancing the company's AI agenda. Apple has an installed base of over 1 billion active iOS devices with a growing percentage of those in enterprise. This, combined with Watson's ability to learn from streams of data, will provide both companies with a stronger relative position from which to compete. These collaborations are merely the most high-profile examples of hundreds going on behind the scenes. IBM tweeted earlier this year that more than 500 partners and 80,000 developers were building products and apps powered by Watson. The installed base that comes with the partnerships is growing, and should eventually show up in IBM's revenue and provide vindication for the company's Watson-centric strategy. IBM expects Watson to contribute $1 billion in revenue by 2018, and $10 billion by 2023, though it doesn't currently break out that contribution. Strategic Initiatives, where Watson's revenue resides was $8 billion in the most recent quarter, of $19 billion total revenue for IBM. It's a relatively small slice for IBM now, but it's clear the company expects to build AI into a major pillar of its business in the next few years. If it works, it might just reverse fortunes for the flailing big tech company.  ","

In a 2015 memo, Clayton and his firm point to a settlement between Peabody Energy and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman when the coal company agreed to add climate-change risks to its annual SEC disclosures. And then reports surfaced about the SEC’s investigation of Exxon, which mirrors the Schneiderman investigation into whether Exxon misled investors in prior years about the risk of climate change. According to a December article by Inside Climate News, since Rex Tillerson became chief executive, Exxon’s official communications have supported mainstream climate science. Tillerson is now Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state. Exxon has put out at least three statements in support of the Paris climate agreement that Trump wants to exit, including calling it the “an important step forward.” At the 2015 annual meeting, however, Tillerson said it might be better to wait for better science before taking action on climate change. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he asked, according to the article. Sullivan & Cromwell emphasizes in one memo, “The SEC also indicates that there have been increasing requests for climate-related disclosures by shareholders of public companies.” Clayton personally represented Crude Carrier Corp. during its initial public offering.

Jack Hough,01122017,MarketWatch,01052017,"Published: Jan 9, 2017 9:49 a.m. ET Why actively managed mutual funds are poised to make a comeback after years of being trounced by ETFs By In 2017, consider committing an act of financial heresy: Buy an actively managed mutual fund. Look for one whose manager is frugal, odd and stubborn—or, put more politely, a value manager with high active share and low turnover. The ideal candidates will have disappointed in 2015 but shined in 2016. We list seven funds for consideration. A long, humiliating period for professional stockpickers might be giving way to something different. Stocks that have moved in near unison in recent years are beginning to chart more distinct paths. Data points that haven’t mattered in a decade, like the ­relationship between prices and fundamental measures of value, are starting to have more sway on returns. The divide between cheap stocks and expensive ones remains exceptionally wide, which could mean last year’s shift in favor of value investing is just the beginning. We know: Recommending a shift to active fund management now is a little like saying the time is right to take up smoking. Evidence to the contrary is vast and convincing. Most stockpickers struggle to beat their benchmarks. Index funds, by contrast, have much to recommend them, ­including simplicity, low fees, and tax efficiency. Investors have been stripping money out of active funds and stuffing it in passive ones at a record pace, and following the herd has never looked so smart. But for tactical investors, the timing might be good for a contrarian move. All that cash pouring into index funds might have flattered the relative performance of the indexes in recent years. And the broad U.S. stock market trades at an elevated valuation. “I have no religious objection to index funds,” says Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of the GoodHaven fund

If anything, it’s better to use an index when the market is cheap.” From here, returns for index investing could underwhelm for a while, and talented value managers should be better rewarded for their efforts. Meanwhile, recent evidence points to better ways to identify promising funds than simply searching for five-year standouts. Don’t smoke. Don’t even vape. But do consider complementing a core portfolio of low-cost index funds with targeted bets on active management—what indexing champion Vanguard calls a core-and-satellite approach. In what follows, we don’t intend to argue that active beats passive, broadly speaking, because too many active managers are either high-fee index huggers or else fidgety flippers who add hidden costs that sap returns. But the question isn’t whether active management as a whole is a good deal. It’s whether any fund managers can reliably outperform, over long time periods or ­under certain conditions, and whether investors can identify those managers and conditions ahead of time. On that question, we’re somewhere between a strong maybe and a sheepish probably. And now seems like a low-risk time to give active a chance. This year will mark the 15th anniversary of a publication that causes active fund managers to toss in their 1,020 thread-count sheets. It’s the Spiva Scorecard. The acronym stands for Standard & Poor’s Indices Versus Active. Among other things, the biannual report now published in eight world regions shows the percentage of active funds that fail to beat their benchmarks. In 2015, 66% of large-cap funds did worse than the S&P 500 index

                                   . That was almost cause for popping Champagne corks. Just a year earlier, 86% came up short. When the 2016 numbers come out, expect them to be damning, too. Since 2000, there have only been three years when most U.S. large-cap managers succeeded at what they do for a living. Results across other size and style categories are poor, too. The Spiva reports beget a steady flow of news stories about the failings of active funds, and investors have been taking action. Over the past five years, passive funds have received inflows of more than $1 trillion. Last year, active funds saw withdrawals of more than $200 billion, a postcrisis high. Active funds still hold two-thirds of mutual fund money. If index funds simply accept market prices as they are, and active funds seek to identify pricing mistakes and exploit them, the stampede to the former from the latter raises the question of whether stock pricing has been affected. In recent years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has tracked a trading strategy that buys what active managers shun, and shuns what they buy, to profitable effect. As cash flows toward indexes, it flows almost by definition against the interests of active funds. Many active funds have taken to what’s derided as closet indexing, in which managers stick close to the benchmarks for fear of being drastically wrong in any single year, thereby marring their marketing brochures. But, of course, that’s a recipe for gradual but certain failure. Active funds have higher fees than passive ones. If the two funds hold much the same merchandise, the costlier one will usually do worse. Research by Martijn Cremers, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, has shown that funds with high active share—that is, ones whose portfolios are distinct from their benchmarks—tend to outperform after fees. The struggles of active funds, it would seem, might boil down to managers not being bold enough to justify their fees. There’s just one problem. A paper published last July by S&P showed that even after ignoring fees, active funds tend to lag behind their benchmarks. If fees aren’t the problem, what is? Maybe there’s ­another, hidden drag on industry returns. Or maybe stockpickers are just bad at picking stocks. There is, indeed, a hidden drag. Trading costs aren’t included in a fund’s published expenses. That makes them a possible explanation for why so many ­active funds underperform even before fees are subtracted. In a study published in November in the Journal of Financial Economics, Cremers looks at how active share and average holding periods jointly relate to performance. Funds with high active share and long holding periods, he finds, tend to outperform by two percentage points a year after fees. Those with high active share and short holding periods underperform. Different is good, but only if it comes with lasting conviction. As for the skill of stockpickers themselves, reliably bad ones aren’t supposed to exist any more than reliably good ones, according to efficient-market devotees. But strange things are happening. Looking at the Spiva record since 2000, the first eight years show 55% of active funds doing worse than their benchmarks. The most recent eight years show 65% underperforming. Fees for active and index funds have fallen by ­similar amounts since 2000. So why are stockpickers getting worse? “I think the big inflows have perpetuated the ­performance of passive,” says John Linehan, manager of the $22.7 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund

                                   “If you own companies outside the index, you’ve been disadvantaged. Nothing can go on like that forever.” In Linehan’s view, passive portfolios will reach a breaking point when valuations become too skewed relative to those in active portfolios, and fund flows are no longer pushing the indexes to outperform. “When people are piling into a trade, it can pay to take the other side,” he says. That happened just after the dot-com stock bubble, which is one of the periods when even average active managers beat the benchmarks. Another such period occurred around the market top in 2007. The stock market doesn’t have to tumble for good active managers to earn their fees now, however. All that’s needed are some changes in the pattern of individual stock returns. One change that could already be underway is a long-awaited comeback for value stocks. Barron’s predicted just such a comeback in “Move Over, Facebook and Netflix: Value Investing Is ­Rebounding” (March 12, 2016).

                                   Such shifts can play out over many years. During the last good run for value stocks, after the dot-com bust, they beat growth in five out of seven years by ­double-digit percentages. Value stocks still look like a good deal now, says Bob Schmidt, manager of the Brandes Institute, which researches market ­behavior on behalf of Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego value manager overseeing $28 billion. Schmidt divides the world’s stocks into 10 equal groups, ranked by the ratio of share prices to tangible book value. On average, he found that over the past two decades, the cheapest decile was about 40% as expensive as the costliest. By last year, that figure had fallen to 15%. The only period close to that was during the dot-com bubble, at 25%. “During the tech-stock bubble, many active managers had a hard time keeping up with Dell, Cisco, and AOL,” says Schmidt. “Until recently, it was the same thing with Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix.” There are other green shoots for active managers, according to Jill Hall, a stock strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. Correlations among stocks have been coming down, and the spread between the best-performing and worst-performing stocks has been widening. In other words, conditions are becoming more favorable for stockpickers, or at least less punishing. Read: Mark Hulbert on the real message behind those plunging stock-market correlations In a report published this past week, strategists at Nomura Instinet predict that the market is at or near “peak passive” and will soon experience an “active renaissance.” Active managers have gone through periods when they struggled to keep up with their benchmarks, followed by periods of mean ­reversion when they outperformed. The last big slumps occurred in the mid-1970s, the years around 1990, and the late ’90s dot-com bubble. “We believe the direction of interest rates is the key determinant of when mean reversion occurs,” the strategists wrote. “Rising rates ­anticipate economic growth, which benefits small-cap stocks, and when small-caps outperform, market diversity increases, giving active managers a tail wind.” Don’t expect active managers to begin beating benchmarks as a class. For talented managers, however, there could be more of what we see among the funds on our list—underperformance giving way to outperformance as the market begins repricing undervalued shares. For purposes of judging the talent of value managers, a poor 2015 is excusable. It might even be a badge of honor. That year, dot-com highfliers soared, and many cheap stocks got cheaper. Moreover, the best managers tend not to have spotless records. A recent Morningstar analysis showed some surprising characteristics among the top 10% of active mutual funds by performance over the past two decades. On average, they trailed their benchmarks in one out of every three rolling three-year periods. The shortfall during those slumps was close to three percentage points a year. During their worst three-year stretches, they underperformed by nine percentage points a year. That said, we restricted our list—compiled in part based on screen results from Morningstar—to funds that did well in 2016, when value stocks began coming around. Closet indexers are generally funds with an active share of 20% to 60%. The funds on our list have active share ranging from the top of that range to well above it. In general, a fund with a high active share works well as an add-on to a passive portfolio. Expect it to have plenty of volatility relative to the broad market. A good fund whose active share is only slightly above average has potential as a core holding, provided its fees are competitive. AllianzGI NFJ Dividend Value

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"The deal, Exxon’s biggest since its 2009 buyout of XTO Energy, is the latest by oil producers across the Permian since last summer, with technological improvements and rangebound oil prices fueling the buyouts. Exxon is exchanging an initial $5.6 billion in stock for leases covering roughly 275,000 acres from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas. Additional payments of up to $1 billion will start in 2020, depending on how the acreage performs, Exxon said in a statement. Most of the wells to be drilled on the land should provide “attractive returns” with oil prices CLc1 at or above $40 per barrel, Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said. Much of the Permian’s oil can be pumped at current prices of about $53 per barrel, whereas the economics of other large U.S. shale fields require a price of $60 per barrel or more. About 250,000 acres is on three large parcels in the Permian, and the rest is on oil fields in Colorado and Louisiana. The Permian land, which Exxon estimates holds 3.4 billion barrels of oil retrievable with current technology, produces about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), most of which is crude. Most of the acreage is held by production, meaning Exxon will not have to rush to add new wells to honor lease contracts. Exxon pumps about 140,000 boepd from its current Permian holdings of roughly 1.5 million acres. The company operates 10 drilling rigs in the Permian and said it will boost that to 25 to develop the new acreage, though no timetable has been set. The deal is the first major move by Chief Executive Darren Woods since he took over from Rex Tillerson, who has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be U.S. secretary of state. Exxon plans to run the acreage through its XTO subsidiary, which operates elsewhere in Texas and North Dakota. Exxon’s shares were up about 0.6 percent in midday trading. ","

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

,01192017,Reuters,01122017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to overhaul a gasoline producing unit and the hydrocracker at its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery in March, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday. The 90,000 bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 2 and the 25,000 bpd Hydrocracking Unit 1 will be shut along with other units during the overhaul, the sources said. FCCU 2 is the smaller of two cat crackers at the refinery. The 125,000 bpd FCCU 1 will remain in operation during the work. HCU 1 is the only hydrocracker at the refinery. A hydrocracker uses hydrogen under high pressure to produce motor fuels, primarily diesel from gas oil. The Baytown refinery is the second largest in the United States and Exxon’s largest U.S. refinery. ","

Tom DiChristopher,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"The world's biggest publicly traded energy company is joining the land rush in the prolific Permian Basin. Exxon Mobil announced Tuesday it will pay $5.6 billion in stock to acquire companies owned by Texas' Bass family that control parts of the Permian in New Mexico. The purchase roughly doubles Exxon's holdings in the basin, adding acreage with an estimated 3.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The assets are located in the Delaware Basin, part of the larger Permian. The deal is the largest oil and gas acquisition in the United States since crude prices crashed in November 2014, according to Houston-based oil and gas research firm PLS. It tops the previous record-setting $4.4 billion purchase of Memorial Resources by Range Resources in May. ""This acquisition strengthens Exxon Mobil's significant presence in the dominant U.S. growth area for onshore oil production,"" Exxon Chairman and CEO Darren W. Woods said in a statement. ""This investment gives us an exceptional Delaware Basin position ... that can generate attractive returns in a low-price environment."" Shares of Exxon were up modestly Tuesday. The Delaware Basin has lately boasted eye-popping land prices. Deals there made up the bulk of last year's $69 billion in U.S. energy mergers and acquisitions. Permian acreage is a prized because the basin's geology allows drillers to produce oil at very low prices and profit from the operations even as a severe crude price downturn extends into a third year. The adjusted per-acre price for Exxon's purchase comes in at about $20,000, ""a very good number for New Mexico,"" said Andrew Dittmar, mergers and acquisitions analyst at PLS. Exxon will pay the Basses, a prominent Forth Worth energy family, up to $1 billion in cash contingent on the land's production. The deal marks the second recent purchase of Delaware Basin assets controlled by a storied energy family. In September, EOG Resources bought Yates Petroleum for $2.5 billion. The Yates family's history in American oil stretches back about a century. EOG paid about $9,000 per acre in that deal, which was also centered on New Mexico's Lea and Eddy counties, PLS data shows. Exxon's deal also comes just one day after Noble Energy paid $3.2 billion, including debt, to buy Clayton Williams Energy. That acquisition focused on assets in the southern Delaware Basin in Texas, at a price of $33,000 per acre, according to PLS. ",Exxon Mobil doubles oil and gas holdings in Permian for $5.6 billion
Fred Imbert,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Thursday, with real estate falling around 1 percent, as investors eagerly awaited President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. ""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued. Bank of New York Mellon and Union Pacific were among the companies reporting before the bell, with Dow components IBM and American Express set to report after the close. Video streaming giant Netflix saw its shares rose 3.8 percent, having posted solid results on strong subscriber growth. Overseas, European equities traded mostly lower after the European Central Bank kept monetary policy unchanged. The euro briefly fell versus the dollar after ECB President Mario Draghi said in a news conference there is no sign of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 19,732.40, with Exxon Mobil leading decliners and UnitedHealth the biggest advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 8.20 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 2,263.69, with real estate leading nine sectors lower and industrials and telecommunications as the only risers. The Nasdaq composite dropped 15.57 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 5,540.08.

 ,01192017,CNBC,01122017,"Following are excerpts from a CNBC interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, from the World Economic Forum 2017 with Steve Sedgwick SS: Patrick great to see you again. Look the world is seemingly a different place 12 months on, the oil price has pretty much doubled. Does that make your job a lot easier? PP: For sure it is easier at 55 dollar then 28 dollar.  . I don't know if the word is easier. I begin to believe that the oil price is maybe a leading indicator of the mood of the world. But you know when you compare the situation one year ago, price collapse to 28 dollar a barrel, and the atmosphere in Davos was not very optimistic. This year is 55 but I remind you two years ago it was 100. So still some gap to do. People are more positive. And at the same time the status of the world did not improve a lot you know, in the one year many events in the Middle East, Brexit, many difficulties appear around the world so, but people are more positive. SS: Well that's interesting because we've seen the markets recover, we've seen the oil price recover and yet we've seen a whole host of quite damning political events for many in 2016 as well. But you think despite those political events the world is actually a more positive place and perhaps a safer place? PP: Safer, no. Not safer. There are many uncertainties. I would say what characterize the world for me today is a lot of uncertainty which is not good for business. There is an economist who was saying at the beginning of the century you have a difference between risks and uncertainty, risk you can manage, you can quantify risks. Uncertainty you don't know. And today what I face is many uncertainty- we are waiting to see what the foreign policy of Donald Trump will be, clearly Brexit and there is huge uncertainty over the future of Europe and how you deal with such a country outside of the European union, plus of course in the Middle East Iran is back because of the agreement last year- it involved many difficulties around. So there is much uncertainty. SS: All right, well you've mentioned three very important areas as well- Mr. Trump, Iran and Europe's cohesion. Let's start off with Mr. Trump as well. How's it going to be for you, do you think actually he's going to change the way that oil companies are going to do business in the US and elsewhere, do you think there's going to be any meteoric changes at all? PP:I think clearly, on energy, there are plenty of specialist of energy in this government, he has strong feeling that energy is one of the advantage of the U.S. economy already today in fact. So he's willing to not put too much regulations in order to help the investment in energy so it's good for energy companies, at least for oil and gas companies, so it's positive I think from these companies' point of view. We'll see then what he will do exactly- because you know there is a difference between what you say and when you are in power. We will see. SS: You say oil and gas companies, the oil companies are becoming more and more gas and oil companies and so the push to cleaner hydrocarbons, to renewables as well, the big investments that you at Total have been in making in green energy, in solar, in storage as well. Do you think a lot of that is actually going to be more difficult to carry on with large levels of investment because of Mr. Trump? PP: Not for gas, you know gas is one the big advantage of the U.S. economy, the shale gas revolution is at the heart of this rejuvenation of the US manufacturing industry, it is energy which is at the core of the capacity of the US to grow their manufacturing industry, to develop jobs. By the way we have invested in gas in the US this year, we have extended our position in Texas, in the Barnett. We just announced a deal with a (company name not clear) a gas company that wants to export energy. So for me US gas is working well. Renewables, we are also shown some progress- I suspect maybe the fiscal incentives which have been planned for renewables maybe will diminish but we will see. SS: That's quite damning in what is arguably the world's largest consumer of energy. PP: Yeah but OK in the meantime renewables have made progress so again it's a matter- I think there will be some debate between the congress, the President so we will see what the outcome will be of all that. But I'm positive, I think the U.S. economy is already strong. So I don't know if Mr. Trump will be able to do it stronger but it seems that it is his vision but we will see what he is doing exactly. SS: It's  no secret that Exxon Mobil and Total, and Total backed by a lot of other companies have a difference of opinion of a way to approach climate change and approach sustainability and what the remedy might be for oil and gas companies. How do you think Rex Tillerson might be as Secretary of State and what does it mean do you think for relations with other players including Russia? PP: There are many questions there. Climate change, Russia you know. I think first, I think the testimony from Rex Tillerson was quite clear- he believes in climate change, then there is the question of what is the strategy of Exxon now that he is no longer in charge. The difference was more between Exxon and Total: Should we involve the company in this green energy business to prepare for the future, that is a strategy decision, we believe that it is a matter of market, not just climate change, if we want to find new growth we can continue in oil and gas but at a certain point demand could peak so we prefer to prepare for the future and invest some of our money in renewable energy storage. Having said that, in twenty years we still remain an oil and gas company. But having also a foot in renewables. SS: And the second point, Mr. Tillerson knows Russia very well, you know Russia very well. There seems to be from Mr. Trump language of a rapprochement with Mr. Putin as well. Do you think it can benefit Total and the whole oil and gas industry? PP: It's not only the oil and gas industry, it's more a matter of world stability. Clearly Russia is a big player, by the way each time you have a new U.S. President- George W. Bush, Barack Obama, now Mr. Trump, first year they all began to engage in a positive dialogue with Russia. We will see if it happens. I hope so, because frankly we cannot have a [inaudible] it's important for Europe too to find a way to stabilize all of that. It's not so easy because the U.S. also like to have a big problem [inaudible]  in front of them. But of course I am an investor in Russia so if it is more stable it is better for me but I think also it is better for the world. SS: if the US is looking for closer relations with Russia. There is concern that it actually doesn't want to continue closer relations with Iran as well. You've made investments looking at developing South Pars as well. Do you fear for those investments? I spoke to one of your peers a while back who said he was concerned about investing in Iran precisely because of what sanctions could come from the U.S. PP: Let's be clear about Iran. There is a sanctions system existing in the U.S. we have to obey to that. There is no way for Total, or any other company, to escape from that. Having said that, and I've been very transparent with the Obama administration about all the moves- we made them aware of what we were doing, we respect what we have singed, we respect the agreements, if the sanctions framework is changing we will have to adapt ourselves. So I will just observe what will be done by the Trump administration about Iran. But you know it is a world where you cannot have many enemies- China, Russia, Iran you have to select things. So we will work and again it is an opportunity for us- you know for Total if you are an oil and gas company you have to go to where there is oil and gas- there is oil and gas in Russia, there is oil and gas in Iran. Having said that I'm perfectly aware there are some risks, it is a matter then of what is the size of the risk compared to the size of the company, and investing 1 or 2 billion in Iran when we have 150bn USD of assets is not a big risk and it could be a big reward for our shareholders. SS: Where is the biggest risk for Total in 2017? PP: The biggest risk? Again, for me it is more the uncertainty internationally, it's very difficult today to tell you what will happen and I suspect it will take some months.   Because I suspect that it's not only if President Trump came to office next Friday, you still have the full administration to put in place before we understand the full policies so it will take time. We are entering into 6 months, 9 months of uncertainty and it's not good for business because what business wants is predictability you know, if you are to invest, if you want to take decisions in energy you invest for 20 years, you need to have clear frameworks so that is the main risk for us. SS: Are you getting a clear framework from Europe as well? We mentioned Brexit, we mentioned the concerns about cohesion within the EU as well. France has got a very big election which is already dividing the population as well, you have of course have had some political experience as well. What do you think about Europe in 2017? Are you worried that we're going to see more of the same that we saw of Renzi and Brexit? PP: I hope no. But I think that clearly for the European leaders it will be a very important year. we'll have new leadership coming; elections in France, in Germany, in the Netherlands and I think clearly, by the way, the position of Mr. Trump is provocative vis a vis Europe but maybe we need to be provocative and I hope for the leaders in Europe, we wake up and we build again the project. Clearly we have a problem today. We have a problem of leadership by the way. It's a question of leadership. We need leaders. I hope the new leaders in Europe will be able to offer a vision to European citizens in order to move the project forward. SS: Don't we have a leader in Europe, don't we have Frau Merkel? PP: Well yes [inaudible] Merkel but maybe we will have the next French President as well SS: ...isnt that your former boss Mr. Fillon. Total: Yeah. And I think he can be a leader for Europe. But again, it's not a choice for me, let me be very clear. I am chairman and CEO of Total, I make no politics in that. As I have said in France, I vote for Total, which is more important for me. SS: Tell us a bit more about Total in 2017 as well. Do you feel slightly less pressure though because of this oil price move, because actually you're renewables division I think from the latest numbers actually some of the profits coming from that as well. It's looking better as well. Do you feel less pressure in 2017 than perhaps at any stage in the last couple of years? Total: For sure, but we have less pressure because we've made huge efforts. All the teams of Total worked hard. We have lowered our break even under 50 dollars per barrel and in terms of cash break even with a profit of sales we're now under 40 dollars a barrel so yes we made big efforts and so over the last two years where we had a lot of CapEx because we had lots of projects or projects to be delivered, we have no higher production and or financials banking [inaudible] strong. So for me 2017 is a new era. We were under pressure. Now we can be more offensive. We have, I would say, a very good status in the company. And our objective is to benefit from still a low price because there is low cost so we want to sanction projects and we want to make new deals to have access to resources like the one we have done in Brazil in December and in Uganda with Turo [inaudible]. So Total has gone through these difficult two years in good shape. And I'm very happy now we can be more offensive. SS: Are you calling time on CapEx cuts? PP: No, no, we have what we announce is that we will spend between 15 and 17 billion dollars of CapEx from 2017. I explained to investors it is a sustainable level of CapEx, with that we will be able to continue to grow the company larger more than the market services, or target that [inaudible]. This is what we want to do. So it's not a CapExs it is landing the CapEx to the sustainable level, which is more important. SS: And in terms of the renewable side of things: You and I were in a debate in Davos talking about the transition, the energy transition, the clean energy transition as well. And there was lot of concern from Christiana Figueres about the speed of transition. Are you happy with Total's investment in renewables. Is it just right?  You mentioned 15 to 17 billion dollars.I think your investments, I mean various figures, 500 million dollars a year is the figure that it's often cited? PP: Yeah. Let's be realistic, energy is a very important matter. I mean we are in the core of the energy, we have invested in renewables we are investing and I believe when we develop a strategy because again we want to remain a major company in the energy field. Renewables we love something.  But today, if I only had renewables Total would be unable to distribute any dividends. It's still an infant industry but we need to work on it. So accelerating is tough because as we were discussing in Davos, people want not only clean energy, people want reliable energy, people want cheap energy, so we have to be pragmatic. SS: Is that the priority with people reliable and cheap, reliable and cheap ahead of clean? PP I think I suspect yes because its energy is at the core of the development, economic development and when you go to India, when you go to China you think people, of course they want clean, to be able to have clean air but they want also to have access to energy which is more important for many people in the world. So I don't think, so I think yes an energy mix will evolve. You will have less coal, less oil, more gas. More renewables but it takes time. This transition is not because you decide. It's not, there is no magic tool there. It's just a matter of investments and words [inaudible]  that people need are serious and pragmatic strategies to prepare the future. So I hear [inaudible]  acceleration I suspect we have to be pragmatic and realistic but again it's a serious matter. SS: There's another great point raised and it's by Oleg  Deripaska of Rusal that he thought that some countries and I'll paraphrase in some countries are pretty hypocritical really they're using renewables as cover for increasing coal production and coal usage as well. Do you think there's a great degree of hypocrisy out there from some companies and perhaps some countries especially. PP: No I don't think, I mean medically I don't think there is some hypocrisy but what Mr. Deripaska pointed is right. What I observe in many countries, because they have a lot of coal, coal is burnt out in China, is burnt out in India, in the US as well, is that and it's cheap to produce coal, much cheaper than gas because gas is complex, you need to liquify it and you need to transport it so what I observe is that you have many countries which try to be genuinely like India, on the road map of two degrees. We have this national production of coal and they invest in solar and wind. One hundred seventy five gigawatts by 2022. And I think the Prime Minister Modi is very dedicated to that. But yes we see a mix of coal and renewables. It's a strange mix but I observe this trend in Germany, I observe this trend in Japan. Japan wants to decrease gas and increase coal with renewables. So there's something there and I think it is one of the for me the main concern about the climate change debate because frankly if we are unable to lower the coal share in the mix, there is no chance we can reach the two degree road map [inaudible] and that requires you to pricing. SS: We need the carbon pricing. Finally, there's a lot of inequality concerns. There's a lot of concerns about the haves and have nots and if Davos is anything it's a lot of haves, it's a very rich concentration of very wealthy and influential people. Do you think the Davos bubble the Davos echo chamber actually gets the message that there's some real problems out there and they need resolving very quick. PP: Yeah you're right. Clearly we are in a bubble and we are in part of the bubble. And Total, when you speak about globalization is one of the winners of this globalisation. We have been able to develop a company. I think what is important to know is that yes we discussed about what is happening around us. I'm not sure we fully understand but there is really a willingness and we have been proposed by Davos to sign a compact about responsible leadership. Responsible leadership for me it's very important. I think big companies like us it's not only a matter to distribute salaries to employees, dividends, social orders, taxes to states. It's not enough. By listening to all of these moves but we need to bring something else to the territories from which we work. You know we have the global company for us for example in France first. Then we moved out. We are moving because we are a global company because the cost of labour is lower in other countries. But if we stay, if we leave the territories behind us without taking care, I think we are making a mistake. Normally the states should take care of that but the states are unable and so it's back to what is the responsibility of a global corporation like Total and I think there is a fourth dimension, salaries, dividends, taxes plus something which is to take care also of our own territories. And I think we need to move on that and not only to think it's a matter for all of us. It's not a problem of all of us. It's our problems because I strongly believe globalisation is a good thing for the world. We have major poverty in the world. We have plenty of emerging countries. But all population in all developed countries seem to disagree so why they disagree because they are afraid so we need to answer them. And it's not only a politician story, it's also a matter for the leaders of large corporations like Total. I don't have the magic tool there again but I am convinced that we need to do that and to tell the people we were discussing these type of matters amongst the leaders of the world in Davos so it's not only we are yes, it's a bubble but this bubble is asking itself some questions. And it's important. ","Interview with Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total from the World Economic Forum 2017"
"Jason Hall, George Budwell, Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Steve Symington",01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Steady income is within reach with these five stocks. Image source: Getty Images. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has an enviable track record of paying and growing its dividend for many years. But at the same time, there are plenty of reasons to skip this biggest of the big oil companies, particularly if you're looking for a solid source of income. We reached out to five of our top contributors and asked them to write about some companies with bigger dividends than ExxonMobil. They gave us compelling reasons to consider oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE:HEP), tech stalwart Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), telecom and media giant Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), pharma blue chip Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and healthcare real estate upstart Caretrust REIT Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRE). Keep reading to find out which of these companies would make a great addition to your dividend stock portfolio. Tyler Crowe (Holly Energy Partners): One thing dividend investors want from an investment in ExxonMobil is stability with modest growth. For decades ExxonMobil has been able to deliver that, even through some of the biggest times of crisis for the oil and gas industry. It's one thing to recommend a company that has a higher dividend yield than ExxonMobil. It's an entirely other thing to find one that can deliver a dividend that has the ability to weather any storm the market can throw at it and even give room for growth. Image source: Getty Images. One that has developed a decent reputation for doing just that over the years is oil and gas logistics specialist Holly Energy Partners. While it may not have the size and scale of many other transportation and logistics companies, it makes up for it with its contract structures and management's prudent approach to growth. All of the services the company provides are done on 100% fee-based contracts with strong minimum volume commitments from its customers. In doing so, it takes out almost all of the commodity price risk associated with the oil and gas industry. Also its modest growth profile is done in a way to maintain a manageable debt level and continue to deliver payout increases. The most recent distribution increase marked the 48th consecutive quarter in which management raised its payout. With its distribution yield of 7.1% and a history of raising its payout in a sustainable, consistent manner, investors looking for a little more yield than shares of ExxonMobil should take a look at Holly Energy Partners. Tim Green (Cisco Systems): Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems has been increasing its dividend at an impressive pace over the past few years. Cisco's quarterly dividend has more than tripled since mid-2012, with the most recent payment of $0.26 per share good for a yield of about 3.45%. Cisco's long-term growth includes industrial users, not just traditional tech applications. Cisco dominates its core switching and routing markets, although growth has been elusive in recent years. The company has been investing in growth businesses such as security and collaboration, but broad weakness during Cisco's most recent quarter and lackluster guidance suggests that a return to growth may take a while. The good news for dividend investors is that Cisco generates a tremendous amount of cash. Free cash flow came in at $12.4 billion during fiscal 2016, putting the payout ratio based on this number at about 42.5%. That leaves plenty of room to grow the dividend even without much earnings growth. Investors shouldn't expect Cisco's rapid dividend growth of the past few years to continue unless earnings pick up. But a solid yield and the potential for modest dividend growth going forward make Cisco a good choice for dividend investors. Steve Symington (Verizon Communications): With a 4.7% dividend that's been raised every year for the past decade, Verizon stock offers an attractive mix between stability and growth potential. Of course, there's no denying Verizon has had a hard time finding growth, given its increasingly competitive core markets. Excluding 2015 contributions of its since-divested landline business, revenue and adjusted net income per share fell 2.9% year over year last quarter, to $30.9 billion and $1.01, respectively. But Verizon also boasts exceptional customer loyalty, with retail postpaid phone churn below 0.9% for the past six straight quarters -- a testament to its continued investments in its market-leading network. And that leadership should only become more pronounced after it fulfills its promise to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. Image source: Getty Images. Meanwhile, Verizon's Fios fiber-optic services are enjoying renewed growth, with FiOS revenue up 4.4% last quarter, to $2.8 billion, thanks to the additions of 90,000 FiOS internet connections and 36,000 FiOS Video connections. Verizon has also made a number of acquisitions to position itself for longer-term growth, including its purchase of connected vehicle solutions company Telogis and an agreement to acquire Yahoo! last July, the acquisition of smart-city solutions company Sensity Systems in September, and its acquisition of fleet and mobile workforce management company Fleetmatics completed in November. The fruits of these purchases will take time to realize, but collectively they should serve to only expand the scope and power of Verizon's business over the long term. And the earlier you buy shares, the longer you'll have to allow the power of Verizon's juicy dividend and compounding returns to do their work. George Budwell (Pfizer): With a yield of 3.88% at current levels, Pfizer offers a slightly richer payout than ExxonMobil. But the real difference between these two income-generating stocks is arguably the tailwinds facing their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. The pharmaceutical industry, after all, is experiencing a golden era stemming from an uptick in innovation, an aging and rapidly expanding global population, and broader access to modern healthcare around the world. The same positive outlook simply can't be said for traditional oil and gas giants like Exxon that are facing significant pricing pressure at the moment, along with the ongoing global transition to renewable forms of energy, such as advanced biofuels and solar. So even though Pfizer has been resoundingly criticized for its hefty price increases on older medicines, the cumulative effect of these tailwinds should be more than enough to offset any political blowback. Simply put, Pfizer should have little problem increasing sales volumes for new drugs such as its breast cancer treatment Ibrance, or its slate of novel vaccines, to drive growth over the long haul. As such, this drugmaker's comparatively high dividend for a large-cap pharma stock should not only be safe in the near term, but it should continue to grow at a fairly regular clip going forward. Jason Hall (Caretrust REIT Inc.): If you're looking for a strong contender for long-term growth in both the dividend and share price, Caretrust REIT should be on your list. Caretrust owns senior housing and healthcare facilities and then works with healthcare operators, which lease and operate the properties Caretrust owns. Caretrust is in an excellent position to grow much larger, as this market is both underserved and will need to expand significantly over the next couple of decades to support an aging baby boomer population. With less than 160 properties today, Caretrust is a very small fish in a very big -- and growing -- pond. If management can continue allocating capital well, Caretrust has the makings of a portfolio-changing income investment over the next 20 years. ","
      
    5 Stocks With Bigger Dividends Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,01192017,Fool,01122017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","
      
    The Best Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors -- The Motley Fool

,01262017,Reuters,01192017,"Last July SABIC, one of the world’s largest petrochemicals groups, said it was studying whether to build a petrochemical complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast with an Exxon affiliate. The project would supply ethylene to other units making derivatives. SABIC chief executive Yousef al-Benyan told Reuters on Thursday that he would travel to the United States at the end of this month to look at the proposed project. “The outlook is still very positive...We will be working with Exxon Mobil to come up with a very strong competitive structure of this project. “We are very excited about current developments with Exxon Mobil, not only the cracker but also in the downstream type of projects we are going to do.” He added that SABIC would probably make an announcement about the ethylene project in the second quarter of this year, though this was not certain. SABIC is keen to invest abroad to diversify its risks and improve its access to foreign markets. Benyan said the company was looking to make other U.S. investments worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. “We think SABIC needs to strengthen its position in the U.S. and leverage the current growth of demand for our commodity business.” He did not give details of the possible investments but said, “Some of them will be partnerships and some will be alone, because I think we in SABIC have the capability to do that ourselves.” Asked about the outlook for SABIC’s sales in the United States under president-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to promote local companies, Benyan said that because of its U.S. facilities, SABIC viewed itself as a local manufacturer. He also said he did not at present see any risk to SABIC’s assets from last September’s vote in the U.S. Congress to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. “This is part of our continuous risk assessment that we have within our corporate finances, but at this point we don’t see any problem, and this will never really change our mind about growing our business in the United States.” ","

Gary X. Ashton,01262017,Investopedia,01192017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Chevron (CVX) is scheduled to release its fourth quarter and full year earnings results this Friday. Investors will not only be looking at how the company performed in 2016, but will also be eager to get a sense of the company’s investment plans for 2017. Oil companies have aggressively scaled back capital expenditures since the oil price downturn in 2014. The chart below shows capital expenditure for ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP), which collectively fell by 47.3% from 2013 to 3Q-2016. This has left some industry experts wondering if spending reductions have gone too far. For example, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih has warned that there could by a global oil shortage as soon as 2020 if investment flows continue to be scaled back. In an investor presentation in November 2016 posted on Chevron’s website, the company says it plans to reduce capital and exploratory spending again in 2017 by about 25% from planned 2016 spending. Friday’s results should provide an update into whether these spending cuts are being accelerated or scaled back in a rising oil price environment. Some companies are already boosting investment spending. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China's largest offshore oil explorer, CNOOC (CEO), is planning to increase investment spending in 2017 between 19% and 39% for the first time since 2014. The marginal spending increase is equivalent to approximately $8.7 to $10.2 billion, or equal to roughly half of Chevron’s entire 2017 budgeted capital spending. 2017 will likely be a pivotal year for the oil industry. Those companies increasing investment spending could benefit if oil prices continue their upward path. A renewed downturn in prices, however, could see those who increased spending nursing large losses. On the other hand, companies that are scaling back investments could see their long term competitiveness eroded, especially if the oil shortage predicted by Saudi energy minister comes to pass. Chevron reports financial results on Friday January 27th, followed by Exxon on January 31st and Conoco on February 2nd.

Patti Domm,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"President Donald Trump could lift sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine by himself — and may justify doing so by saying that he is putting America first. Trump is expected to discuss the sanctions when he speaks by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said in a television interview Friday. The White House also announced that Trump has separate calls with the leaders of Germany and France, two U.S. NATO allies that support sanctions on Russia. ""We'll see what happens,"" Trump said regarding Russia sanctions at a press conference on Friday. ""As far as the sanctions, it's very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally."" The U.S. sanctions, imposed through executive order by President Barack Obama, can be lifted by Trump's pen — without the vote of Congress — if he so wishes, experts said. It's not clear whether his intention is to lift sanctions right away, but Trump's first official discussion with Putin could lay the groundwork for removal. ""People said Trump will never remove the sanctions on Russia. Of course he will. It's a leveling of the playing field for U.S. corporations,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities research at RBC. The sanctions against Russia hurt that country's energy industry and make it harder for Russia to raise capital. Getting rid of the sanctions is a major priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. companies, including Exxon Mobil, were forced to drop activities in Russia if they were in new areas of development, such as Arctic drilling and Russian shale. But Croft explained that European companies, under separate European Union sanctions, were allowed to continue work on existing projects while being barred only from new ones. Based on Trump's rapid-fire execution of orders in his first week, such as directing the construction of a wall on the Mexican border, experts say it's possible he could move toward lifting sanctions against Russia. He could do so without the consent of European allies, which have sanctioned Russia separately. ""Clearly, he really wants this relationship to work. I have some sympathy in the sense the U.S. relationship with Russia has been very badly damaged, and a lot of that has Obama to blame,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of global political consultancy Eurasia Group. Trump has been moving toward lifting the sanctions already. ""He has so many of his speaking points aligned with those of the Kremlin, around Crimea, Ukraine, around Syria, around American exceptionalism and values,"" Bremmer said. Trump also seems bent to to move forward without gaining agreement from historic allies in Europe. ""If I were advising Trump, I would want him to be coordinating with Merkel and others who were steadfast allies ... I think he's made up his mind on this,"" said Bremmer. ""I guess what we've been learning about Trump is that he actually does what he said he was going to do. The problem is the sanctions were imposed for what the Russians did in Ukraine and Crimea. The Germans have worked hard to keep this together, as the French president has,"" said Professor Angela Stent, director Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. ""This would send a message to Russia that it can get away with it, but it undermines the European Union's efforts to hold Russia accountable."" Obama first imposed sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea, claiming it to be part of Russia. ""It's the Europeans who did it much later when the (Malaysian) airline was shot down over Ukraine,"" Stent said. Bremmer expects Trump to move forward regardless of prevailing sentiment Europe, where nationalist candidates stand to gain ground in several elections this year. In France, Marine Le Pen has gained in polls. She says she wants to get rid of the euro currency. ""Germany is the country that's in the most vulnerable position because of Trump, compared to most of the American allies. Europe is getting weaker. He likes Brexit, says other countries should leave. Germany is the country most interested in maintaining a strong Europe, and Trump is undermining (Merkel). Trump is renouncing American exceptionalism, in not telling other countries what to do,"" said Bremmer. At the same press conference where Trump spoke on Friday, British Prime Minister Theresa May was forthright in saying that sanctions against Russia should continue until Russia conforms agreements designed to reduce fighting in Ukraine. Bremmer believes Trump will move forward quickly. But other experts say Trump may ease sanctions slowly — and therefore less visibly — rather than tossing them out right after taking office. Critics have called out Trump for praising Vladimir Putin, whom U.S. intelligence concluded was personally involved in trying to undermine last year's U.S. presidential election and help get Trump elected. Rex Tillerson, Trump's candidate for Secretary of State who just retired as CEO of ExxonMobil, and has strong personal links to Moscow and his former company has billions at stake in Russia. Trump initially refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russian officials intentionally meddled in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic National Committee computers. Trump has since vowed to make the U.S. more secure from cyber espionage, but has said nothing about punishing Russia. There is also another consideration. Tillerson has yet to be approved by the Senate. Tillerson was questioned by Congress on his feelings about Russia. One strategist said Trump may not lift sanctions right away because of the Tillerson vote, expected next week. Exxon has one of the most high-profile projects that was disrupted by sanctions, an Arctic drilling deal with Rosneft. The joint venture with Russian state-controlled oil giant was to explore and produce fossil fuels in Arctic waters, and it represents a big part of Exxon's potential future production growth. The sanctions were imposed in 2014, and Exxon said in a filing after the sanctions were put in place that its ""maximum before-tax exposure to loss from these joint ventures"" totaled $1 billion through the end of 2015. Russian projects were able to find some other funding sources, including China. Rosneft recently raised funds by selling an $11 billion stake to Qatar and Glencore. If the sanctions are lifted, Croft said the knee jerk reaction in the oil market would likely be a decline in prices just because of the prospect of more supply. Under the sanctions, Russia actually was able to increase its oil production, and the decline in the ruble actually helped producers by keeping production costs lower. Croft said the move in oil prices would be temporary, since the new supply from Russia would not be immediate, and Russia is part of a producers group, with OPEC, that has agreed to cut back production to keep oil prices at a higher level. If the sanctions are lifted, one area of immediate interest would be in the potential for Russian shale. The Bazhenov Shale formation in the West Siberian basin is believed to hold massive reserves of tight oil — which can be reached by U.S.-pioneered technology that Russia can't access because of the sanctions — and that could be one of the first places companies might want to invest. ""Russian oil production has been strong, and it's actually increased until the OPEC deal. It could mean a renewal of Western investment in Russian oil, in the new areas in terms of tight oil, Arctic and offshore,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of research firm IHS Markit. ""The taste for big expensive long term projects is a lot lower today than it was when the sanctions were imposed. One area that is very interesting is tight oil in Russia."" Tight oil has been much cheaper to extract through horizontal drilling than deep water projects. ""There's a debate about how prolific it is,"" said Yergin, who said the Bazhenov by all signs is a huge reserve and would take a while to develop. ""If the analysis of U.S. shale is used, it could be very significant. I think all these development take time, and it takes a lot of experience to determine all of these resources and how to recover it. Certainly it would be a whole new horizon for Russian oil,"" he said. ",President Trump could say 'America first' to end sanctions on Russia
Fred Imbert,01262017,CNBC,01192017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Thursday, with real estate falling around 1 percent, as investors eagerly awaited President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. ""Everyone is just waiting for the inauguration,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""The market just feels a little heavy."" He also said: ""When you start seeing volatility in other macro markets — specifically FX — that's going to take its toll on stocks."" The U.S. dollar spiked against a basket of currencies on the back of strong U.S. economic data. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell about 100 points in afternoon ET before closing about 70 points lower, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The index also recorded a five-day losing streak. ""I think this is a pause ahead of the inauguration because there is so much policy uncertainty,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""We don't know what they will be focusing on first."" Trump is set to take the oath of office on Friday. The S&P 500 dropped around a third of a percent, with real estate leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. ""Part of it is people taking profit off the table,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer at People's United Bank. ""We were surprised by the November-December rally, so taking profit off the table the day before the inauguration makes sense."" Stocks in the United States rallied to record highs following Trump's victory in November, on the back of expectations for lower corporate taxes, more government spending and deregulation of certain sectors. ""The stock market tends to like a straightforward story, so if the new administration concentrates on its pro-growth policy actions, the narrative stays relatively simple and shares may find good reasons to continue their climb,"" Robert Landry, portfolio manager at USAA, said in a note. ""But if other priorities compete for the president's energy and focus — immediate repeal of the Affordable Care Act, creation of costly trade barriers and any number of foreign policy actions, just to name a few — the growth story could get muddled and the markets choppy,"" Landry said. Several Trump cabinet nominees were testified before Congress, including Treasury secretary designate Steven Mnuchin. In his testimony, Mnuchin denied that OneWest Bank — a bank he owned — was a ""'foreclose machine.' This is not true. On the contrary, I was committed to loan modifications intended to stop foreclosures,"" he said. Mnuchin also expressed concerns that the ""Volcker Rule"" — a component of the Dodd-Frank law meant to block banks from speculating with customers' money — is actually hurting the country's financial system by limiting liquidity. In economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped 15,000 to 234,000, around their lowest levels in 40 years. Housing starts, meanwhile, spiked 11.3 percent in December, beating estimates. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index rose to 23.6, above a consensus estimate of 15.8. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets in London, said the Philly Fed data shows ""how optimistic the [manufacturing] industry is under the leadership of new upcoming president. This will support the U.S. economy further and strengthen the jobs market further."" U.S. Treasury yields extended gains following the data releases, with the benchmark 10-year note yield breaking above 2.487 percent, while the two-year note yield advanced to 1.238 percent. Yields also received a boost from remarks made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday, when she said the U.S. economy was close to reaching the Fed's goals. Investors in the U.S. also focused on corporate quarterly results as earnings season continued. Bank of New York Mellon and Union Pacific were among the companies reporting before the bell, with Dow components IBM and American Express set to report after the close. Video streaming giant Netflix saw its shares rose 3.8 percent, having posted solid results on strong subscriber growth. Overseas, European equities traded mostly lower after the European Central Bank kept monetary policy unchanged. The euro briefly fell versus the dollar after ECB President Mario Draghi said in a news conference there is no sign of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 72.32 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 19,732.40, with Exxon Mobil leading decliners and UnitedHealth the biggest advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 8.20 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 2,263.69, with real estate leading nine sectors lower and industrials and telecommunications as the only risers. The Nasdaq composite dropped 15.57 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 5,540.08.

Dan Caplinger,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Dividend stocks pay out cash to shareholders each year. The best dividend stocks for investors feature two traits: healthy income and future payout growth. Let's look at five of the best dividend stocks for long-term investors: AT&T (NYSE:T), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Image source: Getty Images. AT&T has been a key player in the telecommunications industry for more than 130 years. With a history that dates back to the invention of the telephone, AT&T was a pioneer in local and long-distance landline communication, and it has taken full advantage of the move to wireless telecom networks to offer a wide range of services to millions of customers across the nation. Image source: AT&T. For dividend investors, AT&T's 4.8% dividend yield is among the best in the stock market. Yet along with that rich payout, shareholders have also gotten a streak of 33 straight years of dividend increases, with the most recent having come just earlier this month. As long as people still want to talk to each other, AT&T will have a role to play in connecting them. ExxonMobil has also been a great source of dividend income for investors. Its 3.5% dividend yield doesn't quite match up to AT&T's, but its 34-year streak of consecutive annual payout boosts holds its own among top dividend stocks. ExxonMobil's dividend has doubled in less than a decade, and investors see a lot more room for growth in the future. Image source: ExxonMobil. What's particularly impressive about ExxonMobil's track record is that the company has had to overcome huge cyclical swings to maintain a stable dividend history. With oil prices having fallen from well above $100 per barrel to less than $30 in the span of just a few years, the energy giant has nevertheless succeeded in tapping new sources of revenue and becoming more efficient to maximize profits. That's a long-term recipe for outperformance that should result in further dividend growth in the future. Johnson & Johnson is a household name best known among most people for its Band-Aid and Tylenol consumer products. But J&J has also become a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and that part of the healthcare giant's business has produced the most growth lately. Add to that the innovative medical devices that the company produces, and it's easy to see why Johnson & Johnson is a popular choice among stock investors. Image source: J&J. J&J's dividends are also superior. A 2.8% yield might not seem to stand out in this rarefied crowd, but a 54-year track record of rising payouts puts it among the top ranks of the dividend elite. With an attractive 7% dividend increase just last year, Johnson & Johnson has worked hard to give income investors what they want to see, and all signs point to sufficient business growth to support ongoing dividend increases in the future. Conglomerate 3M has an impressive track record on the dividend front as well. A 2.5% yield gives investors above-average income, and 3M has raised its payout every year for 58 straight years, putting it among the top-10 stocks in the entire market. The company gave investors an 8% boost to the quarterly dividend last year, and most expect another increase in the immediate future. Image source: 3M. 3M also has a track record for innovation that has put it at the top of its industry, with diversified exposure to a number of different business segments including consumer products, healthcare, and technology. From orthodontic products and Post-It Notes to car-care items and passive fire protection, 3M has made its mark across the U.S. corporate spectrum and stands ready to keep delivering both growth and income to its shareholders. Finally, Procter & Gamble has an impressive stable of nearly two dozen consumer brands that bring in at least $1 billion in revenue each and every year. From Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste to Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, the consumer products giant serves not only the U.S. but more than 180 countries across the globe. Brand loyalty allows P&G to charge premium prices above much of its competition, yet consumers willingly pay for the perception of higher quality. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble has a dividend streak that goes back 60 years, which is the longest of any stock in the Dow Jones Industrials, and it pays a dividend yield of about 3.2%. With the company paying out just two-thirds of its earnings in dividends, P&G has the capacity to reward shareholders even more richly in the years ahead. With a rising middle class of consumers around the world, Procter & Gamble has the products people will want for decades to come. If you want both income and future growth potential, only the best dividend stocks will do. These five dividend stocks give you a diversified portfolio of solid picks that should meet your dividend needs. ","
      
    The Best Dividend Stocks for Long-Term Investors -- The Motley Fool

Matthew DiLallo,01262017,Fool,01192017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. It would be an understatement to say that 2016 was a tough year for the oil patch. Plunging crude prices heading into the year forced producers to reduce investment spending so deeply that many couldn't even drill enough wells needed to keep production flat. Because of these market conditions, oil companies spent minuscule amounts of capital exploring for new oil and gas sources. As a result, the industry found the fewest new barrels of oil in 70 years. According to a report by energy research firm Rystad Energy, oil companies discovered a mere 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) last year outside of North American shale plays. For perspective, the U.S. alone consumes more than 7 billion barrels annually, which meant the industry did not come close to replacing consumption last year. Meanwhile, offshore discoveries, which is where companies uncovered most of the new sources of oil in recent years, fell 90% from 2010's level to just 2.3 billion BOE last year. This trend is not one that can continue given that world oil demand is not expected to peak until 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. Image source: ConocoPhillips. The primary driver of last year's decline was the continued drop in exploration spending. Energy companies only spent $40 billion on exploratory drilling last year, which resulted in 40% fewer wells drilled than in 2014 when prices started on their downward spiral. Global oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), for example, cut its global capital and exploratory budget by 24% from 2015's level to $26.6 billion. However, Chevron only earmarked $1 billion of that budget for exploration, well below the $3 billion budget the company set for 2015. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) cut its global exploration and appraisal budget down to $1.4 billion last year, a decline of 22% from 2015. Another culprit behind last year's low level of oil discoveries is that several exploration prospects came up dry. For example, a joint venture between ConocoPhillips, Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) struck out in its initial attempt at finding oil in the Shelburne Basin off Canada's Atlantic Coast. As a result, Suncor Energy noted that it had to write off its share of the costs, which totaled 105 million Canadian dollars. That dry hole was one of a growing number of deepwater exploration failures for ConocoPhillips in recent years. In 2015, the company noted that a deepwater exploration well in Angola found a non-commercial gas column and another in the Gulf of Mexico did not encounter any hydrocarbons. As a result, it plugged and abandoned both wells, writing off $142 million in dry hole expenses. These and other dry holes drove its decision to exit deepwater exploration altogether. Image source: Suncor Energy Inc. While oil discoveries were down significantly, oil companies still found several notable new oil and gas deposits. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), for example, announced in June that an offshore well in Guyana confirmed a world-class oil discovery. According to ExxonMobil, this deposit contains between 800 million to 1.4 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Then, in October, the oil giant confirmed a discovery offshore Nigeria that holds between 500 million to 1 billion barrels of oil. Finally, the company capped the year off with a December announcement of a new onshore natural gas discovery in Papua New Guinea. Energy companies made several other smaller discoveries around the world last year. Norwegian oil giant Statoil (NYSE:EQNR), for example, finished up its Canadian Atlantic exploration program last year, which resulted in two more discoveries and the confirmation that its 2013 Bay du Nord find contains between 300 million to 600 million barrels of recoverable oil. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell made a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at its Fort Sumter prospect, uncovering more than 125 million BOE. That was one of three new Gulf finds last year, though that is down from seven in 2015. Image source: Apache Corporation. While offshore discoveries proved tougher to locate, North American onshore shale plays continued to be the gifts that keep on giving. One of the most notable shale discoveries was Apache's (NYSE:APA) Alpine High play in a sleepy part of Texas' Permian Basin. Apache believes that there's at least 3 billion barrels of oil and another 75 trillion cubic feet of gas in just two of the five rock formations underneath its acreage position in the region. Apache believes that the other formations could also contain significant quantities of recoverable hydrocarbons. On top of that, several other producers increased their estimates for ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries from their acreage position in various shale plays. One of the most notable was EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), which more than doubled its Permian Basin net resource potential from 2.35 billion BOE to 6 billion BOE. That upward revision came just a year after EOG Resources boosted its resource estimate in the region by 1 billion BOE due to improved recoveries resulting from advances in technology. The decline in offshore oil and gas discoveries will not have an immediate impact on global oil supplies. That is because it can often take a decade or more to turn offshore finds into production due to the high costs and long construction lead times. Furthermore, there's plenty of prior deepwater discoveries to develop as well as a plethora of shale resources to unleash. That said, the lack of new discoveries in recent years could prove problematic a decade from now as producers deplete currently producing fields. Given the forecast that oil demand will not peak for several decades, it suggests that the world will need to continue uncovering and developing new oil deposits. That means the industry cannot continue the recent history of failing even to come close to replacing production because there will come a point where this shortfall will impact supply. Such an event could cause a significant run-up in oil prices while producers race to meet the market's needs. ","
      
    Oil Companies Just Had Their Worst Year Since 1940 -- The Motley Fool

Michael Brush,01262017,MarketWatch,01192017,"Published: Jan 24, 2017 9:50 a.m. ET These are the companies that may benefit the most, according to a survey of analysts and fund managers By Donald Trump’s critics like to claim he doesn’t stand for anything. But that’s just because they haven’t looked hard enough. In speeches, online campaign policy messages and even tweets, Trump has regularly detailed policy reforms especially for business and the economy. These include lower taxes, fiscal stimulus, incentives to bring earnings home and protectionist policies. Though he didn’t add any details in his inauguration speech — and that’s never the point of this ceremonial address — his “America first” theme underscored his intent to enact those policies. After all, those policies basically put U.S. companies and the U.S. economy first. Will he actually get all of this done? No one knows. But with so many friends in Congress, and a majority there, it would be a mistake to count him out. As we’ve seen, prognosticators who discount Trump have a way of ending up looking dumb. So as the new president starts his first week in the White House, this is a good time to take stock of companies that will benefit the most from key Trump business and economic policies, according to Wall Street analysts. Here’s a comprehensive roundup. Companies with sales in the good ol’ US of A Trump has made it clear he wants some form of protectionism as a cornerstone of his economic policy. For better or worse, and whatever form this takes, it’s likely to benefit companies that generate most of their sales at home. Those companies will also get a direct shot of assistance from fiscal stimulus. They’ll get a relative boost from any ongoing strength in the dollar, since this reduces reported earnings for companies that get much of their earnings overseas. Goldman Sachs singles out the following companies as potential Trump policy beneficiaries because they generate virtually all of their revenue in the U.S. Naturally, many of them are in retail, and consumer products and services. Candidates for a Trump bump here include: Lowe’s

That’s because the new president is likely to take steps to block subsidized steel from China sold here below cost. “We are going to have greater scrutiny on steel tariffs and how much steel is imported,” says Marshall. U.S. steel companies will also benefit from a rebound in infrastructure spending and manufacturing. “A lot of them are at 60% capacity,” says Marshall. “We think it could get closer to 80% or 90%.” One of his favorites is Commercial Metals

                                   in this space. Companies with low labor costs The labor markets are so tight at 4.7% unemployment, companies have to bid up wages to get or keep workers. This is why average hourly wages recently saw the biggest jump since 2009, at 2.9%. Now, Trump wants to apply fiscal stimulus in the form of personal and corporate tax cuts, and more spending on the military, veterans benefits and infrastructure. That’s an unorthodox policy at full employment, because it risks sparking so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to get overly aggressive in raising rates — which could spook markets. All of this remains to be seen as a risk. In the meantime, with labor costs clearly on the march and greater wage pressure ahead, thanks to Trump stimulus, it makes sense to favor companies that don’t spend a lot on labor, relative to revenue. A group of low-labor-cost companies suggested by Goldman Sachs late last year has vastly outperformed companies with high labor costs. Analysts at the investment bank expect this to continue in 2017, as wages continue to go up and the market prices in higher inflation. As an added plus, the low-labor-cost companies singled out by Goldman Sachs, below, have faster sales and earnings growth compared with high-labor-cost companies. Consumer-facing low-labor-cost companies favored as winners by Goldman Sachs include: Netflix

                                    QCOM, -0.61% Companies that pay high taxes After Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act lowered taxes in October 1986, large-cap companies paying the highest tax rates beat the broad market for the next three years, points out Credit Suisse analyst Lori Calvasina. So now with Trump looking to lower the corporate tax rate, it makes sense to go with companies that pay high tax rates. Trump wants a 15% corporate tax rate. House Republican lawmakers propose a 20% rate. But even a reduction to 25% would boost S&P 500 Index

                                   earnings by 8%, say analysts at Goldman Sachs. As an added plus, many of the high-tax-rate companies also generate most, or all, of their sales at home. That makes them less vulnerable to steps to penalize importers and bigger direct beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus.

So it seems like defense stocks would be a no-brainer. But be careful here. Trump is also a stickler for costs, and he’s already called out Lockheed Martin

For now, it’s probably better to stay away from this group, as a Trump play. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword,” says Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. It’s also tough to know at this point which defense programs and services will get priority, says Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi. For now it’s probably best to simply monitor the group for trading opportunities. Lockheed fell hard on Dec. 23 when Trump tweeted negatively about F-35 program costs. But it then went on to post 4% gains in two weeks as it recovered from the Trump twitter storm. Infrastructure plays This group is another tough one. Yes, our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling. You see this all the time when you drive around.

                                    SUM, +2.41% But infrastructure plays face three challenges. 1. The earliest the industry could see any measurable spending benefit from Trump policies would be 2018, said economists Kermit Baker of the American Institute of Architects and Ken Simonson at the Associated General Contractors of America at a lunch recently sponsored by Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy. But it’s more likely to arrive in 2019. That’s a long way off. 2. Trump’s immigration policies could aggravate the construction labor shortage. Immigrants make up 30% of construction labor. 3. The group has rallied a lot, despite those challenges. “Our concern is that something will break investor euphoria,” says Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Indeed, this is a risk for all “Trump plays” and the market in general. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5% since Election Day, which means investors have priced in a lot of Trump success. If he stumbles at all in his legislative agenda, the market could reverse itself, especially because investor sentiment is so high. But as we saw during the campaign, Trump has a way of getting what he wants. So any reversal in the market, and especially the names above, on a Trump stumble will probably be a buying opportunity.

,02022017,Reuters,01262017,"The world’s largest publicly traded oil producer wrote down the book value of part of its North American natural gas and crude reserves, some of which were acquired in 2009’s all-stock buyout of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly $30 billion at the time. After conducting an annual asset review, Exxon said the value of some reserves in North America’s Rocky Mountain region should be lowered due to weak performance and its own tepid outlook on the potential for future commodity price rises. Exxon declined to provide its internal forecast for oil and gas prices. Exxon will report estimates for the value of its proved reserves in February. The $2 billion impairment charge likely will reduce the value of the proved reserves. Wall Street traders expect oil prices to stay near their current range, between $54 and $55 per barrel, for several years and for natural gas prices to remain near their current level, about $3.13 per million cubic feet. <0#CLCAL:> NG12Mst The 14 percent boost in capital expenditures and the writedown reflect a delicate balancing act by oil and natural gas companies in an era of extreme volatility after a two-year price rout. The higher spending is not due to rising prices for oilfield contract work or other services, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon’s vice president of investor relations, said on an earnings conference call with investors. “It is, by an large, a function of activity level” increasing, Woodbury said. Exxon’s announcement came after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. The results reflected the slow and steady improvement in the global oil and gas industry as commodity prices inch higher after a two-year rout. The quarterly report was Exxon’s first under Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. Rex Tillerson, the former CEO, has been nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be secretary of state and is awaiting confirmation. Fourth-quarter earnings fell to $1.68 billion, or 41 cents per share, from $2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding the $2 billion writedown, Exxon earned 90 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production fell 3 percent to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this month Exxon said it would pay up to $6.6 billion to double its holdings in the oil-rich Permian Basin of west Texas, the largest oil field in the United States. Shares of Texas-based Exxon fell 1.7 percent to $83.40 in afternoon trading. ","

Tom DiChristopher,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Exxon Mobil beat earnings forecasts on Tuesday as revenues increased, though the company took a $2 billion impairment charge, mostly due to lowering the value of some of its U.S. gas assets. Excluding one-time items, Exxon reported a fourth-quarter profit of 90 cents a share, versus Wall Street expectations of 70 cents a share. Results for the Irving, Texas-based oil giant were helped by belt-tightening throughout 2016. However, persistently low oil prices and weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business weighed on earnings for the full year. ""Financial results for the year were negatively impacted by the prolonged downturn in commodity prices and the impairment charge,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. Shares of Exxon slipped about 1 percent Tuesday. Evercore analyst Doug Teresson said many market watchers were focused on the charge. Including that impairment, Exxon would have missed profit forecasts. ""The market did view the result negatively because they missed the headline number, but that's really only because of ... impairments for Exxon, which are non-recurring. And so the clean results were actually similar to consensus, but they were just messy,"" he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report."" Excluding that charge, Exxon reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.7 billion, or 90 cents a share. In the period a year ago, it reported earnings of $2.8 billion, or 67 cents a share. Revenues for the most recent quarter were $61.01 billion, compared with expectations of $62.28 billion. Exxon said it will increase its 2017 capital spending program, which includes exploration, to an estimated $22 billion. In 2016, capital spending fell 38 percent to $19.3 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings fell from a year ago in all three of the company's major segments: exploration and production, refining and chemicals. The $2 billion impairment resulted from the company's review of its reserves. Exxon determined that some of its U.S. assets' future cash flows no longer exceeded their carrying value. These were primarily in the Rockies. Exxon warned last quarter it would have to revise the amount of unproduced resources it holds if oil prices remained low through the end of the year. In the current price environment, the resources would no longer qualify as proven reserves under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the company said at the time. Liquid petroleum products fetched a higher price than they did a year ago. That was partially offset by weaker profit margins in Exxon's refining business. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon have seen their refining margins shrink as the price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels, stabilizes above $50 a barrel. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry — improved significantly from last year. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $4.3 billion a year ago. Cash flow from asset sales was also higher, hitting $2.1 billion, versus about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last week, the company announced a dividend of 75 cents, unchanged from the third quarter. ",Exxon Mobil profit and revenue rise as the oil giant takes $2 billion impairment
Tom DiChristopher,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Shares of Chevron gave up about 2 percent of their value in pre-market trading Friday as the oil giant turned in quarterly results that badly missed estimates. Chevron executives pointed to lower margins in its refining business and tax charges as drags on earnings during a conference call. They also said layoffs were largely behind them, but the company would continue looking for ways to drive down costs. The company also said it will be able to fund spending and dividends in 2017 with cash generated from operations, following a downturn that forced oil giants and smaller drillers alike to tap debt and other to sources to pay for normal business operations. ""Our 2016 earnings reflect the low oil and gas prices we saw during the year,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson said in a statement. ""We responded aggressively to those conditions, cutting capital and operating expenses by $14 billion."" Chief Financial Officer Patricia Yarrington said on the conference call Chevron is considering more assets sales. ""Additional opportunities are in progress and many will close in 2017,"" she said. Last month, the company said it would lower its capital spending for a fourth consecutive year. Chevron's $19.8 billion program for 2017 will focus on projects with shorter cycles and higher returns aimed at producing oil and gas within two years. That includes more drilling in the the U.S. Permian basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, which is leading the nation's shale oil recovery, Watson said. The company said it was operating 10 oil rigs in the region and planning to add another about every eight weeks, he said on Friday. Chevron also provided updates on its critical Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, which experienced some shutdowns in 2016, as well as its Wheatstone natural gas hub. Watson acknowledged the first phase of Gorgon's ramp-up missed expectations and said Chevron would apply those lessons to future phases there and at Wheatstone. He said the next phase of Gorgon would start processing LNG early in the second quarter. Phase one of Wheatstone is scheduled for mid-2017, with phase two expected six to eight months later. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $415 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $31.5 billion. Analysts had expected Chevron to earn 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. In the year-ago period, Chevron reported a loss of $588 million, or 31 cents a share, shortly before oil prices hit 12-year lows. Low crude oil and gas prices throughout much of 2016 pushed the oil giant to a loss for the year. For 2016, Chevron reported a loss of $497 million, or 27 cents a share. Cash flow, a key measure of corporate health in the oil and gas industry, was $12.8 billion in 2016, down from $19.5 billion the previous year. Chevron spent $22.4 billion on capital projects and exploration last year, down from $34 billion in 2015, reflecting the industry trend of reducing expenses to weather the downturn. Chevron saw results improve from the year-ago period in its upstream business, which includes exploration and production of fossil fuels. The company chalked that up to lower exploration and operating expenses and its oil and gas fetching a higher price. Oil prices stabilized above $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter after OPEC and other major oil producers agreed to cut production. In the downstream segment, which includes refining and marketing fuel, Chevron saw fourth-quarter profits slide both in the United States and abroad. The company broke even in its U.S. downstream business, compared with profits of $496 million a year ago. Integrated oil companies such as Chevron have seen their refining margins shrink on the rising price of crude oil, the raw material for many fuels. Throughout much of the oil price downturn that began in 2014, low crude costs boosted refining margins. Revenues for the quarter were $30 billion, up 7 percent from sales of $28 billion a year ago. On Wednesday, the San Ramon, California-based oil giant announced a quarterly dividend of $1.08 a share, unchanged from the previous quarter, when it hiked the shareholder payout by a penny.

Fred Imbert,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"U.S. equities closed lower on Monday, notching their worst day of the year, as a new measure taken by the Trump administration on immigration sent jitters through the market. President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Friday that would temporarily bar entry into the U.S. to Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian, Sudanese, Libyan, Somali and Yemeni citizens. The order seeks ""extreme vetting"" procedures for those it did allow to enter the U.S. In signing the order, Trump said he pledged to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America."" ""We spent the first two months [following the election] focusing on the positives for companies. What we're seeing here is  that life is not a straight line,"" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. ""Perhaps the market is looking at the other side of things. Maybe the Trump administration is not going to do all the things businesses want."" The Dow Jones industrial average fell around 120 points after sliding more than 223.39 points, dropping below 20,000, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent, with energy shedding 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling 0.8 percent. ""I think it also has to do with what the immigration policy represents [in terms of] the way the Trump administration is going to operate,"" said John Conlon, chief investment officer at People's United Wealth Management. ""The fact is that you've got a major policy that was implemented very quickly. That's causing uncertainty."" The order sparked outrage as thousands took to the streets across the U.S. in protest. Several world and corporate leaders also condemned the order. On Saturday, a federal judge issued an emergency stay to halt the deportation of people with valid visas who landed in the U.S. ""The Trump worries are now beginning to set in,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. ""We're having this ongoing worry effect that could overtake earnings and economic data."" The U.S. stock market has seen a massive rally since Trump's election, with the S&P and Dow advancing 7.25 percent and 9.61 percent since Nov. 8, respectively. ""You're coming off all-time highs on virtually every index,"" said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds. ""It doesn't take much for people to take a breather."" Traders have bet on Trump's promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation that would boost growth, just as earnings have begun growing again. ""While investors were very quick to price in the expected impact that deregulation, infrastructure spending and job growth could have on the U.S. economy, I find it very difficult to believe that after pricing in heavy premiums based on fiscal promises, that investors are not now reconsidering what damage Trump might do by implementing other promises that supplemented an incoherent and ranting political campaign,"" said Jameel Ahmad, vice president of research at FXTM. ""Whether it is building a wall, banning certain nationalities, starting a trade war or pretty much anything else President Trump may do to upset people, it does risk both creating and deepening a negative perception of the U.S.,"" Ahmad said. In economic news, pending home sales for December rose 1.6 percent, while personal income rose 0.3 percent, below an expected increase of 0.4 percent. The data releases come a day before the Federal Reserve kicks off its first monetary policy meeting of the year. The central bank raised rates by a quarter of a percent at its December meeting. However, market expectations for a rate following this meeting are just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""I'm as enthused as anyone about tax cuts (even though we don't know what final form will look like) and regulatory relief (but worried about trade protectionism and immigration bans),"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. ""But to think that somehow the Fed is no longer relevant to both the economy and markets as they step up rate hikes I think is delusional,"" Boockvar said. U.S. Treasurys were mostly steady, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding near 2.496 percent and the short-term two-year note yield around 1.22 percent. The U.S. dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.069 and the yen around 113.7. In corporate news, earnings season continues this week as the likes of Exxon Mobil, Apple, Facebook and UPS get set to report quarterly results. European stocks traded broadly lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.05 percent. In Asia, stocks also fell, with the Japanese Nikkei 225 dropping 0.51 percent. The Shanghai equity market was closed for the Chinese New Year holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.65 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 19,971.13, with Caterpillar leading decliners and Wal-Mart the top advancer. The S&P 500 dropped 13.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 2,280.90, with energy leading all nine sectors lower and consumer staples and utilities advancing. The Nasdaq composite slid 47.07 points, or 0.83 percent, to close 5,613.71. About three stocks declined for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 873.13 million and a composite volume of 3.585 billion at the close.

Rebecca Ungarino,02022017,CNBC,01262017,"Energy, the second worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, could see further pain. Chevron, one of the top-weighted holdings in a popular energy ETF (the XLE) fell nearly 2 percent on Monday after posting disappointing quarterly earnings Friday, and Exxon Mobil and Schlumberger closed down about 1 percent each. Crude oil, which has generally moved in tandem with energy names for the last year, has fallen 2 percent in 2017. In a note Monday, Miller Tabak managing director Matt Maley said the XLE is nearing a critical multiyear trend line that if broken could mean the energy sector ""is getting quite close to a compelling decline."" In addition, some strategists noted, futures traders' crude oil positions as expressed in commitment of trader data are at historic extremes, with their longest positions on record. This is quite the contrarian indicator, Maley wrote, as the ""specs"" are ""almost always wrong at extremes."" ""In other words, there are A LOT of people on the bullish side of the boat in crude oil,"" Maley wrote, while ""commercials"" in the energy space have their largest short positions ever. The extreme positioning gives pause to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who sees downside ahead for energy. ""Now when you talk about energy stocks, you have to remember it was the best-performing sector last year, but most of that was a function of a reversal of it being the worst-performing sector for much of 2014 and 2015. And the bulk of that gain came in the early part of last year. So if you weren't overweight energy stocks by April, you missed out on most of the outperformance,"" Krinsky said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" And now, Krinsky said, the opposite is occurring; the XLE relative to the S&P 500 as well as on an absolute basis is beginning to break down below its uptrend line back to early 2015, echoing some of Maley's sentiment. However, Eddy Elfenbein, editor of the Crossing Wall Street blog, likes energy at this juncture in light of recently agreed-upon production cuts from OPEC.   ""I think it's just an unwinding of some of the recent trades. I mean, oil has had a spectacular year since the lows of about a year ago,"" Elfenbein said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""    The XLE is up 25 percent in the last year. Elfenbein noted the energy sector's poor performance over the last seven weeks or so, but sees upside in roughly six months to a year as crude oil production cuts will take some time to play out.    ""The key, this is the big game changer is that the OPEC cuts that they announced in November, these were the first major cuts in eight years, they're actually working. OPEC… they never cooperate. And it really is working this time,"" Elfenbein said, adding that such cuts had put a ""floor"" of sorts at the $50 a barrel level.     Still, the technicals in Krinsky's eyes don't appear promising.   ""We don't think it's going to be anything like we saw in 2015, but [the] XLE probably has some more downside, lower to mid-60s,"" Krinsky said, adding that although the ETF is still well above its 200-day moving average, the extreme positions are reason enough to believe underperformance will continue in the near term.

ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) peers have written down and impaired the value of several of their assets since the beginning of this oil and gas downturn, but ExxonMobil had not yet done so. That changed this past quarter when the company took a $2 billion hit to the bottom line. Despite that large asset charge, ExxonMobil's results weren't all that bad. Let's take a look at the numbers to see why the fourth quarter should give some hope for the coming year. Image source: Getty Images. Data source: ExxonMobil earnings release. * In millions, except per-share data. Last quarter, management gave everyone a heads-up that we should expect a sizable asset writedown this quarter. Well, we got it. Management took a $2.02 billion asset impairment, mostly related to its dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains. This is a little bit of a surprise, actually. Based on the statement last quarter about taking oil and gas reserves off the books, there was the assumption that assets like its Canadian oil sands would be impaired. This writedown is pretty revealing, though. Management does writedowns based on discounted cash flows for those assets and the current carrying values of those assets. So reading the tea leaves into this impairment charge, we can come to two conclusions: The long life aspect of Canadian oil sands means that their asset value may not face as much risk as many might assume, and that there has been a permanent structural shift in natural gas production and pricing in the U.S. Aside from that one big change, the rest of ExxonMobil's results were par for the course. Downstream and chemical results suffered slightly from rising crude oil prices that impacted feedstock costs for these segments, and some favorable tax-related items gave its corporate segment a rare gain. DATA SOURCE:  EXXONMOBIL EARNINGS RELEASES. CHART BY AUTHOR. The one bright spot in the quarter was ExxonMobil's cash from operations. The $7.4 billion in cash was more than enough to cover its $4.8 billion in capital expenditures for the quarter, but fell just short of also covering the $3.1 billion in dividend payments. The $2.1 billion in asset sales helped to make up for the rest without having to take on any additional debt, something few integrated oil and gas companies have been able to do lately. Management quickly put that excess cash generation to work as it reduced total debt by $3.4 billion to $42.8 billion. Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury gave his typical ""just the facts"" conference call, where he pointed out on multiple occasions that the company was generating more cash from operations than its capital budget. He said: ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day and maintain focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015, as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to push -- pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance, combined with continued investment and cost discipline, generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion, and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered the dividend and net investments in the business. ExxonMobil's results, even adding in the large asset impairment, weren't that bad. The big asset charge hides the fact that the company's cash generation has improved significantly compared to the prior quarter and portends a much better 2017. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of ExxonMobil, its analyst day presentation is on March 1, where it will go into detail about its production and spending outlook for the next several years.

    ExxonMobil's Earnings Slip on a Rare Writedown -- The Motley Fool

Tyler Crowe,02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

    ExxonMobil's Management Has Lined Up Some Big Things for 2017 -- The Motley Fool

  "
Rich Smith,02022017,Fool,01262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","

Barbara Kollmeyer,02022017,MarketWatch,01262017,"Published: Jan 31, 2017 3:39 p.m. ET Critical information for the U.S. trading day By Traders begging for nonpresidential drivers may get exactly that today, thanks to Apple and the start of a Fed meeting. “This week was supposed to be dominated by central banks’ decisions, earnings, and economic data from across the globe, but with Donald Trump in office, nothing seems capable of taking the spotlight from the White House.” That was FXTM strategist Hussein Sayed in a note that pretty much nails the mood. The jitters look set to stick around today, with some youngsters in for a #SaturdayNightMasscare history-refresher after Trump sent a defiant attorney general packing: Much debate now surrounds just when to start worrying about politics in earnest, and Sayed has one answer: “The major risk looming now is the breakup of the Republican coalition, although this doesn’t seem to be the case for now. I believe it’s going to be the biggest risk to financial markets in the near future, as we end up with protectionist policies without the implementation of fiscal policies, thus triggering a sharp reversal in stocks worldwide.” Our call of the day echoes this a bit. From Macro Man blogger Macronick comes the warning that markets could be headed for an “escalator up, elevator down” selloff. And “even a garden-variety 5% dip in the S&P would feel pretty vicious,” given the subdued state of volatility over the last two months, the blogger adds. If the Trump administration “overplays its hand,” eroding its relationship with the GOP, its much-anticipated infrastructure spending and tax-cut programs could get delayed or downsized, Macronick says. Then, harking back to the debt-ceiling shock of 2011, a prolonged political upset could start to hit growth and business confidence. Next would come a reflation reversal for stocks. While we’re not there yet, there’s plenty of time for more fireworks, says Macronick. “Investors have been viewing Trump as a second coming of Reagan,” the blogger adds. “They should remember his presidency may yet end up bearing much in common with Nixon’s—a period marked by widespread civil unrest and extreme animosity between the White House and press.” To be sure, strategists have been warning about Trump-inspired selling for a while, and the market has instead scored records.

The stock rose 6.6 percent to 6,795 pence as of 0920 GMT, making it the top gainer on the FTSE 100 index .FTSE Dublin-based DCC, which gets nearly half of its profit from Britain and Ireland, has been expanding into western Europe in recent years through acquisitions. Esso’s retail petrol station network has 142 company-operated sites and contracts to supply 108 Esso-branded dealer-owned stations, DCC said. The business will be integrated into DCC’s energy unit and DCC will sign a long-term supply agreement with Esso Norge. The acquisition is “high quality” and “meaningful”, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note, citing expected return on acquisition capital of nearly 15 percent in the first full year of ownership. The firm has an “overweight” rating on the stock. The transaction is expected to close in the final calendar quarter of 2017, the company said. The Norwegian acquisition follows DCC’s deal in November to buy a 97 percent stake in French natural gas retail and marketing business, Gaz Europeen, for an enterprise value of 110 million euros (96 million pounds). Separately, DCC said on Tuesday the group operating profit for the third quarter ended Dec.31, 2016 was “strongly ahead” of the prior year and in line with its expectations, helped by strong performance of its energy unit.

Tyler Crowe,02092017,Fool,02022017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For the past several years, the name of the game in the oil and gas business has been cutting capital spending to stay within cash flows. That's not exactly easy when oil prices are in decline. Now that the oil-price ship seems to have found its course again, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) management is talking about some of the things it wants to accomplish, since it's generating enough cash to pay for it. Here are some quotes from ExxonMobil's most recent conference call that show where the company is seeing a lot of promise, as well as how it plans to address some shareholder concerns. Image source: Getty Images. With ExxonMobil's analyst day coming up, Senior Vice President Jeff Woodbury didn't give a whole lot of detail on plans for 2017 and beyond, aside from this little tidbit: Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our analyst meeting. That figure stands in comparison with the $19.3 billion the company spent in 2016. When pressed about the uptick in spending, particularly whether it was from raising costs from service companies, Woodbury explained that a large part of that spending is for higher activity and incremental gains, mostly in its upstream production. ExxonMobil and the other integrated majors have been criticized for not embracing shale more and making it a bigger part of the portfolio. As Woodbury points out, though, that slower growth has more been focused on learning how to attack its holdings in the most economical way. As a result, the company is now leveraging that learning period into production gains: Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate 2/3 of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO [Energy, an ExxonMobil subsidiary] has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11%, and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Things like this can get lost in the fray of such a large company, but shale is becoming a stronger part of the business. Last month, ExxonMobil made a big splash by acquiring a large acreage position in the Permian Basin for $5 billion. The Permian has been a hot commodity because of the great well economics it produces. It's not that surprising, then, to hear Woodbury extol the virtues of this new asset and how much potential it has for the company in the coming years, as well as its potential for profit. I've highlighted a section that should really get investors excited: Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil-equivalent barrels in multiple stacked pace -- plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from upstream research company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play, which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market-leading development cost. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths 2 miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drilled wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017, as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Liquefied natural gas has been a pretty hot topic for investors as of late, and ExxonMobil just received approval for its Golden Pass LNG facility from the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee. While there is certainly a long-term opportunity for LNG, Woodbury explained that ExxonMobil isn't in a rush to develop this asset because there is going to be some short-term lumpiness in the LNG market: Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you're going to have periods in which there's oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects that -- well, there's a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply. Now if I step back from that, that's the -- if you will, the value proposition, and I step back, we've got a very extensive portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments -- that is, incremental investments to the existing operations, like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass -- provide us [an] economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA [free-trade-agreement] export authorization, and we're hoping that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of the -- that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing long-term sales contracts. Several of ExxonMobil's competitors have either come under scrutiny for executive pay or have recently changed their executive-pay contacts. When asked about this, Woodbury said why he thinks the system the company has in place is best suited for long term investors and why ExxonMobil will probably hang on to its current structure: [R]emember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we're making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about five years; the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really, it's the later of 10 years or retirement, so some of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I'll tell you that the Compensation Committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors, and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. Anyone investing in this company for a decade or more has to be encouraged that executive pay with these companies is structured on such a long-term time horizon, as the incentives for management are much more in line with the investment time horizon for its shareholders.

Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016. In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 ""earnings"" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015. Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is ""pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders,"" and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock. So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left? CONSOL Energy asks: Might we interest you in a coal spin-off? Image source: Getty Images. In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as ""purchased gas sales,"" ""freight-outside coal,"" and ""other outside sales."" Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not: According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in ""other costs"" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business. Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off. So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business. Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation. There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion. What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go? In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not. ","
