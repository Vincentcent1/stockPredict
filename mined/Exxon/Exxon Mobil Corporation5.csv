John Bromels,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","
      
    What Hurricane Harvey Means for Oil Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

Philip van Doorn,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

                                   which was established in December 2014 and invests in derivatives so that the fund’s value will go up when S&P 500 companies raise their dividends. Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

John Bromels,08312017,Fool,08242017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Unprecedented rains and flooding from deadly Hurricane Harvey, which hit a number of Texas cities including Houston and Corpus Christi over the weekend, are still occurring. The extent of the damage is as yet unknown but is expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. Obviously, the storm's effects on the stock market are of far less concern than its impact on its victims, and investors' financial worries pale in comparison to the tremendous losses many of the people of Texas are suffering right now. But as Harvey moves out of the area, it's important for investors to be prepared for what they will find in their portfolios as cleanup begins. Let's look at the storm's impact on big Texas-based oil companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier (NYSE: HFC), Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA), and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hurricane Harvey has flooded the Houston area, disrupting the oil and gas industry. Luckily, these disruptions are likely to be short-lived. Image source: Getty Images. As Harvey approached the Gulf Coast, companies were forced to take immediate preventative measures. These included shutting down refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, where more than 25% of the nation's refining capacity is located. ExxonMobil shut down its Baytown refinery in Houston, the second-largest refinery in the country, which processes 560,000 barrels of oil per day.  Other major refineries, like Marathon Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery (460,000 barrels a day), were operating on reduced capacity as floodwaters and unsafe conditions prevented employees from reaching work. Overall, Harvey knocked out more than 10% of the country's refining capacity. Besides refineries, many offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had to be evacuated to ensure worker safety or shut down due to pipeline issues. Anadarko, for example, had to evacuate four of its 10 Gulf platforms and shut down four more. As of Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said workers had been removed from 86 of the 737 manned oil and gas platforms in the Gulf. Onshore operations were also affected: ConocoPhillips ceased all of its operations in the inland Eagle Ford Shale. The storm wasn't just a concern for industrial facilities. Companies whose headquarters are located in or near Houston were forced to close their administrative offices due to flooding. Apache announced its Houston office would be closed on Monday, but that it would ""provide regular updates."" Although Anadarko's headquarters in The Woodlands, just north of Houston, ""has not been significantly damaged to date by the storm,"" according to a company press release, Anadarko was shutting down its offices ""until further notice"" in response to the flooding. Shares of both companies dropped in response. It may be days, weeks, or -- in the case of hard-hit refineries -- even longer before inspections and cleanup can occur and normal operations can resume. But the good news is, they will almost certainly resume, and so any disruptions in stock price should be temporary. Much of the coverage of Harvey's impact on the oil and gas industry has focused on the rise in gasoline prices that the storm has caused. Estimates ranged from $0.05/gallon increase to more than $0.25/gallon. You might think that would be good news for oil companies. But it's more complicated than that. You see, those higher gas prices aren't caused by a spike in crude oil prices. In fact, oil prices -- especially West Texas Intermediate -- have dropped over the last week as Harvey approached. That means that companies that exclusively produce oil, like ConocoPhillips, Apache, and Anadarko, aren't seeing any benefit. The primary beneficiaries are actually oil refiners. That might seem counterintuitive, considering it's the refineries that were shut down due to the storm. But refiners make money off of what's known as the crack spread, which is the difference between the price of unrefined crude oil and the price of refined products like gasoline. With the price of oil down and gas prices up, the crack spread increases, which means a big payday for refiners. Already, Marathon Petroleum -- despite the reduced capacity at Galveston Bay -- has seen its stock rise more than 5% since Aug. 22. Shares of HollyFrontier, which operates five refineries -- none of which are anywhere near the Gulf of Mexico -- have risen more than 15% during that time. Big integrated majors like ExxonMobil are unlikely to see any substantial effect from the storm. Because they are big international companies, U.S. refining only accounts for a tiny fraction of their overall revenue. Exxon, for example, has derived less than 10% of its 2017 earnings so far from overall U.S. downstream activities, which includes refining. Likewise, pipeline operators may see some small benefit to their business as refinery shutdowns require oil and gas to be piped longer distances. Because pipeline operators generally use a ""toll booth"" pricing model, longer distances translate to higher revenue. Most pipeline companies and integrated majors have seen stock gains of 1%-4% since Aug. 22. But the most important thing to know is that all of these changes are likely to be temporary. As big a disaster as Hurricane Harvey seems likely to be, it's important for investors not to make hasty buy or sell decisions in response. The reactions to past disasters shows that most effects on stock prices tend to be temporary. After Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, for example, stocks of companies like ExxonMobil, Apache, and Anadarko spiked. But by mid-October, all three had dropped below their pre-Katrina levels. June 2001's Tropical Storm Allison -- which, like Harvey, flooded Houston -- had similarly short-lived effects. The bottom line: Keep a cool head and base your buying and selling decisions on stocks' fundamentals as opposed to news headlines. Remember that you're investing for the long term, and even major natural disasters tend to have short-lived effects on the market. That said, if a disaster drives a cheap stock further into bargain territory, there may be a compelling reason to pick up some shares. ","

Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to the world's most famous stock market indexes, nothing tops the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI). Created by Charles Dow in 1896, the Dow is the second-oldest stock market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which Charles Dow also created. When it was originally formed, the Dow was composed of just 12 companies, including American Tobacco, Chicago Gas, U.S. Rubber, and American Cotton Oil. Today, the Dow includes 30 multinational companies that range from tech giant Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of more than $800 billion, to property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies, which is minute by comparison with a $35 billion market cap. Throughout the Dow's history, it has changed its component stocks more than 50 times, basing those changes partly on innovation and the shifting American economy. Today, we'll take a closer look at which six current Dow components have managed to hang around the longest. Image source: General Electric. As far as Dow components go, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is a veritable relic. It's the only company that has been in the Dow since the index was formed in 1896. GE was briefly bounced from the Dow for seven months between September 1898 and April 1899, and for three months between April 1901 and July 1901, but it has otherwise been a foundation of the Dow for the past 121 years. General Electric's diversified business model has been a key to its long-term success. A recent divestiture of its financial arm, which is now known as Synchrony Financial, should allow the company to return to its roots and focus on industrial equipment. Manufacturing everything from wind turbines to MRI machines for hospitals, GE's diverse operating portfolio has been a reliable source of long-term profitability. Image source: Getty Images. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a member of the Dow since Oct. 1, 1928, which is when the index was expanded from 20 components to 30 components. However, in the records of this historical event, Exxon's name is nowhere to be found: Back in 1928, the company was known as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. The company wasn't unveiled to the world as ""Exxon"" until 1972, and it didn't become ExxonMobil until its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. Being one of the largest oil and gas companies on Earth certainly has its perks. ExxonMobil has been able to use its vertically integrated operations to hedge against considerably lower crude prices since 2014; while falling oil prices hurt the exploration and production business, they benefit the refining business. Exxon also recently uncovered a huge oil field off Guyana's coast that could contain up to 2 billion barrels in reserves. ExxonMobil's future looks bright, and its spot in the Dow seems secure for now. Image source: Procter & Gamble. Perhaps known best for Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, and its dozens of other consumer products, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) wound up being added to the Dow on May 26, 1932, and it's been there ever since. The never-ending demand for P&G's products has a lot to do with its longtime Dow membership -- and its success. Since the beginning of 1970, Procter & Gamble's stock is up nearly 3,000%, and if you include the dividends it has paid out, that return spikes to 6,600%. P&G's secret sauce is a combination of steady consumer demand and great marketing. Procter & Gamble sells many products that, like the aforementioned detergent and toothpaste, are purchased regardless of whether the economy is booming or in recession. This gives P&G reliable pricing power. The icing on the cake is that few, if any, companies spend more on advertising each year than P&G, which keeps its products at the front of consumers' minds. DuPont's chemicals help protect farmers' crops in order to maximize their yield. Image source: Getty Images. Chemicals giant DuPont (NYSE:DD) is fourth in line in terms of seniority: In 1935, DuPont, along with National Steel, replaced Borden and Coca-Cola on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This coming November will mark the company's 82nd consecutive year on the index, though the company also spent 18 months on the Dow back in the mid-1920s. Chemical companies like DuPont are cyclical in nature, so they rely on the U.S. economy to expand in order to grow their business. Thankfully, even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, expansionary periods tend to last much longer than recessions, which has fueled DuPont's growth. Its future is looking even brighter now that U.S. antitrust regulators have given the company the green light to merge with rival Dow Chemical (no relation to the index we've been discussing). Image source: United Technologies. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), which is involved in everything from elevators to climate control and aerospace systems for aircraft, did a couple of brief stints on the Dow in the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1939 that it gained a solid position on the index. United Technologies, then known as United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, has been a Dow fixture ever since. Like some of its more senior Dow components, United Technologies is a cyclical company that relies on a growing U.S. economy to increase demand for its products and services. The company's diversification is what's really been its foundation all these years. Its main business units -- Otis Elevator, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, UTC Aerospace Systems, and UTC Climate, Controls & Security -- each produce roughly 20% to 30% of its annual sales. Image source: Getty Images. There's a sizable gap in ""seniority"" between fifth-place United Technologies and sixth-place 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has been a Dow component since Aug. 9, 1976. 3M is best-known for its Post-It notes and Scotch Tape, though it also makes laminates, protective equipment, medical and dental products, and car-care products, to name a few things. When it joined the Dow, it was called Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing -- thank goodness for the name change to 3M in 2002! For the time being, 3M's four-decade tenure within the Dow looks safe, given its diversified product portfolio. Of course, investors in 3M are also accustomed to the cyclicality associated a company that relies on consumers to drive results. But with 3M's stock up 2,700% since it joined the Dow 41 years ago (6,400% including dividends), few of its long-term investors are liable to complain. ","

Philip van Doorn,08312017,MarketWatch,08242017,"Published: Aug 27, 2017 8:41 a.m. ET If production cuts cause crude-oil prices to rise, the beleaguered Big Oil companies could finally rebound By If you think oil prices can remain at around $50 a barrel, or even rise, then shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron look ripe for purchase, especially if you’re seeking dividend income. Shares of both companies have fallen this year, pushing their dividend yields above 4% as some investors have been waiting for a better moment to jump onto the oil-recovery bandwagon. In his daily Energy Report on Tuesday, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, provided hope to oil bulls, saying “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply,” not only because of OPEC’s production cuts, but because of “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic crude supplies fell for the eighth straight week, by 3.3 million barrels, in the week ended Aug. 18. Coincidentally, both Big Oil companies are undergoing CEO transitions. Darren Woods took over the top job at Exxon Mobil Corp.

                                   energy sector has performed in the past three years: Exxon and Chevron, which together make up 44% of the S&P 500 energy sector’s market value, have fared much better than the sector, and, of course, oil itself, over the three-year period. But it’s been a difficult 2017 for both, with Exxon down 13% and Chevron down 7%, with dividends reinvested. The stocks’ attractive dividend yields may help explain why they have held up decently, compared with the price of oil. “We are comfortable with Big Oil. We would favor Chevron, of the two,” said Mike Bailey, the director of research at FBB Capital Partners, who said in an Aug. 22 interview that he would feel confident buying more shares of Chevron for clients today. FBB Capital Partners is based in Bethesda, Md., and has about $1 billion in assets under management. One way to gauge a company’s ability to maintain and raise dividend payments is to compare its free cash flow per share to its dividend. A company’s free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. This is money that can be used to increase dividends, repurchase shares, fund acquisitions or other business expansion. However, during a time of tremendous volatility for oil and with very long-term capital-spending programs in place, this measure isn’t something you can really hang your hat on. That being said, Chevron’s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has been $1.85, according to FactSet. That’s less than half of its annual regular dividend payments of $4.32 a share. Exxon’s free cash flow over the past four quarters has been $3.42, which exceeds its annual regular dividend payments of $3.08. But the reason Bailey feels better about Chevron is that he is taking a much longer-term view. “A lot of Chevron’s massive capital-spending plans are winding down,” which will “free up a lot of their cash,” he said. “Exxon’s spending is more of a ‘steady state.’ We prefer a cleaner spending profile.” But Bailey also has a favorable view of the oil market, because of a “fairly reasonable balance between supply and demand.” He sees little chance of oil falling back to a range in the $20s, and little chance of dividend cuts by Chevron or Exxon. Going further, Bailey said domestic shale-oil producers were focusing on “low-hanging fruit,” including low-cost fracking in the Permian Basin in Texas. As companies work through the lower-cost production basins, “they will have to go after the more expensive stuff,” he said. “This will push costs up, which will push supply down, and then push prices flat to up.” Eric Ervin, the CEO of Reality Shares, said Chevron and Exxon were “among the healthier” energy companies in the S&P 500, but that his focus on dividend growth made neither company especially attractive.

Chevron last raised its dividend to the current quarterly payout of $1.08 a share from $1.07 in November, after leaving the payout rate unchanged since May 2014. Exxon raised its quarterly payout to 77 cents a share from 75 cents in May, after previously raising the dividend from 73 cents in May 2016. Exxon’s long-term debt has more than tripled over the past four years to $24.75 billion as of June 30, while Chevron’s long-term debt has increased 89% to $33.90 billion. “You cannot exactly fault them for borrowing money when rates are low. But maybe you can fault them for borrowing money to pay dividends,” Ervin said. But he also said the companies had made clear commitments to shareholders by maintaining and increasing dividends, despite the reduced profitability and cash flow from the oil-price decline. “If you are a stock picker, you can consider this an opportunity, [because] you are not buying them at year-ago highs,” Ervin said. But he also cautioned that if the price of oil declines significantly from here, “you might be looking at 3% yields after dividend cuts.” And, of course, those dividend cuts would be very likely to cause painful share-price declines.

,09282017,Reuters,09212017,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp vastly expanded its presence in Brazil on Wednesday, winning 10 blocks in the country’s 14th round of bidding for oil exploration and production rights, helping the cash-strapped nation fetch a record 3.8 billion reais ($1.19 billion). Exxon Mobil took six blocks in consortia with state-controlled oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro in the promising offshore Campos basin, after bidding 2.24 billion reais for one block. That was Brazil’s highest-ever such bid. The U.S. company prior to the auction was among the few oil majors without a presence in the exploration of the recently discovered large offshore fields in Brazil. Exxon Mobil also bought two blocks that it will operate on its own in the Campos basin, which abuts Brazil’s pre-salt area where hydrocarbons are trapped under a layer of salt below the ocean floor. It won a further two blocks in the Sergipe-Alagoas basin that it will develop with Queiroz Galvão Exploração e Produção (QGEP) and Murphy Oil Corp. The results came as a surprise after Brazil’s oil regulator ANP managed to sell just one of 76 blocks on offer in the highly productive Santos basin by late morning. Analysts had said lackluster oil price performance and dwindling cash for investments might have dented appetite. But Exxon Mobil, which also made a record bid of 1.2 billion reais with Petrobras for a Campos block on Wednesday, helped Brazil achieve the record take. Exxon said in a statement that it was looking forward to working with the Brazilian government and other partners in operating the blocks they won.Asked after the auction why he spent so much on the bids, Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente said he had information suggesting the blocks were part of the pre-salt area, one of the world’s largest oil discoveries in recent decades. The auction was seen as a test of whether market-friendly reforms under President Michel Temer could tempt investors back to a sector struggling after years of state meddling and tarnished by a corruption scandal at Petrobras. In the last round, in December 2015, ANP raised just 121 million reais, as tough local content rules under Temer’s predecessor Dilma Rousseff discouraged major foreign companies from investing. Brazil on Wednesday sold just 37 of the areas on offer. Still, the country raised well over the 1.69 billion reais ($529.85 million) it expected had it placed all 287 onshore and offshore exploration blocks. Officials had said they expected to sell up to 40 percent of the blocks. Environmental activists protested the auction and threatened to invade the Rio de Janeiro hotel where the round was taking place. They were removed after scuffling with hotel security staff. Other winners included China’s CNOOC and Spain’s Repsol which took offshore blocks in the Espírito Santo basin with signing bonuses for 23.55 million reais ($7.38 million) and 23 million reais respectively. The auction was Brazil’s 14th round for blocks outside of the coveted pre-salt area and should gauge appetite for the country’s second and third pre-salt rounds next month. ","

Alan Farley,09282017,Investopedia,09212017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil contract has jumped to a four-month high above $50, lifting the broad swath of underperforming energy stocks to weekly and multi-month highs. Refiners and marketers are leading the advance, with several components ready to challenge their 2014 and 2015 rally highs. However, not all components have benefited equally from this uptick, as evidenced by Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), which is underperforming Dow rival Chevron Corporation (CVX) by a wide margin. The VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK) offers a partial industry view. The ETF came public in August 2015, months after the sector topped out, and fell into a downtrend. It broke out above 13-month resistance at $20.70 in December 2016 and entered a strong advance that has posted a series of new highs in the first three quarters of 2017. Buying intensity surged at the end of August, with two monster hurricanes providing the catalyst for much higher volatility levels. (See also: Refiners ETF Hits New 52-Week High.) Chevron Corporation (CVX) entered a strong uptrend following the 2008 economic collapse, breaking out to a new high in 2011 ahead of continued gains into the July 2014 all-time high at $135.10. The subsequent decline picked up ferocity in May 2015, dumping the stock to a five-year low at $69.58 in August, ahead of a recovery wave that topped out two points below the .786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement level at $121 in December 2016. A slow and steady pullback found support near $102 in June 2017, yielding two months of testing at that level, followed by a bounce that has almost reached last year's high. A breakout would set off a number of buying signals that favor a quick surge into the 2014 high. Market players can buy that rally, taking an aggressive exit at resistance or holding on tight in anticipation of a larger-scale breakout that posts all-time highs. (For more, see: Behind Chevron's 71% Rise in 10 Years.) Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) topped out at an all-time high above $78 in July 2007 following a multi-year uptrend and sold off to $13.94 during the bear market. The stock has spent the past eight years working its way back to the prior decade's peak, stalling within five points of that level in November 2015 and dropping into a volatile correction that ended at an 18-month low in the upper $40s in June 2016. A bounce into January 2017 stalled within four points of the 2015 high, giving way to a decline that found support at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in June. It surged higher off that low, mounting the January high and finally reaching the 2015 high, which is now being tested. A breakout should allow the stock to complete the round trip into the 2007 high, while completing the final stage of a massive cup and handle breakout pattern that targets the triple digits. (See also: Valero Energy to Process More Crude Amid Strong Gasoline Demand.) Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) came public at $19.00 in June 2011 and entered a choppy sideways pattern, ahead of a September 2012 breakout that unfolded in a volatile uptrend. The stock topped out at $60.38 in July 2015, built a double top at that level and broke down in January 2016, dumping to a three-year low at $29.24 in February. A rapid recovery off that low stalled within six points of 2015 resistance in January 2017. A pullback into the second quarter found willing buyers in the upper $40s, while a bounce into August reversed just two points above the January high. Subsequent selling pressure dried up at range support and the 200-day EMA a few weeks later, yielding a fresh rally attempt that is now setting its sights on the third quarter high. Meanwhile, on-balance volume (OBV) has lifted to an all-time high, raising the odds for a multi-year breakout that targets the $80s.

"Travis Hoium, Rich Smith, and Dan Caplinger",09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. At The Motley Fool, we're all about long-term investing. We love stocks that have the potential to create value through growth or dividends years and decades into the future. We asked three of our investors which companies are built to last for the very, very long term -- 50 years -- and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) were at the top of the list. Image source: Getty Images. Rich Smith (ExxonMobil): As I specialize in space investing, I spend a lot of time thinking (way) outside the box. So when I tell you that I think ExxonMobil is a stock worth considering as an investment for the next 50 years, I hope you'll bear with me for a moment. There's been a lot of talk lately about mining the Moon for helium, for example, and digging deep into Mars in search of buried water reserves. Farther down the road, expeditions to the Jovian moons of Europa or Ganymede might require mining deep below the moons' icy surfaces, through subsurface oceans and into the seafloor below. Now, what company comes to mind when you think of digging in icy terrain and drilling beneath oceans? To me, the first name that pops is Siberian and deep-sea driller ExxonMobil. That's why I have a strong suspicion that even if Earth's oil resources are ultimately tapped out (or rendered obsolete by electric cars), there's a future for ExxonMobil stock -- out there among the stars. Travis Hoium (Alphabet): The next 50 years will likely see even more disruption than the last 50 years, so I want to own companies that have disruptive innovation built into their DNA. Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, pushing to profoundly change everything from transportation to healthcare. Alphabet's core is the Google search and advertising business that's around us every day. Google touches nearly every corner of the internet and even powers the smartphones hundreds of millions of people have in their pockets. And its base is an incredibly profitable free cash flow machine: GOOG Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. On top of the steady moneymaking business is a company that invests in nearly every revolutionary technology being developed today. Waymo is developing self-driving vehicles, Nest is making smart thermostats and security systems, Google Fiber and Project Loon are bringing high-speed internet to the world, and Google's investment arms have stakes in companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Slack. Not all of these bets will pay off, but the ones that do could drive the next generation of growth for Alphabet. In a fairly short period of time as a public company (a little over a decade), Alphabet has shown the ability to grow its core business and adapt to new technologies that will shape the world for decades to come. Few companies are prepared for the next phase of transformative innovation like Alphabet is. No matter what the world looks like in 50 years, I bet Alphabet will play a big role in the technology we use every day. Dan Caplinger (NVR): The population of the U.S. continues to rise, and demand for housing remains strong. NVR is just one of many homebuilders in the stock market, but the company uses an unusual business model that has given it the ability to weather difficulties in the industry that other homebuilders have suffered from more extensively. NVR's competitive edge comes largely from the way it secures land for development. Many developers choose to buy land outright well in advance of building homes on it; that not only requires them to put up a lot of money up front but also leaves them exposed to downturns in the real estate market. Instead, NVR obtains options to purchase land at a future date, exercising its rights on a lot-by-lot basis, in many instances just before making a sale. The strategy does require NVR to spend extra money to secure the options to purchase, but if something happens with the real estate market, the company can simply walk away without exercising the option, limiting its losses to the amount it paid for the option. In the eight years since the financial crisis, NVR has seen its profits quadruple, and investors are excited about the future. Whether the housing market thrives or slides, NVR is in one of the best positions possible to deliver strong returns to its shareholders. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Hold for the Next 50 Years -- The Motley Fool

Reuben Gregg Brewer,09282017,Fool,09212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Investing in a high-yield stock isn't worth it if the dividend winds up getting cut. The fat yield, in that case, was little more than an illusion. The energy industry has been plagued by this phenomenon in recent years, as exemplified by Kinder Morgan's 75% 2016 dividend cut or ENI's nearly 30% cut in 2015. But there are no magic tricks taking place at 6.4%-yielding Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) or 3.8%-yielding ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). They are two of the safest high-yield dividends stocks in the energy space backed by long, and still intact, annual dividend growth streaks. Enterprise, an oil and natural gas midstream limited partnership, sports the higher yield of this pair. That's not surprising since the partnership structure is specifically designed to pass income through to unitholders. But it's worth noting that the 6.4% yield is backed by 20 consecutive years' worth of distribution increases, with an average annual increase of about 5%. So it has both an impressive yield and an impressive record of slow and steady distribution growth. Image source: Getty Images. Enterprise is one of the largest and most diversified midstream players. It is continuing to invest for the future, with roughly $9 billion in growth investments in the works right now. That will help the partnership keep increasing the distribution in the years ahead. And Enterprise is conservatively run, with distribution coverage of 1.2 times providing a nice margin of safety for yield seekers. But one of the most exciting pieces of data here is that, even during the worst of the oil downturn that started in mid-2014, Enterprise's core distributable cash flow continued to head slowly higher. In other words, it was able to keep growing its largely fee-based business right through an energy industry rough patch while rewarding unitholders with distribution increases and solid distribution coverage of at least 1.2 times. If you're looking for a high and safe yield, you need to put Enterprise on your list -- even if you aren't focused on the energy patch. Another energy company you should be looking at for a safe high yield is integrated energy major ExxonMobil. The company has increased its dividend for an incredible 35 years despite operating in a commodity business prone to volatile price swings. The average annualized increase over the past decade was nearly 9%, around three times the historical rate of inflation growth. That said, it didn't sail through the recent oil downturn nearly as well as Enterprise. But that's actually one of the reasons to like Exxon more than its integrated energy peers, most of which have higher leverage ratios. XOM Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly) data by YCharts. When oil prices started to collapse in mid-2014, Exxon's top and bottom lines took a big hit. But it continued to invest in its business and increase the dividend anyway. It did that by cutting costs and adding leverage to its balance sheet (cost-cutting and increasing debt was the basic tactic for all the energy majors). But here's the interesting thing: Despite long-term debt increasing from roughly $7 billion in 2013 to nearly $29 billion in 2016, Exxon is still one of the least-leveraged oil majors. Basically it , sed its strong balance sheet to power through the energy downturn, which is exactly what you want to see. The key, however, is that even after all that additional leverage, long-term debt still only makes up about 12% of the capital structure -- an industry-leading metric. EPD Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts. The improving energy market, meanwhile, has allowed Exxon to again cover its dividend and capital spending plans, and given it enough breathing room to pay down $4 billion in long-term debt through the first half of the year. There are integrated oil majors with higher yields, but none stacks up to Exxon's financial strength and dividend history. You can find energy companies with yields higher than Enterprise or Exxon relatively easily. But the mix of dividend safety and high yield that each of these industry giants offers is a lot harder to come by. Both have proven their mettle and commitment to investors through long, uninterrupted streaks of annual dividend increases and their astute management through the recent, and deep, oil downturn. And with Enterprise and Exxon both offering relatively high yields today, these stocks could be prime portfolio candidates if you're looking for safe, high-yield dividend investments. ","

",Why it pays to take a second look at this year’s worst-performing Dividend Aristocrat stocks - MarketWatch
,10052017,Reuters,09282017,"RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s big bet on Brazil’s offshore Campos basin shows its willingness to pay up to replenish its reserves and may pave the way for hefty bids in October auctions in the country’s rich pre-salt areas, analysts said. Marking a return to Brazilian exploration after a five-year absence, Exxon took eight blocks in the coveted basin, one of Brazil’s most productive, at an auction on Wednesday. Six were taken in partnership with state-run Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras). The auction’s record take included an Exxon bid of 2.24 billion reais ($704 million) for one block, Brazil’s highest-ever such bid. That showed how oil companies that can afford significant overheads are willing to shell out for and develop high quality reserves in far-flung locations, despite oil prices that have roughly halved since 2014. “If anyone can bring a low-cost approach to doing something as big and complex as that, it is probably Exxon Mobil,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones. Youngberg said he also expects Exxon to be involved in October auctions of blocks in the adjoining pre-salt area, where hydrocarbons are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor. Exxon did not immediately respond to a question about its potential participation in the October auctions. Exxon, with a market value of around $350 billion, has spent heavily this year on oil and natural gas expansion projects to replenish its diminishing reserves, seeking to counteract concerns that it is falling behind peers in exploration and production. Investments have included the Permian Basin in the United States, offshore Guyana, and Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale play. The Brazil deal is a “further sign of the company’s urgency to replenish its resources base,” analysts at Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co said on Thursday, adding that the Campos Basin deal was a bullish sign for Brazil’s pre-salt block auctions. Wednesday’s record bid was around 5 times as much as the nearest one from Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol. Petrobras said it had information that some of the Campos blocks had high-potential pre-salt reserves. Before the auction, Exxon was among the few oil majors without an exploration presence in Brazil’s recently discovered large offshore fields. “For Exxon Mobil, a lack of presence in Brazil’s pre-salt has been arguably the biggest gap in its portfolio, especially now that Shell holds a dominant position in this prolific, relatively low-breakeven play,” Horacio Cuenca, a researcher at Wood Mackenzie, said in a client statement. Exxon abandoned drilling efforts in the nearby Santos basin in 2012 following disappointing results. But a series of policy changes under market-friendly President Michel Temer, including a reduction of requirements that forced foreign businesses to use local partners, will likely tempt investors to return to Latin America’s no.1 economy, analysts said.

 ,10052017,CNBC,09282017,"Oil prices fell about 3 percent on Friday, as a week of profit-taking and the return of oversupply concerns led the market lower, snapping a multi-week bull run. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 2.95 percent, settling at $49.29, breaking a four week win streak. It closed down nearly 4.5 percent in the worst performing week since March 10. The prospect of extended oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia had supported prices on Thursday. But on Friday Russia clarified remarks on the oil market made by President Vladimir Putin earlier this week, saying he did not propose extending a global oil output cut deal but said he recognized it was a possibility. ""Yesterday we had Russia and the Saudis talking about extending cooperation, and today we saw a little bit of backtracking with respect to additional cuts in production."" said Houston-based consultant Andrew Lipow. ""What the market gained yesterday is clearly being given back today."" Saudi Arabia's energy minister said on Thursday he was ""flexible"" about prolonging the production-curbing pact until the end of 2018. However, concerns linger about growing U.S. crude exports, incentivised by a hefty WTI discount to Brent prices. ""We have a couple of bearish factors like a new record for U.S. crude exports, the reopening of Libya's biggest oilfield, a new year high in U.S. crude production and the recent strength of the U.S. dollar,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW in Stuttgart. A stronger dollar also led to further losses in the oil market on Friday. The dollar hit a 10-week high after data showing the largest gain in U.S. wages since December 2016 bolstered bets on an interest rate hike by year-end. ""I expect Brent to drop below $55 a barrel and WTI below $50 in the next couple of days,"" Schallenberger said. U.S. government data showed this week that crude exports had risen to a record of nearly 2 million barrels per day. Analysts told CNBC they expect the export levels to remain elevated in the coming weeks. Futures held their losses after oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported the number of oil rigs operating in U.S. fields fell by 2 in the latest week. The rig count stood at 748, compared with 428 at this time last year. Investors were watching tropical storm Nate's impact on some oil production in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of its expected arrival in the area as a hurricane on Sunday. ""The biggest impact (from Nate) could be on gasoline prices, depending on how many refineries are forced to shut down. But I don't think we will see another bull run,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW in Stuttgart. In the Gulf of Mexico, BP and Chevron were shutting production at all platforms, while Royal Dutch Shell and Anadarko Petroleum suspended some activity. Exxon Mobil, Statoil and other producers have withdrawn personnel. ",Oil set to end multi-week bull run as oversupply concerns resurface

Reuben Gregg Brewer,10052017,Fool,09282017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Oil prices peaked at over $100 a barrel in mid-2014 and then fell sharply to around $30 a barrel in January of 2016. Although prices have rebounded since that low, they remain range bound at about half the previous highs. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has rolled with the punches, though, continuing to reward shareholders with annual dividend hikes. That's a testament to its conservative culture and diversified business. If volatile energy prices have you wondering how risky ExxonMobil is, well, here are some key facts you'll want to know. Exxon is an integrated energy company. That means it has operations across the industry, including drilling, refining, and chemicals. This is notable because oil prices affect each of these business differently. Specifically, downstream businesses like refining and chemicals can actually benefit from lower input costs (essentially falling oil prices). Image source: Getty Images. This dynamic was on clear display in 2015 when the drilling business saw earnings decline roughly 75% as oil prices fell. That same year, though, earnings in the downstream businesses more than doubled, largely because oil prices were declining. The improvement in the downstream business' earnings wasn't enough to offset all of the pain from falling oil prices, but it certainly helped to soften the blow. Exxon isn't the only energy company with a mix of upstream and downstream assets. But this diversification sets the stage for a very stable business. The next important fact is that Exxon is one of the least leveraged energy majors. That said, if you read the news, you'll know that Exxon added a lot of debt during the energy downturn. There's no denying that fact; between 2013 and 2016, long-term debt increased from roughly $7 billion to almost $29 billion. That's a massive increase. XOM Financial Debt to Equity (Quarterly) data by YCharts. But step back for a second. During the downturn, all of the energy majors cut costs and added debt to support their businesses. Exxon was no different in this regard. However, Exxon happens to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with debt making up only about 15% of its capital structure at the end of 2016, even after adding all of that debt. And Exxon is already starting to pay its debt off, cutting long-term debt by over $4 billion through the first six months of 2017. The thing is, this is exactly what you want to see management do -- use its rock-solid balance sheet to smooth out the ups and downs of the volatile energy industry. Clearly, adding that much debt isn't good, but the fact that Exxon has the flexibility to do so is a very good thing. The last fact up is Exxon's dividend, which has been increased every year for 35 consecutive years. That's a streak unrivaled in the volatile energy business and shows that Exxon believes in rewarding shareholders in good years and bad. But there's a little more to this story, too. For example, you can argue that Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) has an equally impressive streak of 29 years going. But during the oil downturn, Chevron's dividend stood at $1.07 a share for 10 consecutive quarters. That's two and a half years. The annual increase streak only stayed alive because Chevron traditionally increases its dividend in the middle of the year. In other words, it was a timing issue. (Some of the other oil majors ended up cutting their dividends, by the way.) XOM Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Exxon actually increased its dividend every single year. This doesn't necessarily make the business any safer, but it certainly makes it easier for investors to stick around through the hard times. The oil and natural gas business is an inherently volatile one, driven by often swift and dramatic commodity price moves. That's not likely to change anytime soon. However, Exxon's diversified business helps to offset that volatility as some divisions will benefit when others are likely to be suffering. That's layered on top of a balance sheet that provides a foundation solid enough to weather even the strongest gales. And investors, like me, get to benefit as the company continues to reward us with a steadily rising dividend -- a statement that management believes this company is set to thrive in any market. How risky is ExxonMobil? Not nearly as risky as you might think for a company in the oil business. ","

Jeffry Bartash,10052017,MarketWatch,09282017,"Published: Oct 4, 2017 3:25 p.m. ET Secretary of state has clashed with Trump over key issues By U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted he and President Donald Trump are on the same page on foreign policy, but he did not deny calling the president a “moron,” as NBC News had reported, at a Pentagon meeting in July. In a previously unscheduled public appearance Wednesday, Tillerson called Trump “smart” and said he had never talked out of resigning because of disagreements with the president. NBC reported that a frustrated Tillerson called Trump a “moron” in a meeting with Pentagon officials in mid-July. He was also supposedly talked out of resigning by Vice President Mike Pence. To quell a budding controversy, Tillerson interrupted his schedule to make a short statement to the media. He denied the NBC report about Pence, but he declined to address whether he called Trump a “moron.” Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp.

The administration was beset by resignations and firings at the time, and officials were concerned about potential fallout from the departure of such a high-level cabinet member in the first year of Trump’s presidency. Tensions appeared to be reignited last weekend when Tillerson said the U.S. was attempting to find a diplomatic solution to the armed standoff with North Korea.

                                   has been dethroned as the world’s top energy company, according to the 2017 S&P Global Platts rankings. Charles Hugh Smith, in a post on the Daily Reckoning blog, used this troubling chart to explain how “the Achilles Heel of our socio-economic system is the secular stagnation of earned income, i.e. wages and salaries.” As you can see, there’s been a long and steady decline: “Stagnating wages undermine every aspect of our economy: consumption, credit, taxation and perhaps most importantly, the unspoken social contract that the benefits of productivity and increasing wealth will be distributed widely, if not fairly,” Hugh Smith writes. He explains that, given the gravity of the consequences of the trend, economists have been trying to figure it out. They have been citing factors such as automation, globalization/offshoring, the high cost of housing, a decline of corporate competition, a failure of our educational complex to keep pace, stagnating gains in productivity, and so on. “Each of these dynamics may well exacerbate the trend,” Hugh Smith says, “but they all dodge the dominant driver of wage stagnation and rise income-wealth inequality: Our economy is optimized for financialization, not labor/earned income.” He put the blame squarely on the Fed. “Pushing inflation higher while wages stagnate can be charitably called insane,” he writes. “Less charitably, it’s evil, as it strips purchasing power and wealth from all whose income isn’t keeping pace with central bank-engineered inflation.” “You can’t survive a market crash if you think it can’t happen” — Jason Zweig, in his WSJ piece, “Will you be ready when the stock market crashes again?” The number everybody will be focusing on this week is the September jobs report, as hurricanes could make it look like the U.S. lost jobs for the first time since 2010. But that doesn’t hit until Friday. In the meantime, we’ll get construction spending for August at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Monday. Also of note, Tuesday will bring car sales for September, with analysts expecting a nice little bump from August. 17.9% — That’s how much NFL ticket sales have dropped from the prior week amid the knee-taking anthem protests, according to the Washington Examiner. “We have seen a massive decrease in NFL ticket purchases this past week in comparison to years past,” TickPick’s Jack Slingland said.

Rebecca Ungarino,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Boeing is running into trouble this week and now faces a critical technical test, according to one technician.

Tom DiChristopher,10262017,CNBC,10192017,"Saudi Aramco's plan to take a portion of its business public next year remains on track, the oil giant's chief executive Amin Nasser told CNBC in an exclusive interview. Nasser made his comments Sunday following recent reports that the initial public offering for the world's largest energy company could be delayed into 2019 or shelved in favor of selling private shares to sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Aramco has tried to swat down those rumors, and Nasser denied the reports again in an interview with ""Squawk Box""in the command center at Saudi Aramco headquarters in Dhahran. ""We have always said that we will be listing in 2018, and to be more specific, in the second half of 2018,"" he said. ""However, I think journalists and writers — they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the IPO and all of that."" ""The IPO is on track. The listing venue will be discussed and shared in due course,"" Nasser added. Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, plans to list its shares on the Saudi domestic stock market, the Tadawul, and one or more foreign exchanges. However, it has yet to choose the overseas market, fueling speculation about the kingdom's plans. The Financial Times reported last month that China was emerging as a front-runner in the possible plan to delay the IPO and sell shares to sovereign wealth funds. Asked directly about the report, Nasser denied it. ""Saudi Aramco are not talking, as I said, to the Chinese or others,"" he said. ""All of that analysis is being reviewed in detail ... to make a decision at a certain stage, and we're not going to be pushed, you know, by a journalist saying this needs to be talked about or not."" The IPO for roughly 5 percent of the company is widely expected to be the largest in history. Saudi officials have said Aramco could attract a $2 trillion valuation, though others forecast the offering will value the company at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. In any case, investment banks tapped to handle the transaction stand to reap a huge windfall. The share sale is also critical to Saudi Arabia's economic future. The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's efforts to diversify the nation's economy through a plan called ""Vision 2030."" Nasser believes Saudi Aramco is at the heart of that plan and the kingdom's transformation. He said the IPO will facilitate key initiatives to grow private business' share of the economy, create more small- and medium-sized enterprises, boost industrialization and employment and encourage women to join the workforce. Some fund managers recently told CNBC their concerns about the IPO include minority shareholder rights, the transparency of oil reserves, the viability of fossil fuels and how the Saudis will balance national priorities and their duty to shareholders. Saudi oil revenues have historically funded its social spending, a critical aspect of its pact to provide for its citizens and its large royal family. That pact is seen as the key to maintaining relative stability in a region rocked by social upheaval in recent years. Nasser predicted it will be easy to convey to investors how Saudi Aramco's focus on long-term planning has allowed the company to drive past results. He believes the interests of its sole current shareholder — the government — and its future investors are aligned. ""I think both are looking for results,"" he said. ""Both are going to be looking for a better performance, and I don't see any issues between our current shareholder and the public that will be participating when we are listed because ultimately we need to deliver better results."" Nasser also addressed the issue of transparency. Some investors have questioned Saudi oil reserves, which have remained roughly constant at about 260 billion to 265 billion barrels since 1989. Saudi Aramco has kept up a robust exploration program, even through the three-year oil price downturn, allowing it to add to its reserves, according to Nasser. He promised that Saudi Aramco will ""meet all the requirements of that market in terms of reserve assessment"" and other rules of the country where it chooses to list. Ultimately, Saudi Arabia is largely operating in line with its closest peers, the integrated international oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP, Nasser said. ""I can say Aramco has always been run like a publicly traded company,"" he said. ""If you look at our governance, we have independent board members. Everything that has been done in the company is similar to any international oil company in terms of the way we do business."" Iran needs economic ties to the rest of the world as the Trump administration plans sanctions on Iranian oil exports starting in November. For Iran one nation matters more than any other, and it is Trump's largest global trade rival: China. China has powerful non-tariff measures it can use to crush America  from cashing out its $1 trillion hoard of U.S. Treasury bonds to devaluing the yuan. These are measures that could destabilize the U.S. economy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has one big weakness in his master plan to dominate the world stage: an aging oil economy that lacks innovation and globally competitive sectors.

Income investors who take a quick look at Royal Dutch Shell plc's (NYSE:RDS-B) 6% dividend yield might be tempted to think it offers a better value than ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) with its 3.7% yield. There are good things taking shape at each of these integrated oil majors -- but when you look past the dividend yield, Exxon appears to be the better value. Here's why. During the worst of the oil downturn that started in mid-2014, Shell agreed to acquire BG Group. That move, which cost roughly $50 billion, helped increase the company's debt level by over 50% in 2016. Investors were clearly concerned, pushing shares down to the lowest price to tangible book value ratio they had seen in a decade at the start of 2017. Image source: Getty Images But Shell has been working quickly to reduce that debt, having already agreed to or completed the sale of $25 billion worth of assets (out of a $30 billion target). And its return on invested capital, which has been hampered over the years by large profile misses like arctic drilling, has started to move higher too. Management believes it can get that number up to 10%, even if oil prices are in the $60 a barrel range. That's a higher return than Shell managed between 2013 and 2016, when oil averaged $90 a barrel. Add in oil prices that have solidified in the $50 a barrel range and investor concerns about Shell appear to have waned. The company's price to tangible book value is back up toward the top of the range it has traded in for most of the past decade. I wouldn't call it expensive, per se, but it appears to be fairly valued at present. Bottom line: investors have clearly already rewarded Shell for the improvements it's made. Then there's Exxon, which, despite the lower yield, could offer income investors a better value proposition. This energy giant's price to tangible book value, for example, is up from its lows but still near the lowest levels of the past decade. That might make you think that Exxon is struggling to deal with headwinds that Shell has easily surmounted. But that's not the case. XOM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts For example, Exxon took on debt during the downturn to support its dividend and capital spending, as most oil majors did. However, it didn't take on a giant acquisition like Shell. Repairing the balance sheet, which remains quite strong despite the added leverage, isn't as worrying an issue. Meanwhile, Exxon has long been an industry leader when it comes to return on invested capital. It has proven year in and year out that it is among the best-run oil companies in the world. Yes, returns took a hit during the energy downturn, but like Shell they are starting to turn higher again. Note in the graph below that Exxon's returns remain higher than Shell's even today. RDS.B Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts And then there's the future. Exxon has two sizable catalysts for production growth:  the Permian Basin in the United States and an offshore field in Guyana. These opportunities don't appear to be priced into Exxon's valuation today. Exxon's yield may be materially lower than Shell's, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Exxon has long been one of the best operators in the oil business, has a solid balance sheet, and has notable production growth opportunities ahead of it. But investors remain unimpressed. Meanwhile, investors have rewarded Shell for its efforts to dig itself out of a balance sheet hole and for improving its lagging capital investment results. That's not to suggest that Shell is a bad company or even a bad investment: if you are searching for a high yield, it appears fairly valued today. But if you want a high yield and a good value, Exxon looks like the better opportunity right now. ","
      
    2 Reasons Exxon Mobil Corporation Is a Better Value Stock than Royal Dutch Shell plc -- The Motley Fool

Philip van Doorn,10262017,MarketWatch,10192017,"Published: Oct 26, 2017 3:46 p.m. ET A measure called return on corporate capital is revealing — and there’s a free investor tool for research By Ever since stocks were first bought and sold, investors have sought to find company metrics that would separate the winners from the losers. Sales growth, earnings growth, earnings per share — even CEO pay. Now it turns out that companies that are good at deploying capital to produce quality goods and services represent lower risk and a higher likelihood of long-term stock gains. We examined this phenomenon two years ago, tying high returns on invested capital (ROIC) to excellent stock performance over very long periods. The data were provided by FactSet, which defines ROIC as a company’s net income divided by total invested capital (total shareholders’ equity and long-term debt). The idea of ROIC is to measure how efficiently a company’s managers use the money they have raised. At that time, Gary Lutin, a former investment banker at Lutin & Co. who oversees the Shareholder Forum in New York, said long-term investors who wanted to invest some of their money in individual stocks also needed to think about the products and services being sold by the companies and consider whether they would remain competitive for up to 20 years. Lutin & Co. invests only in non-publicly-traded companies, so as not to interfere with Lutin’s work at the Shareholder Forum, which works to provide “fair access to information that can be relied upon by both corporate and investor decision-makers,” and receives financial support from professional investors. Free data The Shareholder Forum on Oct. 20 rolled out a new calculation called return on corporate capital (ROCC). That can be useful for investors because the data are available for free and are calculated in a uniform manner using GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) data from SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) filings. Definitions of ROIC vary, and some companies even calculate ROIC using adjusted earnings numbers. But ROCC is calculated the same way for every company, using annual data: Net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. The idea is that if a company consistently generates high returns on corporate capital, good things will eventually happen. A focus on the company’s main business, rather than financial engineering through share buybacks or on adjusted earnings figures, means real profits are rolling in at high levels relative to investment. That eventually can be expected to support higher share prices, as the profits feed organic expansion, acquisitions or other things that are good for shareholders. The example of Valeant Evan Tindell, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bireme Capital, said ROCC enables investors to “look at the absolutely unadjusted figures.” He cited Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

                                   as a company that “consistently” focuses on adjusted figures in its earnings releases. For example, Valeant reported a GAAP net loss of $38 million for the second quarter, but adjusted earnings of $362 million, after making adjustments for amortization, asset impairments restructuring and other times. Wall Street analysts’ estimates are based on projected adjusted earnings per share. Valeant’s average ROCC over the past five fiscal years has been 1.8%, compared with 8.7% for its industry group, according the “real” GAAP numbers used by the Shareholder Forum. In an interview on Oct. 17, Lutin pointed out that ROCC comparisons are a sound foundation for analysis but should be considered only the starting point. Some companies, such as Amazon.com Inc.

That looks like a low figure, but for investors, the Amazon story has been about rapid sales growth, dominance in internet retail and expansion into new areas of business. The low ROCC and the stock’s high price-to-earnings ratio — 125.7 times consensus 2018 earnings estimates — may mean this type of valuation will eventually become unsustainable.

                                   for example, you can see the company’s average ROCC is 26.2%. The ROCC tool uses Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) from companies’ SEC filings to determine industry groups. These company-specified classifications are not always the best reflection of their current business, so you may have to make your own comparisons of companies in similar industries. For example, with 3M, you can see its ROCC greatly exceeds that of its industry group. The problem is that the industry group is “surgical and medical instruments,” when this industry represents only one of 3M’s five industry groups. If we look at the S&P 500’s industrial sector, there are seven companies that FactSet classifies as industrial conglomerates. Here are the five-year average ROCC figures for the group, along with their five-year total returns: You can see that for this industry group, the one with the best ROCC over the past five years didn’t have the best total return.

John Maynard Keynes famously described the stock market as a beauty contest in his 1936 book, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” to explain price fluctuations in equity markets. What he meant was that investors were trying to determine which stocks would be most attractive to other investors. “Speculating on what other people will find beautiful is a fool’s game,” Lutin said. “It’s a lot easier, and a whole lot safer, to pick a company that generates good returns by producing goods and services. A sound business foundation is also likely to continue its value a lot longer than today’s beauty.” Here are five-year average returns on corporate capital for the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average

A whopping 87.61, which is higher than 99.999% of all readings going back to 1900, according to Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners. In fact, only eight trading days since then (out of 30,914) have registered a higher reading on the blue-chip index. As if you needed another, but this sounds like a good reason to bail. Bilello, in our call of the day, says, however, if you sold every other time the RSI hit such an excessive number, you’d have missed out on some solid returns. At least over the short term. “In the year following extreme overbought readings, the Dow has actually been higher roughly 70% of the time, with an average price return of 14.2%,” Bilello explains in a blog post. “From five days forward through one year forward, the average returns and odds of a positive returns are higher than any random day.” Of course, he pointed out that these are just historical trends — trends that will almost certainly reverse the minute you decide to follow them. That’s the rub of timing the market. Still, the next time somebody tells you how risky and overbought this stock market is, go ahead and shove this graphic in their face: “If one is going to predict anything based on extreme overbought conditions (and I would advise against doing so), it would be further gains,” Bilello says. “I realize that doesn’t conform to the conventional narrative of ‘overbought = bearish,’ but the truth in markets rarely does.” Today’s truth: More record highs?

We can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop” — economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek. He said those words back long before cryptocurrencies were a thing, but bitcoin fans recently trotted that out on Reddit as their investment continues to push deeper and deeper into record territory. See:  A bigger blast-off? What one strategist sees taking bitcoin ‘into the stratosphere’ And check out: The ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ says ICOs are ‘the biggest scam ever’ This chart “shows the power of human ingenuity, the benefits of long-term optimism, innovation, and progress in the business world,” says Ben Carlson of the Wealth of Common Sense blog. It also shows how the 22% implosion of the 1987 crash, which turned 30 years old last week, is nothing more than a hiccup in the long-term. “The standard lesson most investors try to show from all of this is that thinking long-term and ignoring the noise means everything will work out just fine,” Carlson says. “This is generally good advice but it’s also extremely naive.” Naive in that actually living through such drawdowns is completely different than reading about them ... or observing them in a chart. It can have a debilitating impact on how you navigate markets. “I’m still not sold on the idea that those who did experience the 1987 crash are better investors for it,” Carlson writes. “Some people who go through this type of market turbulence are always waiting for it to happen again. I’ve seen plenty of this following the 2008 financial crisis. Experience can help in the markets, but it can also work against you when you’re constantly fighting the last war.” Read: 3 money managers who lived through the 1987 stock-market crash warn of danger today Tesla

,11022017,Investopedia,10262017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. The model for MLR, given n observations, is: yi = B0 + B1xi1 + B2xi2 + ... + Bpxip + E where i = 1,2, ..., n A simple linear regression is a function that allows an analyst or statistician to make predictions about one variable based on the information that is known about another variable. Linear regression can only be used when one has two continuous variables – an independent variable and a dependent variable. The independent variable is the parameter that is used to calculate the dependent variable or outcome. For example, an analyst may want to know how the movement of the market affects the price of Exxon Mobil (XOM). In this case, his linear equation will have the value of S&P 500 index as the independent variable or predictor, and the price of XOM as the dependent variable. In reality, there are multiple factors that predict the outcome of an event. The price movement of Exxon Mobil, for example, depends on more than just the performance of the overall market. Other predictors such as the price of oil, interest rates, and the price movement of oil futures can affect the price of XOM and stock prices of other oil companies. To understand a relationship in which more than two variables are present, a multiple linear regression is used. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to determine a mathematical relationship among a number of random variables. In other terms, MLR examines how multiple independent variables are related to one dependent variable. Once each of the independent factors have been determined to predict the dependent variable, the information on the multiple variables can be used to create an accurate prediction on the level of effect they have on the outcome variable. The model creates a relationship in the form of a straight line (linear) that best approximates all the individual data points. The model for multiple linear regression is: yi = B0 + B1xi1 + B2xi2 + ... + Bpxip + E Where yi = dependent variable - price of XOM xi1 = independent variable – interest rates xi2 = independent variable – oil price xi3 = independent variable – value of S&P 500 index xi4= independent variable – price of oil futures E = random error in prediction, that is variance that cannot be accurately predicted by the model. Also known as residuals. B0 = y-intercept at time zero. B1 = regression coefficient that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi1 changes – change in XOM price when interest rates change B2 = coefficient value that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi2 changes – change in XOM price when oil prices change Etc. The least squares estimates, B0, B1, B2…Bp are usually computed by statistical software. As many variables can be included in the regression model in which each independent variable is differentiated with a number - 1,2, 3, 4...p. The multiple regression model allows an analyst to predict an outcome based on information provided on multiple explanatory variables. Still, the model is not always perfectly accurate as each data point can differ slightly from the outcome predicted by the model. The residual value, E, which is the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome, is included in the model to account for such slight variations. The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions: The co-efficient of determination, R-squared or R2, is a statistical metric that is used to measure how much of the variation in outcome can be explained by the variation in the independent variables. R2 always increases as more predictors are added to the MLR model even though the predictors may not related to the outcome variable. Therefore, R2 by itself, cannot be used to identify which predictors should be included in a model and which should be excluded. R2 can only be between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the outcome cannot be predicted by any of the independent variables and 1 indicates that the outcome can be predicted without error from the independent variables. Assuming we run our XOM price regression model through a statistics computation software that returns this output: An analyst would interpret this output to mean if other variables are held constant, the price of XOM will increase by 7.8% if the price of oil in the markets increases by 1%. The model also shows that the price of XOM will decrease by 1.5% following a 1% rise in interest rates. R2 indicates that 86.5% of the variations in the stock price of Exxon Mobil can be explained by changes in the interest rate, oil price, oil futures, and S&P 500 index.

When a company as big and diverse as General Electric (NYSE:GE) says publicly that it's considering reducing its dividend, it should give investors pause. GE was viewed as a Dividend Aristocrat for decades before the financial crisis but was working hard to get that title back. If conditions at GE are so dire that it needs to cut its dividend, then there must be other companies feeling similar pressure. The energy business isn't performing as well as GE hoped, and that should worry ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) investors as well. If you look at the company's performance over the past decade, it's becoming clear that its dividend could be in trouble, just like GE's. Image source: Getty Images. The oil business has become surprisingly difficult over the past decade as shale oil has flooded the market and OPEC has kept pumping oil and prices have remained low. Oil at $100 per barrel can be extremely profitable, but at $50, it isn't clear that many companies will make a solid return on investment. Below, I've put together a chart that shows ExxonMobil's deterioration over the past decade. Revenue and earnings are down, and return on assets has also plunged from the high teens to low single digits. XOM Revenue (TTM). Data by YCharts. Long term, I don't see how this trend won't get worse. Electric vehicles are now a very viable option for millions of consumers, and automakers are ramping up their manufacturing capacity. Even if just 10% of people start driving EVs, it'll crush oil markets. Remember, oil markets were only oversupplied by about 1% to 2% in 2014 when oil prices crashed from over $100 per barrel to the $30s. Electrifying the transportation fleet could have a much bigger impact on oil prices than that. Not only is performance deteriorating and the future looking cloudy, but ExxonMobil is already stretching itself thin on its dividend. Over the past decade, the company has been increasing its dividend, surpassing a 100% payout ratio, and taking out billions of debt in the process. XOM Dividends Paid (TTM). Data by YCharts. To put this plainly, ExxonMobil isn't generating enough net income from its normal operations to pay its growing dividend and is taking out debt to pay the current 4% yield. That's not sustainable over the long term. ExxonMobil is facing a lot of the same financial pressures as GE, and with EVs on the rise, its core oil business could be in serious trouble over the long run. With a payout ratio over 100% today, this is a dividend that I think should be cut sooner rather than later. Investors should beware buying this seemingly safe dividend stock. ","
      
    If GE Cuts Its Dividend, ExxonMobil Could Be Next -- The Motley Fool

Reuben Gregg Brewer,11022017,Fool,10262017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The plunge in oil prices that started in mid-2014 forced integrated oil and natural gas giants ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell plc (NYSE:RDS-B) to retrench. Their financial results are finally starting to stabilize now that oil has been holding steadily in the $50-per-barrel range. However, they have been left with higher debt loads and a renewed outlook that includes range-bound oil prices for years to come. Which is the best buy today? One of the hangovers from the deep oil downturn is debt. All of the oil majors added leverage to their balance sheets so they could keep paying their distributions and fund planned capital expenditures. At the midpoint of 2017, Exxon had $4 billion in cash, with debt making up roughly 12% of its capital structure. That's a rock-solid balance sheet, but it's even more impressive when you consider that Exxon's debt is over three times larger than what it was at the start of 2014. Image source: Getty Images. By comparison, Chevron had cash of around $4.7 billion at mid-year, and long-term debt made up roughly 19% of the company's capital structure. Royal Dutch Shell, meanwhile, had $24 billion in cash, and long-term debt was nearly 30% of the capital structure. All three are working to deleverage today, but Exxon clearly has the strongest finances. Exxon is also one of the best-run oil majors when you look at return on capital employed. That basically examines how well a company uses its shareholders' money. The oil downturn led to return on capital employed falling for all of these companies. They're all starting to push the metric higher again now that oil prices appear to have stabilized. But it's the long-term view that matters here. Exxon isn't always tops on this metric, but it has historically beaten Shell and Chevron. Exxon wins here as well. XOM Return on Capital Employed (TTM) data by YCharts One place where Exxon isn't a clear winner is dividend yield. Exxon's yield is 3.7% today, compared with Chevron's 3.8% and Shell's 5.9%. However, Exxon can boast a 35-year streak of annual dividend increases. Shell's dividend has been held steady since the start of 2014. And while Chevron boasts of an annual streak of 29 years with increasing dividends, it held the dividend constant for 10 quarters during the oil downturn. The 29-year streak was kept alive because of the mid-year timing of its dividend increases. If you're only interested in yield, Shell is your best bet. But if you're interested in income and regular income growth, Exxon gets the nod. The next issue to look at is valuation. The price to tangible book value for all three of these oil giants is off the lows seen during the worst of the oil downturn. However, Shell's price to tangible book value has recovered materially over the past year and is roughly at the midpoint of where it's been for most of the past decade. It's no longer cheap relative to its own history. Chevron is getting back into a more normal range as well. XOM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts Exxon's price to tangible book value, meanwhile, remains close to the lowest levels it's seen over the past 10 years. To be fair, Exxon's price to tangible book value ratio is above those of Chevron and Shell. But it has historically been higher, largely because investors consider it to be the best-run oil company. That Exxon appears cheap compared with its own history is what's noteworthy here. One again, Exxon comes out on top. Exxon, Chevron, and Shell are all well-run companies, and any one of them could be a fine addition to your portfolio. But if you're a long-term investor, Exxon looks like the best overall option today when you consider historical valuations, financial strength, management's ability to put investor cash to work, and dividends. That said, if all you care about is yield, then Shell is your best bet -- but go in knowing that you may not be getting the best value. ","

Fishing in uncharted waters Fishing among the unknown names in small-cap land certainly helps Balkin get those returns. It’s an old investing trick to look for “hidden gems.” Especially since the sell-side-analyst army got trimmed after the crackdown on Wall Street following the tech meltdown, many of the companies aren’t well-covered, if at all. So it’s easier to find hot products and trends the rest of the market hasn’t learned about. “We try to identify names that are below the radar screen,” says Balkin. “That is the art of what we do.” In contrast, big companies like Exxon Mobil

                                   have too many analysts to leave much hope that you might find something they missed. Hitting the road Next, at a time when so many investors never leave the office because they’re hunched over computers and sorting through “big data” to pick names, it’s refreshing that Balkin and his team regularly beat these “quants” by hitting the road. “We need to sit across the table from the management teams to understand how they think about their businesses and see the business in operation,” says Balkin. Meeting executives can reveal nuances about company cultures and even red flags, says co-manager Ward Sexton. “Do they have a big, shiny building with their name on it?” he says. Being housed in Taj Mahal-style headquarters can signal management hubris. Another potential sign is the corporate jet — normally not a necessity for a small company unless they have remote locations. The William Blair Small Cap Growth Fund’s managers also check to see that executive pay is aligned with shareholders. Beyond that, the fund managers look for companies growing faster than their peers, with stocks trading at reasonable valuations due to the market inefficiencies in small-cap land. Here are three examples. Yelp Granted, this publisher of crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses is hardly unknown to investors. But by Balkin’s estimates, they’re all missing something because it still looks relatively cheap. Yelp

Yelp should see continued growth as more local advertising moves online, following the trend in national advertising. Balkin also sees potential in Yelp’s “request a quote” service, which lets people use the site to ask contractors for quotes on jobs, for example. “This increases the perceived value of Yelp to the businesses and to the Yelp user,” says Balkin. Codexis This is more typical of the kind of undiscovered growth company that Balkin and his team like to hunt for.

,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - During her thirties, Kate was groped twice by a colleague, another pressed his leg against her during a meeting and a boss turned hostile after she rebuffed his advances. On some mornings, she vomited before going to work because she was so anxious about seeing a manager who made endless sexual innuendos - which eventually drove her to quit. “That guy was motivated by real contempt for women,” said Kate, 43, by phone, declining to give her surname. Kate said she did not dare speak out until her last day at the Boston firm, when she complained to human resources. Such reluctance to report sexual harassment is common, experts said, as people often fear they will not be taken seriously, be branded a complainer, get colleagues fired or lose their own jobs. While allegations of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s predatory sexual behavior have moved millions of women to share their stories of abuse on social media with the hashtag #MeToo, experts doubt there will be much change in the workplace. “In the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal, we have not been informed about any new commitments ... companies are taking to fight against sexual harassment,” said Deborah Gillis, head of Catalyst, a non-profit advocating for women in business. Only one of the 20 top Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies responded to queries from the Thomson Reuters Foundation as to whether the recent scandals had prompted them to revisit their sexual harassment policies. “Harassment, even in its most subtle forms, directly conflicts with company policy,” a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil said in emailed comments, adding that the oil producer had a zero tolerance policy toward harassment. The remainder declined to comment or did not respond. Yet sexual harassment in the workplace is ubiquitous, experts say. Between 25 to 85 percent of women reported being sexually harassed at work, a 2016 report by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found. But the federal agency, which is responsible for handling such allegations, received less than 10,000 complaints a year between 2011 and 2016. The EEOC found that employees routinely fail to report harassment because they anticipate negative reactions, such as being blamed for undermining morale or subjected to retaliation that could damage their career or personal reputation. U.S. companies’ reaction to the raging public debate about harassment has been muted. Experts said it was unlikely that corporations would take significant actions that could end a culture of silence over workplace abuse. “These scandals, if anything, are going to get organizations to dust off their copies of their (harassment) policies,” Margaret Stockdale, a professor of psychology at the Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI), said by phone. Some firms would also likely retrain employees and issue notices that sexual harassment is not tolerated, she added. Managers at Amazon and the global advertising firm Interpublic Group of Companies sent zero tolerance memos to their staff last month, according to media reports. Fidelity Investments chairman, Abigail Johnson, also sent a video message to staff about the Boston-based company’s “no tolerance” policy, after two managers accused of sexual harassment were fired. But such policies risk backfiring, said Meg Bond, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “If immediately the axe will always fall, it sounds tough. But what (research) found is that it sometimes discourages people from raising those issues,” she said. “You’re not ready to raise it in a way that is going to get somebody fired,” she said in a phone interview. Zoe Chance, an assistant professor of marketing at Yale University who has written on sexual harassment, said new approaches are necessary - but it is not clear what works. “Doing more of what companies are already doing, I don’t think will yield positive results,” she said. Up-and-coming initiatives include training bystanders to speak up when witnessing harassment, and to assess employees’ ability to treat colleagues with respect as part of their performances reviews, Bond said. Stockdale of IUPUI said programs which track acts of retaliation by those accused of harassment also appear promising in encouraging victims to speak out. Back in Boston, Kate, who told her story as part of the #MeToo movement, has modest expectations. She first went public on Twitter a year ago, when the nation was abuzz over a video showing Donald Trump brag about grabbing women by the genitals as he was running for the presidency. “I hope this isn’t a blip,” she said. “We had this identical conversation last year.” (This version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph 8) ","

The index gauges what its customers are buying and selling via their TD Ameritrade accounts and their exposure to the stock market. TD Ameritrade said that, while customers were net buyers for nine months in a row, it was from September to October that the broker saw the IMX jump close to 4% to reach the second highest reading in the history of the index. The online trading firm said that October was characterized by strong U.S. markets, positive quarterly earnings on behalf of all sorts of companies and a global economy that is strengthening. Taken together, that appeared to influence retail investors' behavior on the positive side. ""TD Ameritrade clients have continued to be net buyers and seem to be putting their money where they see opportunity,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, in a press release this week announcing the monthly reading of the IMX.

Mike Murphy,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 6, 2017 2:42 a.m. ET Investigation raises questions about Wilbur Ross, other top members of Trump administration By A massive new leak of financial data has revealed how the world’s ultra-rich move trillions of dollars through offshore tax havens, and has raised new questions about the finances of top members of the Trump administration. The leak, known as the Paradise Papers, comes more than a year after the Panama Papers, for which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing offshore banking practices of the world’s elite. 1. So what is it? The Paradise Papers contains 13.4 million leaked documents, mostly from the Bermuda-based law firm Appleby and Singapore-based Asiaciti Trust. According to Appleby’s website, it specializes in providing offshore legal services for “global public and private companies, financial institutions, and high net-worth individuals.” Asiaciti Trust says it is “an international trust and corporate services provider.” As with the Panama Papers, the leaked data was shared with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which brought it to the ICIJ, which in turn led the collaborative investigation that involved nearly 100 media partners worldwide, including the New York Times, the Guardian, the BBC and NBC News.

Most of the information involved the ways politicians, celebrities and the mega-rich protect their cash from taxes, hide ownership of major assets and conduct business in secret. Most of the practices that were exposed are legal, though in many cases may be unethical. 3. Who was exposed? According to the Paradise Papers, Wilbur Ross, the U.S commerce secretary, was found to have business ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law and a Russian oligarch under U.S. sanctions, which he failed to disclose during his confirmation hearing earlier this year. Read: Wilbur Ross has business ties with Putin allies, new report says After joining the Trump administration, Ross reportedly kept an interest in Navigator Holdings, a shipping company that is partially owned by his former private equity company. One of Navigator’s top clients was revealed to be Sibur, a Russian energy giant whose owners include Gennady Timchenko, a Russian billionaire and Putin ally who is the subject of sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department. Other top Sibur shareholders include Leonid Mikhelson, another Putin ally whose gas company, Novatek, is the target of U.S. sanctions, and Kirill Shamalov, Putin’s son-in-law. Ross’s stake in Navigator is reportedly held through a number of companies in the Cayman Islands. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, told NBC News that members of Congress who approved Ross’s nomination were unaware of the ties. “I am astonished and appalled because I feel misled,” Blumenthal told NBC News. “Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies.” 4. Who else was named? Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser, was linked to 22 Bermuda-based entities while at his former job at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

See:  Kremlin-backed money behind Facebook, Twitter investments Milner, a Russian venture capitalist who bought a Silicon Valley home for $100 million in 2011, bought large stakes in both Facebook and Twitter. The Paradise Papers found that hundreds of millions of dollars for those investments came from VTB, a state-controlled Russian bank, and Gazprom Investholding, another state-controlled Russian financial institution. Those ties are of particular concern after revelations about Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through misinformation spread on both Facebook and Twitter. Milner told the Guardian that his investments did not buy influence at Twitter, and he told both the Guardian and the New York Times that the investments were not politically motivated. “Nothing more than business,” he said, according to the Times. Milner’s companies later sold those holdings. Milner is also a major investor in a real-estate investment company, Cadre, partly owned by Kushner. Kushner did not initially disclose his stake in Cadre when he joined the Trump administration. 6. Is that all? Not by a long shot.

,11092017,Reuters,11022017,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - During her thirties, Kate was groped twice by a colleague, another pressed his leg against her during a meeting and a boss turned hostile after she rebuffed his advances. On some mornings, she vomited before going to work because she was so anxious about seeing a manager who made endless sexual innuendos - which eventually drove her to quit. “That guy was motivated by real contempt for women,” said Kate, 43, by phone, declining to give her surname. Kate said she did not dare speak out until her last day at the Boston firm, when she complained to human resources. Such reluctance to report sexual harassment is common, experts said, as people often fear they will not be taken seriously, be branded a complainer, get colleagues fired or lose their own jobs. While allegations of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s predatory sexual behavior have moved millions of women to share their stories of abuse on social media with the hashtag #MeToo, experts doubt there will be much change in the workplace. “In the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal, we have not been informed about any new commitments ... companies are taking to fight against sexual harassment,” said Deborah Gillis, head of Catalyst, a non-profit advocating for women in business. Only one of the 20 top Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies responded to queries from the Thomson Reuters Foundation as to whether the recent scandals had prompted them to revisit their sexual harassment policies. “Harassment, even in its most subtle forms, directly conflicts with company policy,” a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil said in emailed comments, adding that the oil producer had a zero tolerance policy toward harassment. The remainder declined to comment or did not respond. Yet sexual harassment in the workplace is ubiquitous, experts say. Between 25 to 85 percent of women reported being sexually harassed at work, a 2016 report by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found. But the federal agency, which is responsible for handling such allegations, received less than 10,000 complaints a year between 2011 and 2016. The EEOC found that employees routinely fail to report harassment because they anticipate negative reactions, such as being blamed for undermining morale or subjected to retaliation that could damage their career or personal reputation. U.S. companies’ reaction to the raging public debate about harassment has been muted. Experts said it was unlikely that corporations would take significant actions that could end a culture of silence over workplace abuse. “These scandals, if anything, are going to get organizations to dust off their copies of their (harassment) policies,” Margaret Stockdale, a professor of psychology at the Indiana University-Purdue University (IUPUI), said by phone. Some firms would also likely retrain employees and issue notices that sexual harassment is not tolerated, she added. Managers at Amazon and the global advertising firm Interpublic Group of Companies sent zero tolerance memos to their staff last month, according to media reports. Fidelity Investments chairman, Abigail Johnson, also sent a video message to staff about the Boston-based company’s “no tolerance” policy, after two managers accused of sexual harassment were fired. But such policies risk backfiring, said Meg Bond, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “If immediately the axe will always fall, it sounds tough. But what (research) found is that it sometimes discourages people from raising those issues,” she said. “You’re not ready to raise it in a way that is going to get somebody fired,” she said in a phone interview. Zoe Chance, an assistant professor of marketing at Yale University who has written on sexual harassment, said new approaches are necessary - but it is not clear what works. “Doing more of what companies are already doing, I don’t think will yield positive results,” she said. Up-and-coming initiatives include training bystanders to speak up when witnessing harassment, and to assess employees’ ability to treat colleagues with respect as part of their performances reviews, Bond said. Stockdale of IUPUI said programs which track acts of retaliation by those accused of harassment also appear promising in encouraging victims to speak out. Back in Boston, Kate, who told her story as part of the #MeToo movement, has modest expectations. She first went public on Twitter a year ago, when the nation was abuzz over a video showing Donald Trump brag about grabbing women by the genitals as he was running for the presidency. “I hope this isn’t a blip,” she said. “We had this identical conversation last year.” (This version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph 8) ","

The online trading firm said that October was characterized by strong U.S. markets, positive quarterly earnings on behalf of all sorts of companies and a global economy that is strengthening. Taken together, that appeared to influence retail investors' behavior on the positive side.

Mike Murphy,11092017,MarketWatch,11022017,"Published: Nov 6, 2017 2:42 a.m. ET Investigation raises questions about Wilbur Ross, other top members of Trump administration By A massive new leak of financial data has revealed how the world’s ultra-rich move trillions of dollars through offshore tax havens, and has raised new questions about the finances of top members of the Trump administration. The leak, known as the Paradise Papers, comes more than a year after the Panama Papers, for which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing offshore banking practices of the world’s elite. 1. So what is it? The Paradise Papers contains 13.4 million leaked documents, mostly from the Bermuda-based law firm Appleby and Singapore-based Asiaciti Trust. According to Appleby’s website, it specializes in providing offshore legal services for “global public and private companies, financial institutions, and high net-worth individuals.” Asiaciti Trust says it is “an international trust and corporate services provider.” As with the Panama Papers, the leaked data was shared with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which brought it to the ICIJ, which in turn led the collaborative investigation that involved nearly 100 media partners worldwide, including the New York Times, the Guardian, the BBC and NBC News.

                                    received investments from two Russian financial institutions with close ties to Putin though Yuri Milner, a business partner of Jared Kushner — a senior Trump adviser and the president’s son-in-law. See:  Kremlin-backed money behind Facebook, Twitter investments Milner, a Russian venture capitalist who bought a Silicon Valley home for $100 million in 2011, bought large stakes in both Facebook and Twitter. The Paradise Papers found that hundreds of millions of dollars for those investments came from VTB, a state-controlled Russian bank, and Gazprom Investholding, another state-controlled Russian financial institution. Those ties are of particular concern after revelations about Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through misinformation spread on both Facebook and Twitter. Milner told the Guardian that his investments did not buy influence at Twitter, and he told both the Guardian and the New York Times that the investments were not politically motivated. “Nothing more than business,” he said, according to the Times. Milner’s companies later sold those holdings. Milner is also a major investor in a real-estate investment company, Cadre, partly owned by Kushner. Kushner did not initially disclose his stake in Cadre when he joined the Trump administration. 6. Is that all? Not by a long shot.
