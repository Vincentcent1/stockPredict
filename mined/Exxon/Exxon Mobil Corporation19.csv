,03022017,Reuters,02232017,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) will work to enhance the privacy, security and scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, making it better suited to business applications, according to the founding companies, which said they plan to announce the initiative on Tuesday. The EEA joins a growing list of joint initiatives by large companies aiming to take advantage of blockchain, a shared digital record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. Companies in a wide range of industries are hoping that it can help them streamline some of their processes, such as the clearing and settling of financial securities. The EEA underscores the enthusiasm around the nascent technology, but also highlights some of the hurdles that companies must still overcome before they can deploy blockchain on a large scale. This includes ensuring that the technology can support the vast number of transactions processed by large corporations, while being secure enough to meet their stringent security standards. Unlike some other collaborative efforts, members do not need to pay a fee to participate in the EEA, for now. Ethereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications, was invented by 23-year-old programer Vitalik Buterin. Several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. Alex Batlin, global blockchain lead at BNY Mellon, one of the companies on the EEA board, said over the past few years banks and other enterprises have increased collaboration with the Ethereum development community, facilitating the creation of the EEA. “There is a lot more synergy in thinking than was ever possible before,” Batlin said. The EEA will collaborate with the non-profit foundation that promotes the development of Ethereum, the companies said. ","

Charles Bovaird,03022017,Investopedia,02232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs President Donald Trump's proposal to cut the top federal tax rate on business income to 15% would provide windfalls for certain companies such as financial services institution Visa Inc. (V) and retailer Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY), which generally pay close to the top rate of 35%, according to CNBC. Many investors will likely focus on Trump's joint address to Congress on February 28, during which he is expected to discuss his plans for tax reform, The Washington Post reported. However, many firms will likely derive little benefit from such tax reform, as they already have an effective tax rate below 15%. (For more, see also: How Trump's Tax Plan Is Dividing Corporate America.) While there are many companies that have paid a low effective rate in recent years, a perfect example is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). The online retailer has enjoyed an effective tax rate of 11% on its domestic income over the last eight years, according to CNBC. Amazon harnessed several special deductions, including ones involving accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, and research and development credits, according to the company's annual report. Amazon is not alone in benefiting from this special treatment, as companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) are ""routinely able to reduce their tax bill,"" Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at tax policy think tank Citizens for Tax Justice (CTH) told CNBC. Amid this situation, Exxon Mobil and AT&T Inc. (T) paid effective tax rates of 14% and 7% between 2008 and 2012, CTJ data reveals. Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and General Electric Company (GE) both had negative rates during that time, paying 2% and 11%,respectively. However, the special deductions that these companies have been leveraging are likely to disappear under Trump's plan, Stephan Unger, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Investopedia during an interview. The ""current special deduction possibilities are likely to get abandoned to make the system more transparent and efficient,"" he said. However, whether or not ""special tax treatments for specific companies"" will end up disappearing completely remains unclear, stated Unger. Tax expert Nate Smith offered a different point of view, stating during a separate interview with Investopedia that while ""certain industries (like oil and gas) benefit from specific deductions ... the deduction provisions that could be disappearing are not the thrust of what Trump's reform would target."" The more important matter is changing tax law so that companies will repatriate profits, said Smith. Currently, multinational corporations can keep these earnings overseas indefinitely, shielding them from the higher tax rates, he told Investopedia. Frequently, managing their international footprint is the means of minimizing tax expenses, said Smith. Originally, Trump's campaign tax proposal sought to rectify this situation, he noted. (For more, see also: Can Trump Tax Plan Bring Back Overseas Cash?) Because of policies like these, many global companies are paying very little in the way of taxes, Tenpao Lee, interim dean and professor of economics at Niagara University, stated during an Investopedia interview. Should lawmakers cut the top corporate income tax rate to 15%, it would give major companies greater motivation to move their profits back to the United States. However, the impact may not take effect immediately, said Lee, as companies would need time to adjust. For companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL), the effect would be significant, whereas companies like Exxon Mobil and Amazon would see less of an impact, he told Investopedia. ","Trump's Tax Cuts: Why Amazon, Exxon and AT&T Won't Benefit (AMZN, XOM) | Investopedia"
Mark Fahey,03022017,CNBC,02232017,"President Donald Trump's tax plan may cut the federal business income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but dozens of companies are already enjoying rates below the new maximum. The plan would be a windfall for retailers like Best Buy and CVS and for financial services companies like Visa and JPMorgan Chase, which tend to pay close to the 35 percent. On the other hand, companies that have access to substantial tax deductions and are already below 15 percent could suffer if the cut comes at the expense of closing tax loopholes. The average effective federal tax rate for profitable Fortune 500 companies was a little under 20 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to a 2014 study by the progressive tax reform organization Citizens for Tax Justice. About 35 percent of those companies were already under Trump's proposed 15 percent rate. CTJ is in the process of updating those calculations, and most companies' tax rates have been fairly consistent over the long term. It's hard to know exactly how Trump's tax plan would affect individual companies, partly because the administration hasn't released the details of its proposal yet. Two weeks ago, Trump said he would make a ""phenomenal"" tax announcement in two or three weeks. On Wednesday he said tax reform was ""very well finalized"" but that it wouldn't come until after health-care reforms. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday morning that he wants to see the reforms passed before Congress goes on its August recess. According to Trump's published tax plan, ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes."" Mnuchin said the administration is looking at a combined plan with Republicans in Congress, who have been pushing a 20 percent business tax and a controversial border adjustment tax. The final mix of reforms could very well benefit companies that are currently paying more than 15 or 20 percent, while driving up taxes for companies that already have low rates thanks to loopholes. Trump's strategy for keeping the tax cuts revenue-neutral depends in part on eliminating some ""special interest loopholes."" ""You can make the basic observation that companies like Exxon Mobil that are routinely able to reduce their tax bill will likely benefit much less than companies in the retail sector, which traditionally pay a lot closer to 35 percent,"" said Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at CTJ. ""Congress has enacted special tax breaks for a number of different industries, but retailers are generally unaffected and there aren't a lot of breaks designed for them."" Take a company like Amazon, which has paid 11 percent in taxes on its domestic income over the last eight years. According to the company's annual report, that rate was reached using a number of special deductions, including stock-based compensation deductions, accelerated depreciation deductions, research and development credits, and the domestic production activities deduction. Companies like Boeing (-1 percent from 2008 to 2012) and Honeywell (8 percent) use similar deductions and credits. ""The companies that tend to do the best tend to be companies that make a lot of capital investments, like utilities or manufacturers because the accelerated depreciation rules have been so generous over the last couple of decades,"" said Gardner. ""They give big rewards to anyone investing in factories or machinery."" Generally, the biggest deductions are more useful for companies in utilities, telecommunications, oil and gas, manufacturing and some pharmaceutical companies, while retailers, financial services, food companies and health-care companies tend to pay closer to the statutory rate. Take a look at all the profitable Fortune 500 companies below: The final impact of Trump's tax plan depends a lot on the revenue trade-offs that are included to pay for the cuts. A border tax, for example, would be a hit on retailers, but dropping the business tax rate would also disproportionately help retailers. Big companies may lose some deductions, but the plan also calls for a one-time repatriation of the $2.5 trillion in corporate cash sitting offshore at a 10 percent rate, which would save companies like Apple, Microsoft and Citigroup billions of dollars. As the plan stands now, it would increase the federal debt by $7.2 trillion over the first decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. An analysis by the Tax Foundation estimated revenues would be decreased by at least $4.4 trillion over the next decade, depending on the specific policy changes. Lawmakers could reduce some of those revenue shortfalls by removing any number of other tax loopholes, but Gardner isn't optimistic that those changes will be implemented. It's often much easier to propose steep tax cuts than it is to work out a way to pay for them. ""It's certainly true that an even-handed revenue-neutral reform would leave some companies substantially worse off, especially those that have relied most heavily on the tax breaks being taken away,"" said Gardner. ""But in the real world, Congress might answer the easy question of how far to cut the tax rate and avoid the hard question of how to pay for it."" ",These companies could lose the most from Trump’s tax plan
Reuben Gregg Brewer,03022017,Fool,02232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

,03022017,MarketWatch,02232017,"The Dow Jones industrial average stormed past 21,000 for the first time Wednesday as investors absorbed President Trump’s address to Congress, in which he pledged business-friendly proposals like tax cuts, deregulation and an increase in infrastructure and defense spending. Wednesday’s sprint past 21,000 matched the previous record for 1,000-point gains, set in 1999 when the Dow ran from 10,000 to 11,000 in 24 trading sessions. “President Trump came out and gave a presidential speech, which reassured a lot of people who questioned whether his administration would reach normality,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “The political uncertainty has been one of the factors holding the market back in the face of an improving economy. The fact that political uncertainty may be starting to subside may be counted as really good news.” Stocks motored across the board Wednesday. The Dow closed at 21,115, a 1.4 percent gain on the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index increased 1.3 percent, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index was up 1.9 percent. Apple, Boeing and Goldman Sachs Group have propelled most of the gain in the Dow industrials during its 1,000-point dash. Wednesday was the biggest one-day point lift for the blue-chip index since Election Day 2016. The 30 stocks have continued to surge from below 19,000 without looking back. “In terms of percentage moves, the move in 1999 was much larger,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. “Nonetheless, this only reinforces how strong the rally has been since the election.” Detrick said the strong earnings season is pushing the market forward more than Trump. “This helps justify the gains, as it isn’t all based on hopes for tax reform or infrastructure spending,” he said. “There is real economic improvement now that has sparked much of the rally.” William Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday night that tightening monetary policy had become “more compelling,” making a rate increase more likely for March 15. Higher interest rates are good for banks’ loan business. The market responded, with JPMorgan Chase shares up 3.3 percent Wednesday and Citigroup shares up 2.9 percent. Wednesday’s gains overshadowed the reported pricing of Snap Inc. at $17 per share, which would value the parent of the popular disappearing-message app Snapchat at almost $24 billion and above the projected share range of $14 to $16. The stock is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the “SNAP” ticker. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes was 2.45 percent. The 30-year yield climbed above 3 percent. Crude oil declined, and gold fell to $1,249.80 per ounce as investors swarmed stocks. Analysts said they did not see anything tying down equities. “Sentiment keeps improving,” McMillan said. “With consumer confidence at 15-year highs, with manufacturing sentiment continuing to move up, the economy and business are actually quite sound.” Read more: The big-deal lesson from the (not so important) Dow 20,000 What the Yahoo sale tells us about stock market bubbles This could change everything we thought we knew about investing  ","Dow busts through 21,000 threshold on feel-good Trump message - The Washington Post"

The surge for stocks, on the heels of Trump’s speech, also comes as the expectation for a rate increase by the Federal Reserve as early as mid-March have increased significantly. The probability for a March rate increase stands at 66%, up from a probability of 35% on Tuesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “What’s really changed on the economic front is tough to say,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, in an interview. “But the Trump speech moved expectations higher. Now it’ll be a surprise if [the Fed doesn’t] raise rates.” Read:  This stock-market rally isn’t all about Trump’s newfound ‘tone’ Adding to that, on Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for a U.S. interest rate increase has become “a lot more compelling.” “The economy is doing well, as we can see from today’s inflation and manufacturing numbers and any additional stimulus will put it into even a higher gear, and stock markets like that,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “I think the Fed’s clear optimism about the economy, even when not factoring in a Trump boost, is feeding the positive sentiment in the markets at the moment,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in emailed comments. “Investors don’t fear rate increases like they have in the past, instead it’s the pace of tightening that they’re focused on, and three hikes this year is clearly palatable,” he added. However some investors still see prices for stocks getting lofty after a string of records for U.S. equity benchmarks in 2017. Substantial gains in the markets have sent valuations to highest levels in more than a decade, with some analysts warning of potential pullbacks. “When markets are extended and overbought, they are vulnerable to any shocks that could trigger pullbacks or corrections,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. The Dow industrials ran from clearing 20,000 for the first time to clearing 21,000 in 24 sessions, tying a record set in 1999 for the shortest 1,000-point gain. While the current jump is smaller on a percentage basis, it’s still psychologically compelling, especially when it took nearly two years for the Dow to reach 19,000 after it first passed 18,000, as markets were dealing with an earnings recession, Detrick said. “Now, earnings are picking up and we’re breaking out in quick fashion,” said Detrick. “The concern now is if we got to 22,000 quickly and hit a blowoff top. Some pullback is normal and we want to see a correction. No more than 5% to 7% would be perfectly normal considering the rally since the election.” Themis’s Kepner also said that at some point markets will need specifics on the fiscal stimulus to justify current price-to-earnings ratios. “But for now, it seems that investors are content with the reasonable tone of the president, while impending rate hikes are seen in the context of an improving economy,” Krosby said. On the data front, a report on personal income and outlays showed that the cost of goods and services outpaced household income, with the year-over-year inflation rising to the highest level since 2012. Higher pace of inflation is another reason the Fed might be eager to go ahead with rate normalization sooner rather than later. The manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management rose to 57.7% in February, its best level in more than two years. Meanwhile, construction spending declined 1% in January. Car sales for February were mixed with General Motors Co.

In what many saw as a rather reserved speech, the U.S. president said he would push for around $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, and promised “massive tax relief” for the middle class and tax cuts for corporations. Otherwise, the speech was lacking in firm details about his economic plans. Read: Trump asks leaders for unity over overhauling taxes and health care.

But there is weakness in the Trump-leadership stocks,” Glazer said. “Financials are notably weak, Goldman is notably weak. That’s due to both profit-taking and high valuations.” For the holiday-shortened week, major indexes posted gains. The Dow rose 1% on the week while the S&P added 0.7% and the Nasdaq rose 0.1%. That marked the fifth straight weekly advance for the S&P and the Nasdaq, and the third straight for the Dow. The Dow is up nearly 9.1% over the past three months, with investors attributing gains largely to Trump’s November election victory. Investors are betting that Trump’s policies on taxes and regulation will accelerate economic growth and boost corporate earnings, but concerns are growing over the administration’s ability to deliver on the tax plans. Markets saw little impact from a speech Trump gave at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he said that the U.S. tax code would be made more fair. Investors are also looking ahead to an address that Trump is scheduled to make to Congress on Feb. 28, where he is expected to provide details on his highly anticipated tax reform proposals.

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world’s largest gathering of energy executives. Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said. Woods ran Exxon’s refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon’s growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding. “Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast,” Woods said. “These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics.” The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs. “The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots,” Woods said. Exxon last month pledged to boost this year’s spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company’s spending plans as an example of “a true American success story.” Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year. “This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,” Trump said. When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief. The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports. Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production. Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said. “I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken,” he said. “It underestimates the power of technology.” Woods highlighted Exxon’s research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas. “The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating,” he said. Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors. ","

,03092017,Reuters,03022017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

Patti Domm,03092017,CNBC,03022017,"The power of the North American energy industry is that it transcends borders, and while it was interconnected way before NAFTA, it is becoming even more so. The ties are deep rooted. In the early 1900s, primitive power lines sent electricity crackling across the border between Texas and Mexico. Canada has long provided the U.S. hydroelectric power, and all three countries now send oil, refined fuels and natural gas back and forth across the northern and southern U.S. borders on a daily basis. With trade the hot topic in Washington and now for all three members of NAFTA, the fallout from the renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement and the U.S. proposals about taxing goods at the border can't help but be an important topic when the global energy industry meets in Houston this week. In fact, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will deliver a keynote address on Thursday, which he tweeted would be about innovation and renewable energy. CERAWeek by IHS Markit runs Monday through Friday and participants include energy ministers from Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as CEOs from major oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Total. ""I expect to hear a great deal at CERAWeek from Prime Minister Trudeau and industry leaders about the importance and mutual benefit from the large cross-border energy [integration]. Whatever the eventual outcome of the NAFTA debate, they're not going to want to lose benefits,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS. The Trump administration promises to be a strong supporter of energy, removing regulatory hurdles for the industry and encouraging more U.S. drilling. Just last week former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was approved to be Energy Secretary. Perry has spoken positively about North American integration in the past, and until recently he was on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, which is building pipelines to take natural gas to Mexico. But the administration has also been critical of Mexico for what it claims are unfair trade practices and weak immigration controls. So even though the industry is intertwined, the future course for North American energy is murky. Guaranteed to be discussed at CERAWeek is the proposal from House Republicans to tax imports into the United States at a rate of 20 percent. The so-called border-adjustment tax is a major revenue generator for the House corporate tax reform plan. It is bound to generate as much debate in the energy industry gathering as it has in other affected industries, such as retail. Critics already say it would drive up both oil and gasoline prices. But proponents, among them big industrial companies, say the dollar would adjust by rising sharply and neutralizing some of the impact of higher prices. Conceivably, under the proposal, a barrel of oil from Canada could be taxed as it enters the United States, but the gasoline it is made into would not be taxed when it is sent to Mexico. Likewise, a barrel of U.S. crude would not be taxed as it enters Canada, but the gasoline that comes back down to New England could be taxed. The North American energy interconnections are complex and more established between the United States and Canada, which is the largest crude supplier to the United States and also a net exporter of electricity from connections that run along the border in numerous locations. Canada exports natural gas to the United States, and U.S. natural gas is sold in Canada. But the connections to Mexico are also growing, especially since the country embarked on a reform program to overhaul its energy industry and bring in new investment. It has also been aggressively planning new power generation. Mexico was importing about 4.2 billion cubic feet of U.S. natural gas per day in August, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and analysts say it could get to 5 billion in the near future. U.S. sales of gas to Mexico are also helping depressed U.S. natural gas prices from sinking even lower, analysts say. Gas pipeline exports to Mexico from the United States doubled since 2009. According to Citigroup, new cross-border pipeline capacity of 7 billion cubic feet is expected to come online by 2020, on top of the current 6 billion to 7 billion cubic feet. ""The growing energy integration of North America is very beneficial to all three countries,"" said Yergin. ""U.S. natural gas producers get additional markets, while Mexican consumers get lower-priced electricity generated with that gas. Canadians get markets for their oil, reducing U.S. reliance on Venezuelan oil, while American workers in manufacturing benefit from big equipment markets to the north."" Mexico also recently put out bids for offshore exploration, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the companies receiving awards. ""It will give them an opportunity to bring international technology and capital in to develop Mexico's deep water. Pemex never could have developed that,"" said Carlos Pascual, senior vice president of IHS Markit. Pascual has served as the U.S. State Department's special envoy for energy and coordinator for international energy affairs. He was also a former ambassador to Mexico. José Antonio González Anaya, director general of Pemex, will be a speaker at CERAWeek. Jaime Francisco Hernández Martínez, CEO of Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is also participating. ""The prospects are for additional gas supply only to continue to increase, and right now we see over the next five years, at least, relatively flat prices for natural gas globally, so the question then becomes, Where does American natural gas fit in?"" Pascual said. One solution is exporting it to Mexico, the largest buyer of U.S. natural gas. He said Mexico will also open up its unconventional drilling opportunities, holding its first round of bidding for unconventional oil and gas later this year. ""In the United States, there's been a huge benefit in the sale of natural gas to Mexico and also in the renewable-energy sector. Many of these companies buy GE equipment, for example. GE is a massive player here, particularly in wind turbines, so there's been a very significant boost to American commercial interests as a result of the development of natural gas and the power sector,"" Pascual said. The U.S. oil relationship with Canada, too, can only deepen when the Keystone XL pipeline is built. President Donald Trump waved on that controversial project shortly after his inauguration, and last week the White House said the TransCanada pipeline would be exempted from the new requirement that pipelines be built with U.S. steel.

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies. If you're thinking about investing in the oil and natural gas industry, you should put this diversified global player on your short list. Here are seven reasons now could be a good time to buy this stock with the plan to hold it forever. One of the biggest knocks against oil is that the world is moving away from dirty, carbon-based fuels. That may be true over the very long term, but it's going to be a transition, not an instant cut. For example, in OPEC's world oil outlook, the influential oil organization highlights continued population growth as a key driver of slowly expanding energy demand. OPEC expects renewable energy demand to grow faster than any other energy option through 2040, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. (Note that this is off a relatively small base.) Oil demand, meanwhile, is still expected to grow 0.6% annually. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase total demand by 17% between 2014 and 2040. Yes, renewables will be making the headlines, but oil isn't going away anytime soon. And there's enough room for oil demand to grow, even if its slice of the total pie declines. This is big-picture, but the first reason to look at ExxonMobil is that the hype about oil going away is overblown. The second reason to like Exxon is its global reach and product breadth. This goes beyond the concept that Exxon has operations around the world and, thus, isn't reliant on just one region to support its business. After all, oil is a globally traded commodity that's easy to transport -- which is one of the reasons the fuel is so popular. Being in the right places in the world is good, but not enough. Image source: Getty Images The real benefit of diversification at Exxon goes a little deeper. For example, it has operations in offshore drilling, onshore drilling, and Canadian oil sands; it drills for oil and gas; and it uses its oil and gas to make chemicals and other refined products, like gasoline. Drilling for oil is a huge part of the business, but it isn't the only part. And even when it comes to drilling, Exxon is doing more than just one thing. Take a look at 2015 for a quick example of the benefits of this diversification. It was a horrible year for the company's drilling operations, which saw earnings fall roughly 75% as oil prices fell. The company's downstream operations, though, saw earnings more than double, benefiting from the lower oil prices improving the company's refining margins. That wasn't enough to make up for the declines in the upstream business, but it certainly helped soften the blow of a deep oil downturn. Exxon's broad diversification, then, can help you stick around even in the worst of times. Points one and two are available from other oil majors, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX). However, when it comes to increasing dividends year in and year out, Exxon stands apart from the pack. It has shown a commitment to rewarding shareholders that no other oil major can match. To put a number on that, Exxon has increased its dividend year-in and year-out for 34 years. I highlighted Chevron here because it's the only oil major that comes close to Exxon, with a 29-year streak. While both are impressive, Exxon has a longer run. But there's more to this story. Chevron actually kept its dividend static for 10 consecutive quarters during the oil downturn that started in 2014. That's two and half years without a hike. The annual streak stayed alive because Chevron has a history of increasing the dividend during the middle of the year -- it was a timing thing. Exxon, meanwhile, increased its own dividend each year during the downturn. It shows a vastly different level of commitment to shareholders. That's not the only reason to like the dividend, which brings us to item No. 4 on our list. Right now, Exxon's yield is toward the high end of its historical range. This is a rough gauge of valuation suggesting that Exxon is trading cheaply relative to its own history. Put another way, now could be a good time to buy the stock. XOM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts However, a cheap price isn't a good deal if a company is on the edge financially. Luckily, Exxon is nowhere near the financial precipice. In fact, it's one of the best-financed oil majors around. True, like its peers, Exxon used debt to fund its dividend and capital spending during the downturn, when cash flow was tight. That's clearly not desirable. However, even after one of the deepest oil reversals in recent history, Exxon's long-term debt (at roughly $25 billion on June 30, 2017) makes up less than 15% of its capital structure. And also at the mid-point of 2017 it had around $4 billion in cash floating around. Exxon is still in rock-solid financial condition. So, Exxon is financially strong, which is great, but it's also one of the best-run oil majors around. It's really items five and six together that make the difference, here. The easiest way to see how well management runs Exxon is to look at its return on invested capital, which effectively examines how effective management is at investing its shareholders' money. Exxon has, historically, been among the top performers in the industry on this metric. Enough said. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts We've covered everything from the future of oil to Exxon's financial condition and operating results. One last point worth looking at is the change that's taking place today. In some ways, it's a mixed picture, which helps to explain the relatively high yield noted above. But don't get too caught up in the supposed bad news. On the negative side of the ledger, a longtime CEO recently left the company to take a prominent place in President Donald Trump's cabinet. That means a new CEO is taking the reins, which is always a risk. But he's a company man steeped in the Exxon way, so it shouldn't be a big problem. Exxon also materially reduced its oil reserves because of low oil prices, trimming nearly 20% off the total in early 2017. That's an unusual step for the conservatively run company, but it's important to note that most of the cut came from its Canadian Oil sands investments. It's still operating that business, and if oil prices go up enough, those reserves will quickly be added back to the total. The cut was driven by SEC guidelines, which, in this case, are backward-looking and don't consider the importance of oil sands to the future global oil equation. Over the long term, this is likely to be much ado about nothing. On the positive side, meanwhile, Exxon recently bought natural-gas-focused InterOil and completed a deal to materially expand its reach in onshore U.S. drilling. Without getting into too much detail, both investments appear opportunistically timed (energy prices are still relatively low), and they expand the company's business in key areas. These appear to be the types of moves you want to see a company make. And they weren't so large as to cause financial strain. To sum this point up, the bad news surrounding Exxon is making really big headlines, but the full story isn't nearly as bad as the negative press seems to suggest. Good things are still taking place, and the bad things aren't necessarily as bad as they seem. Through it all, Exxon is working solidly toward the future. I think it's pretty clear that I believe Exxon is a good story today. In fact, I like the story so much, I own the stock. However, a good company isn't always a good investment, because price matters -- and that is the key here. It's a good company, and as I noted in point No. 4, it looks like it's trading at a decent price, which is why Exxon is the kind of company you could buy today and never sell. There are negatives in the air today, but that's what brought about this long-term opportunity. ","

Jeff Reeves,03092017,MarketWatch,03022017,"Published: Mar 9, 2017 8:26 a.m. ET There’s cash, of course, but also energy stocks and gold By We’ve come a long way since the bear-market lows eight years ago, when the S&P 500 tallied an ominous 666 intraday on March 6, 2009, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average bottomed out at just under 6,500. A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run. I’m optimistic about the future, and enthusiastic about how far America has come in the past eight years. But it is important to acknowledge who missed out. Here are five assets that lagged the S&P 500’s

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data. So it is no wonder that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have proven a poor investment, with a return of less than 20% since the March 2009 lows based on the performance of the popular iShares TIPS Bond ETF

However, there’s also a good chance that the Federal Reserve will quickly act to keep inflation in check now that it has been striking a more hawkish tone.

But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

Gold is volatile, yes, but seems a decent bet going forward for tactical traders.

This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general. Profits remain seriously under pressure at both Big Oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A World Bank tribunal’s order for Venezuela to pay $1.4 billion in damages to Exxon Mobil Corp over nationalizations has been annulled, a lawyer for the Venezuelan government said on Thursday. The case at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes is one of many arising from nationalizations during late President Hugo Chavez’s 1999-2013 rule of the South American OPEC member country. “We were confident all along that our position was correct and are very pleased that the annulment committee agreed,” Venezuela’s lawyer George Kahale said. A reduction to the overall $1.6 billion award would be welcome news to President Nicolas Maduro’s cash-strapped government as it faces heavy foreign debt repayments amid a deep economic recession that has led to widespread shortages. The ICSID ruling, dated Thursday, said “portions of the award” were annulled but did not give a breakdown of figures. A spokesman for the U.S.-based oil company, Todd Spitler, did not confirm financial details, but said: “Exxon Mobil will continue to evaluate its legal rights and determine next steps.” Venezuela had challenged the 2014 award with various arguments, including that a previous decision from Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce to award Exxon $908 million should be deducted from the ICSID award. Chavez, the firebrand socialist leader whose rule was cut short by death from cancer, nationalized a range of oil ventures, including the Cerro Negro heavy crude project and a smaller project called La Ceiba, both operated by Exxon. Despite its appeal of the World Bank court’s initial ruling in the Exxon case, Venezuela’s government had hailed that as a success because the company had been seeking compensation of up to $10 billion. Chavez led a wave of takeovers that also encompassed the electricity, telecoms, metal and agricultural sectors. Many companies deemed the takeovers unlawful, and Venezuela faces more than 20 international arbitration cases. Supporters of Chavez’s nationalizations say he was right to take back control of Venezuela’s commodities riches to channel the profits into social programs at home rather than profits for multinational companies.

,03162017,Reuters,03092017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp, used an alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters, according to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The attorney general’s office said in a letter on Monday that it found Tillerson had used an alias email address under the pseudonym “Wayne Tracker” from at least 2008 through 2015. Wayne is Tillerson’s middle name. The letter was sent to a New York state judge overseeing Schneiderman’s investigation into whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change. In a statement on Monday, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said, “The email address, Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, is part of the company’s email system and was put in place for secure and expedited communications between select senior company officials and the former chairman for a broad range of business-related topics.” Jeffers said the company had provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman’s office and would respond to the claims in the letter in court filings. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. The letter, seen by Reuters, said Exxon had not previously disclosed the alias account. It asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the “Wayne Tracker” email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved. The letter said that Exxon had produced some 60 documents bearing the “Wayne Tracker” email but never said it was used by Tillerson for relevant communications at Exxon. It asked the court to order Exxon to identify whether any other email accounts were used by Tillerson. “Exxon’s top executives, and in particular, Mr. Tillerson, have made multiple representations that are at the center of OAG’s (attorney general’s office) investigation of potentially false or misleading statements to investors and the public,” the letter said. The case is People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016. ","

Matthew Johnston,03162017,Investopedia,03092017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs On paper, the United States has the highest corporate income tax, at 35%, amongst all of the OECD industrialized nations. President Donald Trump has promised to cut that rate to 15% even as he has boasted that his corporate empire has managed to pay little to no income tax in some years. Yet, he is not alone, as hardly any company pays the full 35%, as indicated in a recent New York Times article. Some companies have even managed to pay absolutely zero in income taxes, and no, it is not because they weren’t profitable. (For more, see: How Trump's Proposals Can Impact Your Taxes.) The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), in a recent study, found that over the eight-year period from 2008 to 2015, 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 21.2%. Over that same period, exactly 18 companies, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E Corp., avoided paying a single penny of federal income tax. The complete list of the 18 corporations is listed below in a graphic from ITEP’s report: A total of 100 companies avoided paying income taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015, and their combined pretax income during that period totaled $336 billion. Yet, instead of paying $118 billion according to the 35% statutory income tax rate, the number of tax breaks applicable to these companies allowed them to earn a negative effective tax rate. That means they actually earned more in their after-tax income than in their pretax income, often due to tax rebates from the U.S. Treasury. There are several major ways that corporations avoid paying taxes, or manage to earn tax subsidies. One way is through finding ways to shift U.S. profits to foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower tax rates, a practice known as offshore tax sheltering. Another way is through the use of accelerated depreciation. The relative degree of freedom in tax laws has allowed companies to expense the cost of their capital at a faster pace than it actually wears out. This allows a company to declare less income and thus defer paying taxes until later years, and as long as the company continues to invest, the deferral of taxes can continue for an indefinite amount of time. The giving of stock options to employees, as a part of their compensation, is another avenue that has helped companies reduce their total tax bill. When the options are exercised, the difference between what employees pay for the stock and its market value can be claimed for a tax deduction. Finally, some industries such as research, oil and gas drilling, ethanol production, alternative energy, video game and film production, are privileged by the federal tax code to receive certain tax breaks. (For more, see: How Big Corporations Avoid Big Tax Bills.) Over the eight years, more than half of the total tax subsidies, which totaled $286 billion, went to just 25 companies. AT&T raked in the largest amount with a total of $38 billion in subsidies over the period. Other major recipients included Wells Fargo at $31.4 billion, J.P. Morgan Chase at $22.2 billion, Verizon at $21.1 billion, IBM at $17.8 billion and Exxon Mobil at $12.9 billion.   ",How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying Income Tax | Investopedia
 ,03162017,CNBC,03092017,"BlackRock Inc, which wields outsized clout as the world's largest asset manager, planned on Monday to put new pressure on companies to explain themselves on issues including how climate change could affect their business as well as boardroom diversity. The move by BlackRock, a powerful force in Corporate America with $5.1 trillion under management, could bolster efforts like climate-risk disclosure practices developed by the Financial Stability Board, the international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. BlackRock, which holds stakes in most major U.S. corporations, identified its top ""engagement priorities"" for meetings this year with corporate leaders in documents to be posted on its website on Monday, with climate risk and boardroom diversity on the list. Reuters received advance copies of the materials. Michelle Edkins, set to oversee the outreach effort as head of a 30-person team, said BlackRock might want to hear from companies about how they are assessing the risk that climate change may pose to their operations. Edkins cited the example of how rising ocean levels could swamp a real estate company's valuable beachfront property. Some companies have shown leadership on the areas BlackRock considers priorities, Edkins said, while others need improvement. ""There are firms where we think they're probably not moving fast enough given the risks to the business,"" Edkins said in a telephone interview on Sunday. The action marked a step-up in BlackRock's advocacy with boards and executives, and comes after the fund giant was criticized by environmental and labor activists for not backing proxy resolutions dealing with climate change and other topics more often at shareholder meetings. BlackRock stopped short of pledging to vote more often against companies' management. It said it still prefers private meetings with executives and casts critical proxy votes only as a last straw. ""We can't micromanage,"" Edkins said. Activists said BlackRock deserves credit for making climate change a central focus. ""They have made a turn in the road. They are looking at their proxies differently,"" said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management in Boston. Outlining its priorities, BlackRock urged some companies to be ready to discuss concerns such as how they could use climate-risk disclosure practices developed by a Financial Stability Board task force. BlackRock also said it will expect that at companies in sectors associated with climate risk such as oil producers, miners or real estate companies, all directors should ""have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business"" and how a given company will address it. As a result of BlackRock's new initiative, Smith said Walden and others including a Seattle city employees' retirement system have withdrawn a proposal calling for the fund giant to review its proxy-voting process and record on climate change. Smith said BlackRock's new approach could make a difference such as on resolutions urging energy giants to report on the impact that public policies aimed at curbing climate change could have on their business. One such resolution at Exxon Mobil last year received support from around 38 percent of votes cast. BlackRock opposed the resolution and owned about 6 percent of the company at the time, securities filings show. Edkins said BlackRock's votes on such measures in the future would depend on circumstances like how they are worded. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment ahead of the company's proxy statement due next month. BlackRock also said it will look to understand how companies are working to increase boardroom diversity, such as adding more women. ""Diverse boards, including but not limited to diversity of expertise, experience, age, race and gender, make better decisions,"" BlackRock said in the documents. Some companies wrongly believe they already possess a diverse board of directors, Edkins said. ""A guy from Yale and a guy from Harvard does not count as diversity,"" Edkins said. BlackRock's guidance marks the latest investor call for corporate executives to pay more attention to matters to which they might have given little thought in the past. New deposits into funds that invest according to environmental, social or responsible governance criteria have been a rare bright spot for active fund managers lately. Big fund firms have taken notice. State Street Corp, a BlackRock rival, used International Women's Day last week to urge companies to improve their board diversity. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has advocated governance reforms in annual letters to other CEOs, such as urging them to avoid too much focus on short-term results. BlackRock said it also plans to press boards about worker issues in light of matters such as uneven wage growth. Edkins pointed to Wal-Mart Stores Inc as an example of a company that embraced the idea that higher wages can lead to a more-engaged workforce. ""Pay that doesn't seem to achieve some sense of equity within a company is likely to make an unattractive place to work,"" Edkins said. ","BlackRock vows new pressure on climate, board diversity"

Here's a bit of trivia for you: Over its lifetime, the popular crowd-funding website Kickstarter has created enough jobs to fill up an entire monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics job report. Image source: Getty Images. Even if you discount the part-time workers, that makes for more than three full-time jobs created for each successful start-up, confirming that Kickstarter ""companies"" are more than just one lonely nerd working in a garage. At the very least, each of those nerds has two full-time, salary-drawing employees on the payroll -- and a couple dozen collaborators doing piecework on his project. From 2009 through August 2015, when I last looked in on Kickstarter's progress, the company had helped its users attract crowd funding for more than 90,000 projects. That number has since kicked up to well over 120,000, with ""19,235 successfully funded projects"" in 2016 alone. Every dollar pledged to a successfully funded project resulted in $2.46 in additional revenue for the creator, leading to an estimated $5.3 billion in additional economic activity, says Penn. In total, the University estimates that Kickstarter has added $5.3 billion to the national GDP over the past eight years. It's also done its part as a responsible taxpayer. In 2016, the company says it paid a ""combined effective tax rate of 25%."" Image source: Kickstarter. Of course, unlike Exxon, Kickstarter is not a publicly traded stock. Privately held, it would ordinarily be under no obligation to disclose any of the facts and figures we've discussed here. That said, in 2015, Kickstarter reincorporated itself as a special kind of corporation -- a ""public benefit corporation."" PBCs also undertake to publish an annual benefit report updating the general public on the overall social impact their activities have had in the preceding year. It was this report that led to the revelations last week -- and we look forward to reading many more such reports as Kickstarter continues to lead the crowd-funding movement in years to come.

"Timothy Green, Matthew DiLallo, Dan Caplinger, and Brian Feroldi",03162017,Fool,03092017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. For long-term dividend investors, the best type of stock is one that can be bought and largely forgotten about, with the occasional checkup to make sure those dividend checks aren't in danger. A few of the Fool's contributors have identified four high-yield dividend stocks that fit this description. Here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), ONEOK (NYSE:OKE), and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) are great buy-and-hold dividend stocks. Tim Green (Microsoft): Being a technology company, Microsoft is more susceptible to disruption than other dividend-paying stalwarts. But it's not a company that investors need to worry too much about. Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has shed its image as a tech dinosaur and aggressively embraced cloud computing. Microsoft's stranglehold on the productivity software market remains intact, its cloud-computing platform is a strong No. 2 player, and innovations like the HoloLens augmented reality headset could put Microsoft right at the center of the next computing revolution. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's dividend, currently yielding about 2.4%, isn't all that high. But it's superior to that of the average yield of stocks in the S&P 500, which yields less than 2%. Microsoft produces an incredible amount of free cash flow -- nearly $25 billion in fiscal 2016. This fueled not only $11 billion in dividend payments, putting the payout ratio at about 44%, but also $16 billion of share buybacks. There's still plenty of room to grow the dividend going forward, even without much earnings growth. Microsoft's cash-rich balance sheet is another reason the stock is attractive to dividend investors aiming to buy and hold for many years. Microsoft had net cash of $37.8 billion at the end of the latest quarter, providing a massive cushion that can sustain the dividend even in the roughest economic conditions. While there are higher-yielding stocks available, Microsoft is a good option for long-term investors. Brian Feroldi (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): It is natural for income-focused investors to want to own stocks that offer up higher yields than the market in general. However, picking the right high-yield stocks can be tricky, since a massive payout can sometimes actually be a warning sign. One alternative that is available to all investors is to instead invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is focused on dividend stocks with above-average yields. If that sounds like a smart way to go, then I'd suggest that you give the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF a closer look. This passively managed ETF owns more than 400 stocks that have higher yields than the market in general. Its biggest holdings are all names that investors are familiar with -- think Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson -- which also provides investors with an extra layer of stability. The VYM currently offers a dividend yield of 3%, which is more than 50% higher than that of the S&P 500 average yield. Better yet, this fund's 10-year total return -- which accounts for the reinvestment of dividends -- is neck and neck with the S&P 500. VYM Total Return Price data by YCharts. Despite all of its benefits, Vanguard only charges a minuscule 0.08% expense ratio to access this ETF. Thus, if you are after a high yield but don't want to pick individual stocks, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF could be an excellent choice for you. Dan Caplinger (ONEOK): The plunge in energy prices in 2015 hurt companies throughout the industry, and even midstream infrastructure plays like ONEOK took big hits in their share prices. Yet after losing 70% of its share price, ONEOK has surged in the past year, nearly tripling as investors have figured out that not all companies have the same exposure to crude oil prices as others. ONEOK has an impressive slate of infrastructure assets, helping in the gathering process of natural gas from the Permian Basin, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-Continent regions of the U.S. and then processing, storing, and transporting it to key market centers in the energy industry. That business relies more on production volume than on price, and although the producers that ONEOK works with transport more natural gas when prices are favorable, the energy transportation giant has still been able to produce solid results as oil and natural gas prices have rebounded. ONEOK currently has a yield of 4.5%, but that figure should go up when the company completes its planned acquisition of its ONEOK Partners (NYSE:OKS) master limited partnership. Once the MLP deal is complete, ONEOK expects to boost dividends by a fifth, which should help the yield even further. As long as energy prices remain strong enough to induce its clients to send natural gas through its infrastructure network, ONEOK will be in position to keep delivering income to its investors. Matt DiLallo (Enterprise Products Partners): Pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has an excellent track record of paying investors an above-average dividend. In fact, since going public in 1998, the company has raised its payout 59 times, including in each of the past 50 quarters. These haven't been token increases, either, with its last payout representing a 5.1% raise over the prior year. All these increases have added up over the years, with the company currently yielding a very generous 5.8%. That payout is about as safe as they come. First of all, more than 85% of Enterprise's cash flow comes from fee-based service contracts, which provides it with very stable cash flow. Furthermore, the company pays out less than 80% of its cash flow, which is well below the near-100% payout ratios of the average MLP. Finally, the company has a top-notch balance sheet, evidenced by the fact it has one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs. Add it up, and Enterprise has the financial strength to maintain its distribution rather easily. That said, the company is more likely to maintain its distribution growth streak than simply keep things status quo. Fueling that growth potential is the fact that it has $6.7 billion of growth projects under construction and several additional projects under development. These new assets should enable the company to continue growing its cash flow, giving it more money to return to investors. Needless to say, this is one dividend stock that will not cause investors any worry. ","

A long way in equity prices, yes, but also a long way in status of the American economy. It wasn't hysterical when headlines at the time said that the Great Recession of 2008-09 was the worst since World War II — if not the Great Depression in the 1920s. But now, with many experts talking about a labor market at or near full employment and with corporate profits pushing new highs, things are looking pretty darn good. The recovery was far from easy, of course, and not everyone benefited equally. Some pockets of Americans still struggle to find work, and some investors have been left out of the big bull market run.

                                    — in a big way: Cash and equivalents: Up less than 1% We’ll start here because it is simple: If you went to cash in March 2009, you made a huge mistake by selling at the bottom and missing all of the rebound. And in truth, even if you want to cherry-pick the previous market peak in October 2007, you still made the wrong move if you went to cash at the prior high and stayed there. After all, the S&P 500 is almost 60% higher than its pre-recession high, and moving higher seemingly by the day. Peace of mind counts for something, I guess. And somehow if you timed the top and then also timed the bottom to get back in, you theoretically made a great decision. But in reality people who sell everything often make a big mistake on timing, so cash will remain a losing bet for now and forever more — even if some short-term volatility occurs. TIPS: Up less than 20% Despite inflation “heating up” in the recent data, the long-term trend for prices since the Great Recession has been pretty flat and mostly below historical norms. In fact, barring 2011, the rate of inflation hasn’t topped 3% since 2008 and has only been above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target for two out of the last 30 months of data. So it is no wonder that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have proven a poor investment, with a return of less than 20% since the March 2009 lows based on the performance of the popular iShares TIPS Bond ETF

But a look at the long-term price history of gold shows that the precious metal is quite volatile, and you have to time your holding pretty precisely to enjoy any outperformance. And if you’ve simply been sitting on gold since the March 2009 lows, unfortunately, you haven’t timed things very well. Gold prices are only up about 30% in the last eight years — from roughly $920 on that date to roughly $1,230 at present. It was hardly a boring run, however. Gold went on a big run across the early part of that period until it hit a 2011 peak of around $1,900, then steadily declined to a low of about $1,050 by the end of 2015. So what’s next for gold?

Gold is volatile, yes, but seems a decent bet going forward for tactical traders.

Of course, roughly 90% returns since the bear market lows still annualizes out to over 10% a year, so some folks may not see China as a that bad of a bet.

This fund is up only about 60% from the lows on March 9, 2009, even though the Hang Seng did significantly better. That means that while China stocks underperformed with less than half the gains of the S&P over the past eight years, domestic investors in China stocks could very well have done much worse. The outlook for Chinese stocks going forward is admittedly brighter, however. As I pointed out in February, the fearmongering over a looming debt crisis continues to be a bit too pessimistic, and there is still decent growth to be had in the region. And with valuations stretched and growth disappointing in many developed markets, China could return to favor in 2017 as investors look to diversify and wonder how much longer the bull market can run in the U.S. Energy stocks: Up less than 90% You may think the underperformance of energy stocks is a recent occurrence after the big flop

Of course, the ETF had a heck of a 2016 as energy stocks bounced back with a vengeance; the sector-specific fund tacked on about 25% last year to more than double the S&P 500’s returns. So what’s in store for 2017? Unfortunately for energy investors, I don’t expect that momentum to last. Big headwinds to energy prices remain thanks to oversupply issues specific to oil and gas, and a strong dollar holding back commodity prices in general. Profits remain seriously under pressure at both Big Oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp.

 ,03232017,Reuters,03162017,"Imperial Oil Limited, incorporated on May 1, 1978, is an integrated oil company. The Company is engaged in all the phases of the petroleum industry in Canada, including exploration for, and production and sale of, crude oil and natural gas. The Company's operations are conducted in three segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. The Upstream operations include the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas, synthetic oil and bitumen. Downstream operations consist of the transportation and refining of crude oil, blending of refined products and the distribution and marketing of those products. The Chemical operations consist of the manufacturing and marketing of various petrochemicals. Upstream The Company is involved in the exploration for and development of crude oil and natural gas in Canada. The Company holds an interest in the Kearl oil sands project, a joint venture with ExxonMobil Canada Properties.

If you invest for income, collecting your dividends is the most important thing. You don't care what's going on in an industry or what the outlook is for the stock market. You want to get paid on time and, preferably, with regular dividend hikes thrown in the mix, too. If that sounds like you, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are two dividends stocks you'll love. Enterprise Products Partners is one of the largest midstream oil and gas players in the country. It uses its network of pipes, storage, and processing facilities to get those fuels from where they are drilled to where they are used. Here's the interesting thing: The vast majority of its business is fee-based. That means volatile energy prices aren't that important to Enterprise -- only demand for its pipes and facilities. Image source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. This helps explain why the partnership has been able to increase its distribution for 50 consecutive quarters (the annual streak, just so you know, is up to 20 years). That includes right through the deep oil downturn that started in mid-2014. Enterprise has also managed to keep an average coverage ratio of around 1.2 times of late, providing a layer of safety for its distribution. Enterprise continues to invest for the future. It has roughly $6.7 billion worth of projects under construction today. Those projects will come online between now and 2019 and will support further distribution growth. This industry giant and its generous 6% (or so) distribution yield is a great option for dividend investors who hate risk. ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest integrated oil and natural gas companies, is another energy player that should be on the income short list. It has a roughly 3.7% dividend yield and, more importantly, it has increased its dividend every year for the past 34 years. You might highlight Chevron Corp.'s (NYSE:CVX) 29 years and 4% yield as a better deal, but there's more to a dividend increase than there appears. Exxon increased its dividend in the second quarters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Chevron increased its dividend in the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 -- it held the dividend steady for 10 quarters, two and a half years, in between. But because of timing, Chevron's annual dividend streak remained intact. Exxon's regular yearly increases are the better option if you don't like risk. EPD Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Exxon is one of the most conservative and best-run oil majors. For example, its long-term debt-to-equity ratio of around 15% is at the low end of the industry. Sure, it has added debt to maintain its capital spending and dividend through the oil downturn, like most of its peers, but it is still conservatively financed. On the operational front, it has long been among the industry's best performers on return on invested capital. This metric measures how well a company invests its shareholders' money. Regular dividend hikes backed by a solid balance sheet and a well-run company. That's the kind of stock risk-averse investors could love, particularly since the yield is currently toward the high end of the company's historical range. Stock prices go up and down -- all investors know that. Dividend investors, though, know that those price swings often open up opportunities in dividend stocks that keep on paying in good times and bad. If you can step back from the stock price and focus, instead, on the dividend, your risk equation changes, and price volatility suddenly becomes an opportunity to own great dividend payers like ExxonMobil and Enterprise Products Partners. If you hate risk, you can easily take solace in the regular distributions this pair has continued to pay and grow despite one of the worst energy downturns in recent history. ","

The shocks to oil prices created by the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the revolution in Iran in 1979 had far reaching consequences that still affect investor thinking today. Analyzing the aftermath of the ensuing energy crisis and stagflation (high inflation with stagnant growth) leads to one key conclusion oil stock pickers need to be aware of: the demand for oil is not price inelastic. Price elasticity of demand simply means that as the price of a good goes up or down its demand will adjust accordingly -- usually as price goes down, demand goes up. Therefore, when oil perma-bulls make the commonly heard argument that oil demand is price inelastic, they are saying that as oil prices rise, demand will stay constant. Image source: Getty Images This is important because it implies that oil demand won't taper off and consumers won't start using alternatives -- a bullish argument for oil.However, the evidence from the aftermath of the energy crises is that demand, at least past the short-term, is actually price elastic. In other words, demand can go down as prices go up. As you can see below, oil prices dictate the direction of oil stocks. The chart shows oil prices alongside a leading energy ETF, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSEMKT:XLE), which has ExxonMobile Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) as its largest holdings, along with a leading oil equipment and services ETF, the iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equip. (NYSEMKT:IEZ), which has Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) as its top two stocks. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Incidentally, there is a perfectly logical reason why oil services companies, like Schlumberger and Halliburton, should be more affected by spot oil price movements than oil exploration and production (E & P) companies (ExxonMobile and Chevron). Specifically, earnings at services companies are more dictated by near-term oil prices, which affect demand for oil field services, while E & P companies are better valued with their long-term oil reserves in the ground in mind, along with their exploration potential. The oil price shocks referenced above were dramatic by any measure. After adjusting for inflation, the Arab oil embargo crisis of 1973 saw oil prices jump from $20 to around $50 in no time -- an increase of 150% -- while the Iranian revolution led to an increase from around $55 to near $120 -- a near 120% increase. There are two arguments to suggest that the impact of these events had significant effects on demand. First, let's look at US motor vehicle fuel efficiency, a very important determinant of global oil demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates world oil demand in 2016 was 96.6 million barrels per day (mbpd), with the U.S. responsible for around 21%, and U.S. motor gasoline demand (9.3 mbpd) responsible for 9.6% of total world demand. The chart below shows how the crises spurred increases in fuel efficiency, with an inflexion in 1973 and a huge jump in 1979 -- evidence that higher oil prices will change thinking about fuel economy and reduce oil demand.

The second chart shows energy inputs into electricity plants in the U.S. As you can see below, in 1971 oil products were the third largest contributor, but following the oil crises of the 1970s actions were taken to wean electricity production away from oil and toward coal, nuclear, and natural gas. Again, it's a demonstration of the fact that oil demand can readjust to higher prices -- oil products are pretty much irrelevant to U.S. electricity production now. Data source: International Energy Agency Headline Data. ktoe is kilotonne of oil equivalent The evidence from the actions taken following the energy crises suggests that oil demand isn't as price inelastic as many oil bulls may assume it to be -- a key concern if you are pricing in significant oil price increases in future. Moreover, given the importance of U.S. gasoline demand, and the fact that 70% of petroleum in the U.S. has been used for transportation in recent years, what happens to global oil demand if the U.S. embarks on a wide-scale shift to energy-efficient electric vehicles? Even if you are bullish on oil in the long-term -- and there is a case for emerging markets to propel demand -- it might make sense to balance risk by investing in stocks that benefit from trends like electrification of vehicles and the use of natural gas.
