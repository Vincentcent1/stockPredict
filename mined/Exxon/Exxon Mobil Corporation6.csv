,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"The project, details of which have not been reported before, would allow Kuwait to diversify its gas imports in the wake a political crisis between Gulf states and major supplier Qatar. “Iraq needs to urgently reduce gas flaring as it trails behind all targets it has promised the World Bank,” said a senior industry source working on the project but not allowed to discuss it publicly. “The Kuwaiti gas project is a quick fix and an easy way to monetize gas resources.” The World Bank, which has repeatedly made reducing gas flaring a condition of lending to Baghdad, did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Toyo is proposing to construct a gas pipeline and start deliveries after 2019, industry sources said. Toyo’s chief financial officer, Kensuke Waki, told Reuters that talks about a pipeline and a petrochemical plant were ongoing but a final investment decision had not yet been made. Kuwait is very keen on the project and has offered a sovereign guarantee for up to 80 percent of the costs, industry sources said. No total cost has been announced. Kuwait’s oil ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq said last month that talks between Kuwait and Iraq were focused on a proposal to use gas to help pay Baghdad’s final $4.6 billion in war compensation payments. Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said talks were focusing on price and confirmed that supplies could be used to help pay off reparations. Industry sources told Reuters the talks have faltered over price, however. They said Kuwait is pushing for a price of less than $3 per mbtu (million British thermal unit), in line with U.S. Henry Hub prices. But that is less than half what Iraq pays in the north when importing gas from neighboring Iran. “The price of gas remains the key sticking point for now,” one of the sources said. He also said both Iraq and Kuwait were pushing to have the petrochemical plant built on their territory to further capitalize on gas deliveries. Iraq used to supply Kuwait with gas from Rumaila. Volumes reached as much as 400 mcf per day but stopped shortly after the 1990 invasion. More than a million claimants in Kuwait have been paid as part of Baghdad’s $52.4 billion reparations bill for the invasion. But Iraq, hurt by the 2014 fall in oil prices and its war with Islamic State militants, requested a delay on the last and largest tranche, which is due this year. Kuwait, although one of OPEC’s leading oil producers, has struggled to meet growing domestic gas demand. The shortfall has been estimated at 500 million cubic feet per day and is being covered mainly by LNG imports, including from Qatar. A decade ago Kuwait tried to build a pipeline from Qatar, but the move was blocked by Saudi Arabia. With relations between Riyadh and Doha worsening this year, Kuwait is looking to diversify its gas imports. Last year, Kuwait said it would be ready to buy up to 200 mcf/day of gas from Baghdad. Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Jihad said volumes could start at 50 mcf/d rising gradually to 200 mcf/d. Iraq’s gas reserves of 3.7 trillion cubic meters rank as 12th largest in the world but represent only a tenth of those of Iran, the world’s largest. It extracts large quantities of gas together with oil, however, and that gas is currently being flared. “Shell’s main aim was always to develop an LNG terminal and ultimately a petchem complex in Iraq,” said a Shell insider who worked on the gas project. With Iraq refusing to agree on a gas price with Shell, the project has hit a major impasse, industry sources said. Talks have also been complicated by Shell pulling out of the Majnoon oil fields earlier this year. “Iraq is furious at Shell and prospects don’t look that great for the Basra gas company,” one Iraqi industry source said. Asked about the negotiations, both Shell and the Iraqi oil ministry said discussions were ongoing and both sides remained committed to the project. ","

This sector includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling and refining, or integrated power utility companies including renewable energy and coal. ​The energy sector is a large and all encompassing term that describes a complex and inter-related network of companies directly and indirectly involved in the production and distribution of energy needed to power the economy and facilitate the means of production and transportation. Performance in the sector is largely driven by the supply and demand for worldwide energy. Oil and gas producers will do very well during times of high oil and gas prices, but will earn less when the value of the commodity drops. Oil refiners, on the other hand, benefit from the falling cost of feedstock to produce petroleum products like gasoline when crude oil prices drop. Furthermore, this sector is sensitive to political events, which historically have driven changes in the price of oil. Some of the largest companies in the U.S. energy sector include Exxon Mobil and Chevron, both of which are large international integrated oil companies. Duke Energy Corporation is one of America's largest electricity providers as measured by number of customers, and Peabody Energy is America's largest coal producer measured by tons of output. All these companies are part of what is commonly known as the energy sector. ​There are a number of energy-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) that afford retail investors exposure to the sector. Investors can vary which part of the value chain they want exposure to with any number of funds. For example, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) gives investors exposure to the upstream oil and gas exploration companies, while the VanEck Vectors Coal ETF (KOL) gives investors access to the coal industry. Investors wanting access to alternative energy can invest in the Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN). There are many different ways for investors to gain exposure to the energy sector, depending on their preferences and specific views about the growth and earnings prospects across the value chain. The energy sector is bigger and more diversified than just the oil and gas industry. Many investors feel renewable and alternative energy sources will be important in the future as the popularity of electric cars grows. Traditional hydrocarbon producers seem to be falling out of favor for the time being. ",Energy Sector | Investopedia

"Tyler Crowe, Matthew DiLallo, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The oil and gas market has been a tough nut to crack over the past few years. After the incredible collapse in oil prices from 2014 to early 2016, the industry has been slowly creeping back at a pace that many investors have ignored. There's no doubt that today's oil prices in the $50- to $60-per-barrel range isn't anywhere near the $100 or more we saw a few years ago, but the companies producing the stuff have made incredible strides to become profitable at these much lower prices. As a result, there are some rather attractive-looking investments in the oil and gas industry today. So we asked three of our investing contributors to each highlight an oil investment they see as a great buy now. Here's why they picked Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), U.S. Silica Holdings (NYSE:SLCA), and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Image source: Getty Images. Matt DiLallo (Marathon Oil): During the oil market downturn, Marathon Oil put together a simple playbook so it could start winning again at lower oil prices. The first few plays consisted mostly of blocking and tackling, such as strengthening its balance sheet, relentlessly focusing on costs, and simplifying and concentrating its portfolio. The company felt that if it could do those things well, then it could profitably grow within cash flows at lower oil prices, which would enable it to score gains for investors. Marathon has completed most of its more defensive-focused moves by selling higher-cost assets and using that cash to shore up its finances as well as bulk up its shale position. As a result, it can now generate enough cash flow at $50 oil to grow production by a 10% to 12% compound annual growth rate through 2021. Further, it can achieve that double-digit growth while also paying its current dividend. That ability to deliver healthy production growth within cash flow at $50 oil puts Marathon in an elite group. It's one of the few oil companies that can still create value for investors even if oil prices slip a bit while retaining uncapped upside if they continue recovering. That combination of a lower risk profile and high reward potential makes it an exceptional oil stock to consider buying, since it could still run up a big score for investors even if crude doesn't recover any further. Tyler Crowe (U.S. Silica Holdings): The frack sand market has been extremely volatile over the past few years. Back in 2014, it looked as if the industry could do no wrong, and then it became one of the hardest hit industries as the price of oil crashed and drilling activity in North America came to a grinding halt. Over the past year, though, the industry has picked back up in a big way. Just about every major frack sand supplier is running at full capacity and is in the process of expanding operations with new mines. There does appear to be some skepticism from Wall Street that all these new mines are needed. All this additional capacity could lead to another oversupply that kills margin. While that is a valid opinion, it may help boost the argument for U.S. Silica in the coming years. U.S. Silica has the most ambitious growth plans of its frack sand peers. Between acquisitions and greenfield projects, the company has either completed or is constructing facilities to expand production by 9 million tons per year, or a 70% increase from its production capacity from a year ago. Adding that much capacity sounds risky, but management is de-risking some of these projects by signing up customers to long-term takeaway contracts that ensure a high level of demand. According to management, the company has already secured takeaway contracts for 1.2 million tons of its recently announced 2.6 million ton-per-year facility near Midland, Texas, that also includes cash pre-payments to help fund the mine. Moves like this suggest the company's growth plans aren't as risky as they sound. If we assume that last quarter's results can be replicated in the coming quarters -- it seems reasonable as it expands capacity and grows margin through its logistics business -- then perhaps today's price-to-earnings ratio of 42 might not reflect the value in U.S. Silica's shares. MRO data by YCharts Reuben Gregg Brewer (ExxonMobil Corporation): Exxon is one of the world's largest integrated oil majors. It has historically traded at a premium to its peers, which it continues to do today. Only BP plc's (NYSE:BP) price to tangible book value is anywhere near Exxon's. But the other oil majors have been closing the gap. This is an interesting dynamic. In fact, Exxon's price to tangible book value sits near a 10-year low. That suggests that, relative to its own history, Exxon is cheap. Most of its peers appear either fairly valued (trading around the midpoint of their historical range) or even expensive (BP's ratio has moved notably higher this year) on this metric after stock price advances that have, basically, left Exxon behind. Exxon is down around 8% so far this year, while Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-B) tops the advancers at a roughly 13% gain. However, Exxon continues to be a top performer when it comes to putting shareholder money to work, as measured by return on capital employed. Recovering oil prices have led to improvement at all of the majors on this metric, but only ENI (NYSE:E) has excelled to the point where its returns are notably higher than Exxon's. Exxon continues to perform well as a business. In short, Exxon looks cheap on a relative basis compared to its history despite an improving industry outlook that's lifted the market's view of its peers. If you're looking for a good value in big oil, Exxon may be the right choice for you. ","

,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Darren Woods is reorganizing the company’s refining operations, part of a push to boost profits amid volatile oil and natural gas prices, the company said on Monday. The changes at the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer are the most sweeping to date by Woods, who became chief executive in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. Woods has moved first to reshape the parts of the businesses he knows best, according to sources familiar with the matter. Before taking the helm at Exxon, Woods ran Exxon’s refining operations. Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker confirmed the downstream business overhaul in a statement, adding the company expects it will “improve decision making and enhance performance in the market.” The parts of the business impacted were refining and marketing divisions, said spokesman Scott Silvestri. Company sources told Reuters Exxon’s chemical operation also has been restructured, but Silvestri denied this. It was not immediately clear if the changes will involve job cuts or executive departures. Exxon’s Huffaker said she could not say if there would be any impact on jobs. The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the downstream business as the company works to improve its exploration and production operations, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. The downstream restructuring, disclosed internally last month, will combine the fuels and lubricants division with the supply and refining divisions. Financial responsibility for the merged operation will rest with country and regional chiefs who report to Exxon’s Irving, Texas, headquarters rather than divisional bosses as previously, according to people familiar with the matter. The changes are designed to simplify operations and increase accountability for profitability, the sources said. Exxon’s refining and chemical operations have grown in stature under Woods, delivering steady earnings compared with its oil and gas production. Exxon operates 22 refineries in 14 countries, processing nearly 5 million barrels of oil per day. The firm builds chemical and refining plants in the same location, allowing managers to shift production between fuels or chemicals based on demand. The changes come as Exxon expands the refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year’s results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. In some quarters, Exxon would not have made any money were it not for its refineries. This year, the company’s oil and gas business bounced back to a $5 billion profit during the first nine months on stronger crude prices. Refining earnings were $4.03 billion and chemicals $3.25 billion, respectively, for the first three quarters this year. Some staff members have raised questions as to whether there is any need to alter a system seen as largely successful, said the sources who declined to be identified. It was unclear if the changes would impact an internal accounting practice known as general interest principle. That rule permits certain transactions to be loss-making for a local division if they are beneficial for the corporation as a whole. Exxon did not comment on any potential accounting changes. ","

,11302017,Reuters,11232017,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) BANGKOK, November 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has affirmed the National Short-Term Rating on ESSO (Thailand) Public Company Limited's (Esso) bills of exchange revolving programme of up to THB12 billion at 'F1(tha)'. The maturity of each series of bills is no more than 270 days under the programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Parent Support: Fitch believes Esso has strong financial support from its ultimate parent, Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil). This was evident from the increase in inter-company loans from the parent group during the period of high financial leverage in 2014, in addition to the THB54 billion in standby credit facilities and the THB12 billion revolving loan facility from the parent group. Since then, the proportion of inter-group financing has remained high at 60%-65% of total financing, although Esso's total debt and financial leverage have decreased substantially. This has helped Esso to reduce its exposure to external debt. Esso is also able to leverage its parent's worldwide procurement network for crude oil and refined products, and use ExxonMobil's technology and engineering services, human resources and R&D to improve its operational efficiency. Higher Rating Headroom: Esso's financial buffer against drops in refining margins has increased, as its debt has decreased significantly for the past two and a half years thanks to strong operating cash flows and low capex. Esso's debt fell to THB16.9 billion at end-September 2017, the lowest level in 10 years, from THB35.7 billion at end-2014. Its leverage, as measured by FFO adjusted net leverage, decreased to 1.6x in the 12 months to end-September 2017. Fitch expects Esso's debt to continue falling in 2017-2018 due to a lack of major capex. However, leverage is likely to increase moderately in 2017-2018, as Fitch expects Esso's operating cash flows to soften and oil prices to gradually recover. Moderate Capex: Esso does not plan a major expansion or large investments in the next two to three years. The company aims to improve its production efficiency and increase its use of challenged crudes to control costs and improve margins, as well as enhance its retail network. These are small projects with low capex requirements. Esso's capex has been moderate at THB900 million to THB1.4 billion a year for the past four years, and is likely to remain at these levels in the next two to three years. Nevertheless, Esso may need to make a large investment to improve its refinery to comply with potential changes in emission standards, following the Euro V emission standard, although the government's plan to revise the standards remains undecided. Integrated Refiners: The rating also reflects Esso's complex refinery capacity, its favourable access to raw materials and established brand name. The integration of paraxylene (PX) production widens Esso's output range, optimises its product lines, and helps to reduce the volatility of the company's refining margins, although excess regional PX capacity has weakened margins. Esso also has a strong position in fuel retailing as Thailand's third-largest fuel retailer by volume in 2016 with 542 retail stations. Highly Cyclical Business: Esso's credit profile is tempered by its high vulnerability to oil prices, refining margins and petrochemical product-to-feed margins, as well as high working-capital volatility, which can significantly affect its earnings and cash-flow generation. The company is also exposed to single-production-site risk. DERIVATION SUMMARY Esso's rating reflects the integration of its refinery, petrochemical production and oil retailing businesses. Esso's business profile is moderate relative to Thai downstream oil and gas peers with its leverage relatively higher than most of its peers. Esso's operating scale is smaller than that of IRPC Public Company Limited  , while its financial leverage similar. IRPC has larger refinery and petrochemical operations and generates more EBITDA from the petrochemical business, resulting in higher margins. However, we view Esso as having stronger linkages with its ultimate parent, ExxonMobil. Esso has much smaller operating scale than PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited and Thai Oil Public Company Limited and higher leverage than these two companies. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Crude oil prices (Brent) of USD52.5 per barrel in 2018, USD55 per barrel in 2019, and USD57.5 thereafter, with Esso's crude procurement costs adjusted for applicable premiums - High gross refining margin in 2017, and softer margin in  2018 and thereafter - PX product-to-feed margin to gradually increase in 2019-2021 - Maintenance capex and small efficiency improvement projects in 2017-2021 - Dividend payment in 2018 and thereafter RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - A significant strengthening of its links with ExxonMobil group Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Weakening ownership and support from ExxonMobil group - Weaker access to bank loans and debt capital market - Sustained high financial leverage exceeding 6.5x (measured by FFO adjusted net leverage) LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Esso had outstanding debt of THB16.9 billion at end-September 2017. Most of the THB10.4 billion of debt due to mature within 12 months was short-term debt. This will be supported by cash and cash equivalents of THB776 million, estimated free cash flow of THB1.8 billion in 2018 and the available undrawn revolving loan facilities from the ExxonMobil group totalling THB66.0 billion at end-September 2017 as well as available uncommitted facilities of THB32.4 billion from financial institutions.

It’s widely regarded as the best single measure of large-cap U.S. stocks, and, like the Dow, has become synonymous with “the market.” The index includes 500 top U.S. companies in leading industries, and captures about 80% coverage of available market capitalization. Created in 1957, it was the first U.S. market-cap-weighted stock market index. While the Dow used to be the main gauge of economic health in the U.S., the S&P 500 has become the leading stock index because of its broader scope. The index covers all major sectors of the market, and some of its top constituents (by index weight) include Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway B, Johnson & Johnson, ExxonMobil and J.P. Morgan Chase (current as of Oct. 23, 2017). Although the S&P 500 contains 500 constituents, it may contain greater than 500 “constituent trading lines” since some companies are represented by multiple share classes.  Created By: Created by Standard & Poor’s in 1957. Currently maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Number of Companies: 500 large-cap companies (market cap of $6.1 billion or greater) Types of Companies: The S&P 500 tries to cover all major areas of the U.S. economy. Selection Criteria: Components are chosen by the U.S. Index Committee and rebalanced quarterly. How it's Calculated: The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index.  Advantages: The S&P 500 is one of the best benchmarks in the world for large-cap stocks. By including 500 companies, it offers great diversification and accounts for approximately 80% of the U.S. market. The performance of the S&P 500 is considered one of the best overall indicators of market performance and many investors and fund managers attempt to outperform the index. Disadvantages: The index contains only large-cap U.S. companies. As such, may not be the best benchmark for investors who own small-cap stocks and/or foreign companies. Also, the top 50 companies by market capitalization account for about 50% of the index’s value – so they have a larger impact on the index calculation. Investing: There are several index funds that track the S&P 500, including the popular SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), or “Spider” – the most actively traded ETF by trading volume. You can also trade the e-mini S&P futures contract (ticker symbol ES). (For more, see SPY: SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF.) ",Index Investing: The Standard & Poor's 500 Index

There's nothing quite like a good, solid oil dividend, right? Anyone looking for a strong dividend payout backed by torrential cash flows must surely be impressed by ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield and 34 years of uninterrupted annual dividend increases. Exxon is indeed a great income stock, but there are many dividend stocks out there that offer even better policies than the oil giant. You don't even have to stick within the energy market. A panel of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool has put together a handful of stocks with better yields than ExxonMobil. Read on to see how Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) can beat the big oil stocks from the perspective of a dividend hunter. You can do better than Exxon. Image source: Getty Images. Jordan Wathen (Spirit Realty Capital): Shares of this retail-focused REIT are too cheap to ignore. Though the company has struggled under the weight of its largest single tenant, Shopko, investors are pricing the stock as if its portfolio were filled to the brim with similarly weak tenants. That's not the case, in my view. To be sure, Shopko is a large tenant for Spirit Realty, making up about 7.8% of contractual rent, compared with 2.6% and 2.4% for its second- and third-largest tenants, respectively. But the portfolio, which includes more than 2,400 properties, is generally leased on a triple-net basis to high-quality restaurants, pharmacies, convenience stores, and movie theaters, all of which derive benefits from proximity to their customers (they can't just move to lower-cost locations). I suspect that an upcoming spin-off that will push Shopko assets into a new REIT will help investors better understand the value of the remaining assets, particularly its triple-net lease portfolio. With a current yield of 8.5%, the company yields nearly twice as much as other triple-net lease REITs, including Realty Income Corporation and National Retail Properties. The market is pricing Spirit as if there are several more Shopkos to come. At the current share price, I think it makes sense to take the other side of the trade. Chris Neiger (Verizon): It's nearly impossible to put together a list of dividend stocks with high yields and not mention Verizon. The telecom giant currently has a trailing annual dividend yield of 4.9% and has a 10-year history of raising it every year. The company's wireless business drives its top line, and increasing competition from its rivals has kept Verizon on its toes lately. Wireless revenue of $21.6 billion fell more than 2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017, but there isn't much for investors to worry about over the long term. Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

"Jamal Carnette, CFA",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's been a tough time for value investors. Earlier this year, a research report from Goldman Sachs noted that value investing -- selling higher-valued stocks and buying undervalued ones -- no longer provided investors with the same overperformance as it once had. In fact, the strategy would have resulted in a cumulative loss of 15% over the prior decade, while the S&P 500 has nearly doubled. That's a significant shift: In 1997, Professors Eugene Fama, a Nobel prize winner widely considered the father of modern finance, along with Kenneth French, published a research study showing that during the 20-year period ended 1995, the difference between investing in low book-to-market multiples (value stocks) versus high multiples (growth stocks) was 7.6% per year. Image source: Getty Images Amazon's most valuable assets at its 2017 robotics challenge. Image source: Amazon.com. Both Einhorn and cable mogul John Malone have identified the culprit that's destroyed traditional value investing: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). After jokingly calling the company the ""Death Star,"" Malone noted that the richly valued company would disrupt every industry on the planet. Einhorn wrote, ""Our view is that just because Amazon can disrupt somebody else's profit stream, it doesn't mean that Amazon earns that profit stream. For the moment, the market doesn't agree."" Traditional value isn't dead, but rather the definition of value has changed. Fama and French used price-to-book as their dominant metric. Broadly, this favors more ""stuff"" on the books -- assets such as plants, machines, equipment, and buildings. A report from 13D research, by way of The Reformed Broker, noted that the five largest companies by market capitalization in 2007 were mostly in asset-heavy industries: PetroChina, ExxonMobil, General Electric, China Mobile, and Bank of China, and were worth a collective $2.3 trillion. Today, the top five companies are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon, which are now worth $3 trillion with fewer assets (excluding cash) and 44% fewer employees. The issue for value investors is it's hard to measure non-tangible assets and employee quality, but it's necessary. In 2013, Bloomberg noted that as little as 7% of the value of large corporations is from tangible assets, with intangibles such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights accounting for more than 90%. Unfortunately, generally accepted accounting rules do a poor job of accounting for intangible assets on both the balance sheet and the income statement. Employees are not a bookable asset, and using the price-to-earnings ratio is a poor metric to value companies with high intangible assets, because the internal costs of patent development are mostly expensed as occurred -- not capitalized, where they appear on the balance sheet -- while the economic benefits often occur later and over multiple periods. Value investors need to incorporate intangible assets into their analysis, because these trends are only accelerating. It isn't that value investing is dead -- it's just the definition of value has changed, and investors need to change along with it. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"A lawyer for Exxon told justices on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that his arguments were focused only on whether Attorney General Maura Healey had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the oil company misled consumers and investors. “We are not asking this court to weigh in on the causes of climate change,” Justin Anderson, Exxon’s lawyer, said. But Anderson said Healey was improperly trying to establish jurisdiction in part based on more than 300 Exxon-branded gas stations in Massachusetts operated by franchisees to justify probing the Texas-based company’s actions elsewhere. “They can only be held to account here for what they’ve done here,” Anderson said. Richard Johnston, Healey’s chief legal counsel, countered that Exxon had control over the franchisees’ marketing and  conducted advertising on their behalf. “We should be able to find out whether they knew about impact of fossil fuels on global warming so they should have said more in those advertisements,” Johnston said. He urged the court to allow Healey to carry on her probe into whether Exxon failed to disclose what it knew to consumers and investors and engaged in a campaign to sow doubts about the science of climate change. Healey, a Democrat, and New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sought records following news reports in 2015 how Exxon’s own scientists determined that reducing fossil fuel combustion was needed to mitigate the impact of climate change. Those reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon contends that the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. After Healey issued a demand for documents in April 2016, Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the records request and another case in federal court challenging her and Schneiderman’s investigations. Tuesday’s hearing came after Exxon appealed a lower-court judge’s January ruling denying its request to avoid handing over the documents. While the six justices gave no indication how they would rule, some expressed skepticism that the 300 stations could not create jurisdiction, even if consumers bought gas from a franchisee. “They believe they’re buying Exxon gas,” Justice Elspeth Cypher said. “The citizens of this state believe that’s what they’re buying.” (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped word “of” in 3rd paragraph, removes extra “if” in seventh paragraph) ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"Neil Chapman, the head of its global chemicals operations, was named to the company’s management committee, a board-elected panel that typically serves as a stepping stone for future chief executives, Exxon said on Friday. Chapman, 55, joins CEO Woods and four other senior vice presidents on the committee, which oversees the company’s global operations. The president of ExxonMobil Chemical Co also was promoted to corporate senior vice president. The merger of the world’s largest publicly-traded oil producer’s refining and marketing operations will take place in the first quarter, the company said. Bryan Milton, 53, president of Exxon’s fuels, lubricants & specialties marketing business, was named president of the new ExxonMobil Fuels & Lubricants Co effective Jan. 1. Dennis Wascom, president of Exxon’s refining and supply subsidiary, will become vice president of operational excellence, safety, security, health and environment, said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri. Woods took over the top job in January after former chief Rex Tillerson resigned to become U.S. secretary of state. The merging of refining, lubricants and marketing is the first major move by Woods since replacing Tillerson and is in the company’s downstream operations, which he used to lead before taking over as CEO. The reorganization aims to squeeze more profits from the fuel and lubricant businesses as the company works to improve its exploration and production operation, which have struggled since 2014 to adjust to lower oil and gas prices. The company’s downstream sector has grown in prominence since Woods took over leadership of Exxon. The changes come as Exxon expands its refining division. The company is investing $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The refining and chemicals arms contributed more than $4.2 billion apiece to 2016 earnings, compared with a $196 million profit from exploration and production. Last year’s results were affected by sharply lower crude prices. ","

Alan Farley,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Chevron Corporation (CVX) have underperformed throughout 2017 but could lift into market leadership in 2018, underpinned by a resilient crude oil market and strong U.S. economy, supercharged by tax cuts and deregulation. However, buying these stocks too early could be hazardous to your bottom line because end-of-year tax selling may inhibit buying power until the calendar flips in January. The WTI crude oil contract has lifted to a two-year high and could soon test resistance in the lower $60s. Meanwhile, OPEC and Russia have just agreed to extend oil output curbs through the end of 2018, allowing U.S. energy companies to benefit from higher commodity prices as well as ramped-up production levels because our government has not agreed to similar cuts. Taken together, energy stocks at all capitalization levels could finally enter bull market advances. (See also: A Guide to Investing in Oil Markets.) Exxon Mobil shares broke out above the 2008 high at $95.64 in December 2013 and hit an all-time high at $104.76 in July 2014. A steep downturn accelerated in the second quarter of 2015, finally coming to rest at a five-year low in the mid-$60s in August. The subsequent recovery posted two broad rally impulses, lifting the stock into the closely-aligned 786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement and failed breakout levels in July 2016. A shallow but persistent correction off that resistance level finally ended in the mid-$70s in August, giving way to a bounce that mounted the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) in October. The stock has been crisscrossing the moving average for the past two months, trying to build support, while price action since February 2017 has carved a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern. This potent combination predicts that a breakout above the neckline at $84 will generate a test at long-term resistance in the mid-$90s. On-balance volume (OBV) bottomed out in August 2015 and lifted into a 52-week high in July 2016. A sideways chop into the second half of 2017 signaled a delicate balance between bulls and bears, ahead of a strong buying impulse that reached a two-year high in October. This renewed buying interest could mark a tradable low ahead of superior 2018 performance. Even so, it is likely that positions taken in the mid-$80s following an inverse head and shoulders breakout will require a relatively long-term holding period to build sizable profits. (For more, see: Exxon, Chevron and Oil Are Breaking Out.) Chevron stock has carved a stronger price pattern than its Dow rival, but significant technical challenges remain. It broke out above the 2008 high at $104.63 in 2011 and entered a rising wedge pattern that persisted into the July 2014 all-time high at $135.10. The subsequent downturn broke wedge support in October and failed the multi-year breakout in June 2015, triggering a decline that continued into August, when it bottomed out at a five-year low near $70. A healthy uptick through 2016 unfolded through three rally waves that stalled near $120 in December. Loyal shareholders suffered through a persistent decline in the first half of 2017, with strong support at $102 finally taking hold in July. The stock rallied back to the 2016 high in October and dropped into a narrow trading range that may now complete the handle in a cup and handle pattern. A breakout should bring the 2014 high into play, with that level marking the final barrier ahead of a bull market advance that could add many points in the coming years. Meanwhile, OBV has just lifted above the December 2016 recovery high and reached a three-year high, predicting that price will play catch-up in coming months. Even so, the stock has gained less than two points to far in 2017, increasing the odds that tax selling pressure will inhibit buying power into early 2018. (See also: The Top 3 Chevron Shareholders.) Big oil price action has improved greatly in the second half of 2017, lifting major players into price levels that could support healthy 2018 upside. Chevron looks like a better bet than Exxon Mobil in this bullish scenario, set to test this decade's bull market high after it mounts resistance at $119.

Fred Imbert,12072017,CNBC,11302017,"Mark Fisher, one of the most well-known traders on Wall Street, has put together an alternative index to the 120-year-old Dow Jones industrial average. Fisher, CEO of MBF Clearing, launched the ""Essential 40"" index earlier this year,  an index that includes Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Visa and UnitedHealth, among others. KKM Financial launched a mutual fund on Monday, the Essential 40 Stock Fund (ESSIX), which tracks the index. ""It's today's version of the Dow Jones,"" Fisher told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday. ""It's the 40 most essential names to the way you live."" ""Without these names your life is blank,"" he said jokingly. Below is a chart of the 40 stocks in the Essential 40 index and how they have performed in 2017: Throughout its history, the Dow has been the go-to benchmark of the U.S. stock market for Main Street market watchers. The biggest difference between the Dow and Fisher's Essential 40 index — aside from the number of stocks in them and how long they've been around — is how they are weighted. The Dow is a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with a higher price will have a bigger sway on the index's overall direction. Stocks in the Essential 40 index, meanwhile, all have a 2.5 percent weight on the index. Fisher is one of the most wildly followed commodities traders on Wall Street, being known for making calls on oil and energy. He has also worked with the likes of legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones. Oil prices are up about 7 percent in 2017, following a year where they shot up 45 percent. But at current levels, Fisher thinks crude is ""trapped."" ""I think the upside is limited to $60-$63 and the downside is capped around the high $40s,"" he said. ""I think that, if we go up much more, what will happen is you'll see a lot more rigs come online."" Fisher also said that a lot of people in OPEC and Russia are comfortable with crude trading at these levels. U.S. oil gained 0.37 percent to trade at $57.68 per barrel on Tuesday. Fisher also said he likes shares of Barrick Gold here on the dip. The stock is down 14 percent for the year. ",Legendary trader Mark Fisher launches a 'modern day' version of the Dow average

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) seems like it should be one of the best dividend stocks on the market. The company makes a commodity that isn't going to be replaced anytime soon and is one of the biggest names in energy today. But peek under the hood of ExxonMobil's business and the picture gets dark pretty quickly. Oil's future is in question, the company isn't investing in its own production, and the dividend payout ratio is already at a troubling level. Here's why investors should be concerned about ExxonMobil's dividend in the long term. Image source: Getty Images. It's tough to argue that the oil business is a long-term growth business long-term in 2017. The chart below shows that ExxonMobil's revenue and net income are both in decline over the past five years -- largely because of falling oil prices -- and the future doesn't look much better. XOM Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Electric vehicles (EVs) are beginning to be viable for millions of auto consumers and automakers are planning a massive expansion in their EV fleets. According to the International Energy Agency, 2 million electric vehicles were on the road at the end of 2016. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) optimistic view of EVs has over 20 million EVs on the road in 2020 and over 200 million in 2030. Even the bearish view estimates that nearly 60 million EVs will be on the road in 2030. No matter how you look at it, EVs will be a sizable chunk of the vehicles on the road, which stands at 1.3 billion vehicles today. Each vehicle built with batteries rather than an internal combustion engine is a vehicle that's replacing a source of oil and gasoline demand. Since oil is priced at the margin (meaning the last barrel produced is really what determines price), that'll put pressure on oil prices, revenue, and earnings at ExxonMobil. Another flaw in ExxonMobil right now is that the company has been investing less in its own assets for years now. You can see below that capital expenditures are less than half of what they were five years ago, and without the reduction in spending, free cash flow would be underwater. XOM Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts. The oil and natural gas business are all about replacing production with new reserves, which requires investment in capital expenses. And ExxonMobil isn't doing that right now. Between the end of 2015 and the end of 2016 proved reserves dropped 19.3% to 19.97 billion barrels, driven by falling oil prices and the drop in investment. Eventually, the well will run dry and ExxonMobil will shrink simply because it isn't investing in projects that will generate returns in the future. I've mentioned some flaws in ExxonMobil's business, but the chart below shows that its dividend is already on thin ice. Companies want to be generating more free cash flow than they pay out in dividends, and over the last three years, ExxonMobil hasn't done that. The result is using debt to fund the dividend, which increases long-term risk for investors. XOM Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. Borrowing to keep the dividend afloat may be a reasonable idea if the future looked bright for ExxonMobil, but it doesn't. Fossil fuels are being disrupted by renewable energy and EVs and that makes this a tough dividend to bet on today. I'm so confident that ExxonMobil will underperform the market that I'm giving it an underperform call on My CAPS page. ","

Verizon added 486,000 postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter -- which is on top of 590,000 net smartphone additions in the previous quarter -- and show that even the comparable LTE networks from Verizon's competitors aren't enough to siphon off the telecom's loyal and growing customer base. Verizon is also taking steps right now to ensure that it dominates the upcoming 5G wireless revolution. The company has already conducted extensive 5G tests and rolled out 5G services in test cities this year. This is a long term opportunity for the company, and an early 5G rollout could give the carrier a leg up over its wireless rivals, just as its head start in 4G and LTE networks did in the past. The company will be dependent on its wireless business for years to come, but the telecom giant has been expanding into content as well after it bought AOL a couple of years ago and through its most recent purchase of Yahoo!. This should help diversify Verizon's revenue in the coming years -- albiet not much at first -- and shows that this long-standing telecom giant understands how to stay nimble in an increasingly competitive wireless market. Verizon's shares are currently trading at just 12 times the company's earnings, and its dividend yield continues to climb. Add to that all of the advantages mentioned, and investors are looking at a strong dividend investment for years to come. Anders Bylund (Six Flags): Theme parks are a serious business. Park operator Six Flags collects $1.3 billion of annual revenue, extracting $524 million of that top-line haul in the form of EBITDA profits and $324 of free cash flows. Seventy percent of the free cash is then paid right back to shareholders under a generous dividend program, resulting in a 4.4% dividend yield at current share prices. That shareholder-friendly dividend policy has seen its yearly payouts more than doubling in five years, rising from $1.20 per share five years ago to $2.80 today. Payout boosts have generally kept pace with the stock chart's upward march, keeping Six Flags' effective dividend yields fairly steady near the 4% level. So we're looking at a fully cash-funded payout, tied to a rising stock and a successful consumer-facing business. Six Flags has seen its revenue increase by 23% over the past five years, and the company's operating margin has never looked stronger: SIX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Looking ahead, Six Flags is exploring international expansion options in places like Dubai and China. A long-standing partnership with Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX.DL) DC Comics division should continue to benefit from Warner's renewed interest in fresh movies featuring classic DC characters such as Batman and Aquaman, both of whom are featured in several Six Flags rides. Six Flags Chairman and CEO James Reid-Anderson certainly likes the shareholder value his company offers: ""With our Amazon-proof business; strong recurring revenue; high-margin, solid growth opportunities; and attractive growing dividend, I know of no better place to invest,"" Reid-Anderson said in the third-quarter 2017 earnings call. That might be a bit over the top, but Six Flags sure looks like a solid long-term dividend play to me. Anders Bylund is a Foolish Technology and Entertainment Specialist.

    3 Dividend Stocks With Better Yields Than ExxonMobil -- The Motley Fool

  "
Jason Hall,12072017,Fool,11302017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Surprisingly enough, a huge portion of that value is derived from a very small group of companies. Of the thousands of publicly traded companies operating today, the 30 largest ones are worth almost $10 trillion -- about one-third of the entire market's value. Here is a closer look at each of the 30 biggest companies on the stock market. (Note: All market data as of Nov. 30, 2017.) Apple's iPhone X is just the latest tech marvel from the world's most valuable -- and profitable -- company. Image source: Apple. With a market capitalization of $868.8 billion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made for one of the greatest investing stories in history. And not once, but twice. Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, the early success of its Apple I, Apple II, and Macintosh computers made it a huge financial success for anyone who invested in the company after its 1980 IPO. But a number of challenges and a power struggle led to the departure of Jobs in 1985. After years of steady loss of market share to another company on this list, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple brought Jobs back in 1997, when the company was on the brink of failure. Following his return, Apple went on to develop the iMac, iPod (and subsequently iTunes), and the product that has made it the most valuable public company on Earth: the iPhone in 2007. The company is on track to ship 30 million of its new iPhone X smartphones in the current quarter. Given their price of $999 to $1,149 each, the company should command more than $30 billion in sales this quarter from this single product. Image source: Google. The parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is worth $720.8 billion. But unlike Apple, which makes a living selling high-end tech devices, Alphabet doesn't charge its users much or anything at all for most of its services. YouTube, Google search, Gmail, Google Drive cloud storage, and Documents productivity software are all free at their basic levels, while some premium services -- like additional storage and ad-free content on YouTube -- are available for a modest fee. And Alphabet uses those massive profits to invest in even more innovation. The company is a leader in self-driving vehicle technology, clean energy, and connecting more of the world to the internet. Image source: Microsoft. Like Apple, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) played a big role in the advent of affordable personal computing. But while Apple developed a fully integrated software and hardware system, Microsoft is all about software. It also was a big reason why Apple lost the home PC wars in the late 1980s, while Microsoft, with its ""Wintel"" duopoly with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) (which is also on this list) went on to command virtually the entire personal computer market for decades. However, Microsoft has all but missed out on the smartphone revolution, with its Windows Phone never really garnering much commercial success. However, this lack of success with handheld devices hasn't kept Big Softy from being wildly profitable and still a growth company. After all, the company's operating systems and other software are still critically important to running the infrastructure that powers much of the world's computing power. Microsoft has become a major player in cloud computing, a huge growth market. The company increased its market share last year, growing segment revenue 14% to $7 billion last quarter alone. Microsoft may have lost out to Apple in mobile computing, but it's not going to miss out on the cloud. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of few companies to emerge from the late 1990s tech bubble a success. And with a market cap of $560 billion, it easily qualifies as the biggest. Started by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore, Amazon sells just about everything today, and tens of millions of people subscribe to its Prime membership program for free shipping, free TV, and free movie streaming. Prime members count on Amazon as their first -- and often only -- stop for online shopping. The company's sales are growing strongly: Last quarter alone, revenue was up 34% to $44 billion. E-commerce isn't the only nascent industry Amazon is dominating, either. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the company's cloud computing provider, and Amazon commands substantial market share in this space as one of the lowest-cost providers. Last quarter, AWS generated almost $1.2 billion in operating income for Amazon, and it's set for potentially years of growth to come. Image source: Getty Images. The dominant social media platform, Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), is worth $508.9 billion. Founded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several other Harvard students in 2004, it was initially available only to fellow Harvard classmates and then a few other colleges. More than 26% of humanity regularly uses Facebook. That's a stunning figure, but it also means about three-fourths of us don't. Facebook's management would tell you that's room for growth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Led by legendary investor and CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) is worth $468.4 billion. Since Buffett took over the company 50 years ago -- it was a struggling textile manufacturer at the time -- and converted it into a holding company for his various other investments, Berkshire has created enormous wealth for tens of thousands of shareholders. Today, Berkshire is a sprawling conglomerate, with subsidiaries engaged in insurance, railways, candy making, manufacturing, electricity production, and too many other businesses to name here. Much of Berkshire's value also owes to its stock portfolio, which includes a number of the other companies on this list. At last count, Berkshire's stock holdings were worth about $180 billion, an amount that's likely to grow for years to come. Alibaba founder and chairman Jack Ma. Image source: Alibabagroup.com. Alibaba Group has rocketed up the top 30 list on expectations that its growth is just getting started. This year, the stock price has climbed 90%, even after a recent 9% drop. With China's middle class on track to crack 500 million people within a few years, Alibaba's best days could well be ahead. Image source: Johnson & Johnson. More than 130 years after its founding, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is still one of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry, as reflected by its $375 million market value. Best-known for consumer brands including Band-Aid and Tylenol, the healthcare giant is also a major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer. Last quarter, its pharmaceutical segment generated almost half of sales, while medical devices were worth twice as much revenue as the consumer-goods segment. Looking ahead, JNJ's management is banking on the need for more healthcare spending as a significant portion of the world's population gets older. Life expectancies are increasing, but it will require significant medical support to care for a growing aging population. Even after 130 years of success, the company's future still looks bright. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has its roots as far back as 1799, with the founding of one of its predecessors, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. After dozens of acquisitions and mergers in the many years since, today's JPMorgan Chase is America's biggest bank, and one of the world's largest by total assets. It's worth $360 million at recent share prices. Since the Great Recession, JPMorgan Chase, under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, has built up a fortress-like balance sheet and developed some of the most conservative lending practices in the industry. So, even as one of the biggest banks out there, it is also considered one of the safest for investors to own. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $348.6 billion, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is similar to JPMorgan Chase in that it's a product of numerous acquisitions and mergers over the years. It also has its roots in the early days of the American oil industry, directly descended from multiple companies that were part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A true integrated ""supermajor,"" ExxonMobil participates in every aspect of the oil and gas value chain, including exploration and production, distribution, refining and chemical manufacturing, and selling refined products. Last quarter, this generated $66 billion in sales and $4 billion in profits -- better than recent quarters thanks to higher oil prices. But at the same time, there are growing concerns that the advent of cheaper renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles will start making fossil fuels irrelevant sooner than many expect. Image source: Bank of America. With a market cap of $295.7 billion, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) is second to JPMorgan Chase among the most valuable U.S. banks. It's also the nation's second-biggest bank by assets as well. Unlike many of its megabank peers, Bank of America's roots aren't in New York: The company started with the founding of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904 to serve the large immigrant community in the city, which faced discrimination by other banks at the time. By the late 1920s, Bank of Italy was renamed Bank of America and Italy, and it would merge with another California-based bank named -- you guessed it -- Bank of America. Now headquartered in North Carolina, B of A was one of the banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, with two major acquisitions -- Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- leading to billions of dollars in losses, as well as tens of billions in fines and penalties related to Countrywide's mortgage practices. But today, Bank of America has emerged strong and profitable under the solid leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Wal-Mart stores. Even as e-commerce becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the pie, brick-and-mortar behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a retail giant, with a market cap of $289.8 billion. Founded by Sam Walton in the early 1960s, Wal-Mart now operates more than 11,600 stores, it sold $486 billion in merchandise last year, and it employs 2.3 million people around the world. And don't count the discount retailer out of the retail future, either. The company has aggressively invested in growing its e-commerce business, and it's paying off. Last quarter, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales increased 50%, helping drive total sales up 4.2%. The ""death of retail"" may be grossly exaggerated, at least when it comes to Wal-Mart. Image source: Wells Fargo. The third bank to make the first half of our top 30, Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) makes the list at $279.3 billion. Founded in 1852 in San Francisco early during the gold rush, it not only offered banking services, but also express service to deliver gold and other valuables quickly. And while the modern Wells Fargo is the product -- like almost every big bank -- of numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, its success has generally been a product of conservative management and lending practices that have kept it out of trouble during the numerous banking crises over the past 150-plus years. But that story may be changing. More recently, Wells' results have trailed its peers' as the effects of the fake accounts scandal play out. Last quarter, Wells was the only big bank to report a decline in its revenue, and it also saw earnings per share fall more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. In short, there's evidence that customers are avoiding Wells, and choosing instead to bank with its competitors. Over time, it's likely that this will change as long as the company can get its act together. But in the meantime, its tarnished reputation is hurting its bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $271.9 billion, Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE:RDS-A)(NYSE:RDS-B) is the second-most valuable public energy company on the U.S. market, behind only ExxonMobil. Also like ExxonMobil, Shell is an integrated supermajor, engaging in the full range of oil and gas industry businesses. But Shell is a bit different from ExxonMobil in its strategy. Following its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, management launched a strategic shift toward natural gas, where it sees greater long-term demand growth versus oil. The company has also made reducing debt -- which ballooned to over $95 billion at the peak -- and expenses a priority, as well as taking steps to increase the return on its investments. Shell has only just begun chipping away at its debt, but over the past year, profits and cash flows have surged on improved operating results, as well as higher oil prices. Shell is still exposed to many of the same risks as ExxonMobil when it comes to disruption from renewables, but that's one of the reasons management has prioritized natural gas, which produces fewer emissions and serves more industrial uses than oil. Image source: Visa. It may surprise you to know that electronic payments network giant Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), with a market cap of $249.8 billion, has only been a public company for about 10 years. Started in 1958 as part of Bank of America and called BankAmericard, it would not become a separate company until 1970, and even then, it was largely under the control of the many banks that issued BankAmericards. In 1968, it would formally change its name -- and the name of the cards issued on its network -- to Visa, but it would remain privately held until finally going public in March 2008. Visa's IPO, which was for half of the company's shares, raised $19.1 billion, making it the biggest-ever IPO at the time. Even with its massive size, Visa still has strong growth prospects. Electronic payments are only a small fraction of global transactions, but that's quickly changing as mobile computing and the global middle class converge. As a trusted name that merchants, financial institutions, and customers all count on, Visa is positioned for many more years of growth. Image source: Procter & Gamble. With a market cap of $226.8 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG) is one of the most valuable makers of branded consumer products in the world. There's a  good chance you have at least one P&G product in your home right now -- and more likely several. The company's most recognizable brands include Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Pampers, Tide, and Vicks, but that's just a handful of the more than 60 brands the company makes and sells in over 180 countries. Founded in 1837, the company has spent the past 180 years developing and acquiring products that people use in their daily lives, many of which were major innovations at the time. More recently, the company has struggled to grow, having already expanded into just about every global market, and also facing stiff competition in many of its core segments. This has led management to streamline its brands and focus more intently on its most important businesses. Since 2013, the company has reduced its brand portfolio by more than half. Sales have fallen almost $15 billion since then, but earnings have improved since bottoming out in 2015. This is helping the company continue its track record of dividend growth. P&G has increased its dividend annually for 61 straight years. Image source: Anheuser-Busch Inbev. Image source: Getty Images. The biggest and most valuable telecommunications company on the U.S. market, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is worth $224 billion. When Alexander Graham Bell founded AT&T in 1885, he probably didn't have any idea how much his company would transform over the next 130 years, while also staying remarkably the same. AT&T is still the largest provider of fixed-line telephone access in the U.S., but it's also the second-largest cellphone cellphone service provider, and the largest pay-TV operator in the U.S., through its U-Verse cable and DirecTV satellite subsidiaries. The company is looking to get even bigger, with a pending acquisition for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) in the works. However, the U.S. Department of Justice is threatening to sue over the proposed acquisition, creating some uncertainty (and a lot of drama thanks to the political implications). Image source: Getty Images. The third integrated super-major on this list, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is worth $222.6 billion. The company's roots go all the way back to 1879, with the founding of Pacific Coast Oil Co. in San Francisco and developing some of the state's earliest oil discoveries in Southern California. Coast oil would be acquired by Standard Oil in 1900 and consolidate its operations and take the Standard name in 1906. In 1911, it once again became a separate company when the federal government's antitrust suit led to the breakup of Rockefeller's Standard Oil behemoth. Following decades of growth and expansion both in the U.S. and abroad, the company finally changed its name to Chevron in 1977 as part of its move to merge six domestic operations into one. Today, Chevron is solidly profitable, but its earnings and cash flows are still far below its historical levels, as it just isn't getting the same kinds of returns on its investments at recent oil prices. However, its results have improved over the past year as oil prices have risen. Image source: Getty Images. With a market cap of $216 billion, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is the second-most valuable healthcare company and the most valuable health insurer and managed care provider in the United States. Founded in 1974 as Charter Med Incorporated, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created in 1977 as the parent company and taken public in 1984. In the 40 years since its founding, the Minnesota-based healthcare giant has steadily grown by expanding into new markets and acquiring companies in markets it wanted to enter. It also expanded its services to include prescription management and mail-order services, among others. At last count, the company insures 49 million people, and it generated more than $50 billion in revenue and $4.1 billion in operating income in its most recent quarter. Image source: Pfizer. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is the third-most valuable healthcare company on this list, with a $215.8 billion market cap. Founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in New York City in 1849, Pfizer found early success as a so-called ""fine chemicals"" maker for most of the first century of its existence. In the early 1950s, Pfizer scientists would discover and develop the antibiotic Terramycin, one of the first steps that began shifting its focus to research and development of pharmaceuticals. Over the past couple of decades, Pfizer has largely grown via acquisition of competitors including Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Wyeth in 2009, both of which have produced mixed results. Going forward, management continues to consider acquisitions to help augment its in-house R&D pipeline for new medicines. Image source: Roche. The third healthcare company in a row on this list, Switzerland-based Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY), is worth $214.5 billion. Founded in 1986 by young entrepreneur Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, Roche's roots are in the industrial manufacture of medicines. Fast-forward 130 years, and Roche is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the pharmaceutical industry, with a major pipeline of potential cancer treatments, including immunotherapies. Roche is also one of the biggest R&D spenders in the healthcare space, having spent nearly $9 billion to develop new medicines and treatments last year alone. Image source: Getty Images. With nearly 875 million subscribers on its network, China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:CHL) is easily one of the world's biggest wireless providers, and it's worth $208.9 billion. One would expect it to carry a higher value, perhaps, due to its size and potential for growth. However, China Mobile -- and its biggest competitors -- are pretty much controlled by the Chinese government, which heavily regulates the wireless market in the country. Even with that reality, China Mobile is likely to grow in value as China's middle class continues to expand and mobile use becomes more prevalent. Mobile data consumption is also likely to increase across both consumer and business customers in the coming years, and that could be a catalyst for further growth for the Chinese wireless giant. Image source: Getty Images. Founded in 1979 with the opening of two stores in metro Atlanta, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is worth $207 billion, only trailing Wal-Mart for U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers in market value. It's also very different from Wal-Mart and other general merchandise retailers, with many of the products it sells being highly resistant to infringement from e-commerce. This includes products like lumber, which carpenters and builders often prefer to hand select, as well as items customers want to choose in person, such as tile, flooring, paint, cabinets, fixtures, and other big-ticket items you have to live with every day. It's certainly played out that way. While many other big-box retailers struggle just to keep the doors open, Home Depot's sales have increased 6% so far this year, and earnings are on track to grow 14%. Image source: Intel. The other half of the ""Wintel"" duopoly with Microsoft that dominated personal computing for more than two decades, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was founded in 1968 and is worth $205.7 billion today, making it the the most valuable stand-alone semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Also like Microsoft, Intel has had middling success in mobile computing while remaining incredibly strong in the data centers that drive cloud computing and corporate infrastructures. However, there's some concern that the company's fortress-like competitive position in the data center could be weakening. If that proves to be true, and competitors start taking market share, that would seriously crimp Intel's future prospects. But with a half-century of successful innovation in microprocessors, and one of the biggest R&D budgets in the space, I wouldn't count Intel out just yet. Image source: Getty Images. Like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) is a leader in the manufacture of microprocessors, and it has a similar market value of $204.4 billion. However, it's also a very different company, since Intel designs and develops nearly all of the processors it makes, while Taiwan Semiconductor primarily contracts with so-called ""fabless"" semiconductor designers -- companies like Apple -- to manufacture chips for them. The upside is the company doesn't have to spend nearly as much on R&D -- it spent $11 billion less than Intel over the past year -- and instead focuses on high-quality, low-cost manufacturing while its customers invest in chip design. The downside? Maintaining a competitive advantage to keep those fabless chip designers coming to you for chip fabrication. It's certainly worked well for Taiwan Semiconductor, which has seen its earnings and market value grow more than 250% over the past decade, better than Intel over the same period. Image source: Verizon. With a market cap of $203.6 billion, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is the second-biggest telecommunications company in the U.S. behind AT&T. Verizon leads the U.S. wireless market with 149 million customers, and it also has one of the biggest land-line operators. The company has also increased the size of its wireline internet business in recent years and says it now has 5.8 million customers using its Fios fiber-optic internet service. But where Verizon trails AT&T is in pay-TV subscribers, a gap that's likely to grow even wider when AT&T completes its acquisition of Time Warner. Will Verizon make an acquisition of its own to narrow the gap? It's unclear, but the company is certainly investing in next-generation wireless technology, with plans to begin testing a 5G network in 2018. Image source: Getty Images. Business software specialist Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is worth $202.4 billion. Like almost every other tech company that's been successful for many years, Oracle has spent decades out-innovating (or sometimes acquiring) its disruptors. In recent years, this has included a shift to subscription models for software -- something Oracle is still working through -- and now the company is facing stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and other cloud-computing providers. Going forward, Oracle may have to prove its mettle all over again in the ever-important enterprise database segment it has dominated for years. The early results offer promise, but it's in the very early innings as the company's customers -- almost 40% of the market for enterprise database software -- begin to compare in-house systems to cloud-hosted alternatives. Image source: Citigroup. With a market cap of $198.4 billion, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is the last bank in the top 30 and the fourth-most valuable bank behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. With over 200 million global customers and 219,000 employees, Citigroup does business in 160 countries around the world. With its roots in the founding of City Bank of New York in 1812, it underwent a series of name changes over the next 160 years before finally becoming Citibank in 1976. The current Citigroup was formed when Citicorp -- Citibank's holding company -- merged with Travelers Group in 1998. Citigroup was one of the hardest-hit banks during the subprime crisis and Great Recession, with its significant exposure to bad mortgages -- both directly through its lending and through its investment in collateralized debt obligations -- which led to substantial losses, and eventually required federal government intervention to keep the bank from failing. This intervention and investment essentially wiped out investors in the company. Even after a pretty big recovery in the past decade, Citigroup investors from right before the financial crisis are still down about 75%. On the other side of the coin, anyone savvy -- or lucky -- enough to have invested in the company in March of 2009 and held their shares has seen a fourfold return on their investment. Image source: Novartis. Another Swiss pharmaceutical company on the list, Novartis AG (ADR) (NYSE:NVS) rounds out the top 30 with a market cap of $198.2 billion. But unlike Roche, which was founded more than a century ago, Novartis is the result of multiple corporate mergers, though several of its legacy companies do date back to the 1800s. However, Novartis is similar to Roche in several regards. The company spent $7.9 billion on pharmaceutical research and development last year, second only to Roche in pharmaceutical R&D investment. Much of that spending is on development of biologics and immunotherapies, two of the areas of medicine with the most promise for treatments with fewer side effects and better results. With expectations that the company will file for approval of five new molecules in 2018, Novartis's R&D investments seem to be paying off. ","

24/7 Wall St.,12072017,MarketWatch,11302017,"Published: Dec 2, 2017 9:25 a.m. ET By It’s that time of year again, the time when all the top firms that we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. start to make their stock picks and prognostications for 2018. This not only gives investors a bit of a head start on year-end portfolio reshuffling, but it also gives them a look at what the overall macro thoughts for the coming year are at the big brokerages and banks. After another stellar year for the equity markets, the economy perking up, and the potential for growth the best in years, many investors are interested in the top picks for 2018 as the market has become very expensive. A new report from Merrill Lynch unveils the firm's top picks for 2018. All are good choices for growth accounts with a degree of risk tolerance, and are investment picks for the full year, as opposed to trading ideas. This large cap refining play could have big upside for 2018. Andeavor (NYSE: ANDV) is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. The company operates seven refineries concentrated in the Western United States with throughput capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day. The company’s retail marketing system sells gasoline and diesel fuel through retail stations, as well as through third-party dealers and distributors. This segment operates a network of 2,492 retail stations under the ARCO, Shell, Exxon, Mobil, USA Gasoline, Rebel, Thrifty and Tesoro brands. The company was formerly known as Tesoro and changed its name to Andeavor in August 2017. Shareholders receive a 2.23% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $119. The Wall Street consensus price target is $122.94. The shares traded at $104.43 by the end of Friday's session. Many on Wall Street love this firm's growth potential near term and especially long term. BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) is the largest asset manager in the world, with roughly $4.9 trillion in assets under management. Its acquisitions of Merrill Lynch Investment Management (MLIM) and iShares transformed it from a fixed income manager into a multi-product and multi-channel giant, with roughly 40% of its assets under management overseas. It has leading franchises in exchange traded funds, institutional fixed income, alternatives and cash. It also operates Solutions, a leader in risk analytics. The company’s strong historical and prospective dividend growth is underpinned by the high-quality and diversified business model. Dividends have increased 18% annually over the past 10 years.

,12142017,Reuters,12072017,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said it would publish new details about how climate change could affect its business in a move aimed at appeasing critics and forestalling another proxy fight next year. The largest U.S. oil and gas producer said in a filing to U.S. securities regulators that its board agreed to provide shareholders with information on “energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future.” Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F) this century, surpassing a “tipping point” that a global climate deal aims to avert. Exxon’s statement, which came three days before the deadline for its 2018 annual meeting resolution submissions, said additional information would be released in the near future, but did not provide details. The company’s board originally opposed providing shareholders with a report outlining the potential impact of global warming on Exxon’s long-term outlook. Thomas P. DiNapoli, New York state’s comptroller, heads one the two lead sponsors of a shareholder resolution calling for Exxon to issue a climate-impact report. He called Monday’s  decision “a win for shareholders and for the company’s ability to manage risk.” However, another sponsor noted the lack of specificity in the company’s statement. “This is giving no detail,” said Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management, a co-filer of last spring’s resolution. He said Exxon’s statement “needs to be expanded to assure shareowners that they’re responsive to last year’s request.” An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing. Some 50 shareholder and climate activists earlier this year  demanded the company produce an annual report on the risks to its business from extreme climate and government policies seeking to reduce carbon emissions. The resolution was backed by 62 percent of shares voted in Exxon’s May annual meeting. Other energy companies already have begun detailing their view of climate-related risks to their businesses. Refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp recently published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the global Financial Stability Board about how to measure and respond to such risks. Members of the shareholder group had said they were considering refiling had Exxon not agreed to a detailed plan. Big investors including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group  backed the May resolution and have made climate change a priority in their governance efforts. BlackRock and Vanguard representatives last week declined to comment on their outreach to Exxon. The report will carry weight beyond the company’s next shareholder meeting. Exxon faces investigations by the Massachusetts and New York attorneys general into whether it has misled the public and investors by soft-pedaling climate change risks. Exxon has described the probes as politically motivated and intended to force it and others to change their positions on climate change. The big funds would likely cast more critical votes in 2018 if Exxon did not respond adequately to the resolution, Jason Malinowski, chief investment officer for the Seattle City Employees’ Retirement System, which has about 115,000 Exxon shares, said on Friday. Malinowski’s agency and leaders of two other pension funds separately have asked Exxon director Steven Reinemund to discuss governance reforms, such as changing pay programs and bringing in directors with “climate-competent” perspectives.

""Buy and hold"" is a great axiom on Wall Street, but it can be harder to pull off than many investors expect. That's because human nature has a bad habit of giving in to the temptations of the market. But if you step back and focus on owning great companies that pay you to own them, then you increase your chances of sticking it out through good times and bad. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) are two companies that you can buy today at good prices and collect  dividends while you hold them for at least the next decade. Integrated energy giant ExxonMobil's shares have fallen about 8% this year. Many of its peers are actually up. That suggests that something is wrong at Exxon, which simply isn't true. The company continues to chug along just like it always has. The best example of that is the fact that its dividend was raised again in the second quarter. Its streak of annual increases is up to 35 years -- an incredible record given the highly volatile nature of the energy business. Don't confuse the price of a stock with the value of what you're getting. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, no other major oil company has a dividend record that can match what Exxon has done. Most peers hit the pause button on dividend growth, or cut their dividends, after oil hit the skids in mid-2014. While dividends give you something to hold on to in the tough times, they aren't the entire story here. For example, Exxon continues to be toward the top of the pack when it comes to return on invested capital, a metric that tracks how well a company manages the money of its investors. But the company's astute financial stewardship goes beyond that. The balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry as well, with less leverage than its peers. That's true despite Exxon making a huge increase in its debt during the downturn to help support its capital investment plans and the dividend. But, even at the worst, long-term debt only made up about 15% of the capital structure. That's down to around 12% as of the third quarter, since recovering oil prices have allowed Exxon to start paring its debt levels. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. But here's the best part: Exxon's yield is a pleasing 3.7% today. And it's trading near its lowest price to tangible book value in a decade. So now looks like a good time to step aboard what remains one of the best-run companies in the energy industry. Next up is protein-focused Hormel, a food company that's probably best known for making Spam. But don't let that iconic name fool you, Hormel does a lot more than make potted meat. Its business spans the retail sector (roughly 65% of sales), the food service space (27%), and increasingly, foreign markets (5%). And it has the No. 1 or 2 position in 35 grocery categories across the entire store. Hormel makes more products than you might think. Image source: Hormel Foods Corp. Hormel's dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for over 50 consecutive years. That's a record that few public companies can match, let alone Hormel's direct peers. The stock has rebounded lately, but it's still down around 15% from its early 2016 highs. The yield is around 2%, which is toward the high end of its historical range. Concerns about shifting consumer preferences are largely to blame for the stock's troubles -- but that's an industrywide issue (Hormel's sales were down 4% in fiscal 2017). Hormel, however, is taking significant steps to keep up with the changes. Over the last few years it has sold assets that weren't living up to growth expectations (like its salt business) and bought ones that have brighter futures or complement its existing assets. The list here includes the acquisitions of Wholly Guacamole, Skippy Peanut Butter, and Columbus in the retail segment; Fontanini in the food service space; and Ceratti to expand its business into South America. It recently completed a major facility expansion in China, as well. This is not a company that's sitting still. And it has a track record of success, highlighted by that incredible dividend streak. Over the near term I would expect lingering weakness in sales and for debt levels to move higher because of the recent acquisition activity. But if you can handle that near-term uncertainty, this Dividend Aristocrat looks like it's trading at a fair price today. There's no question that Exxon and Hormel are facing headwinds, but both are managing them well -- just like they always have. Their impressive dividend streaks are all the proof you need of that. And while the stocks are down, that's actually an opportunity here for you to pick up great companies that you can own for at least the next decade. Focus on collecting all of those quarterly dividend checks (or reinvesting them) while everyone else worries about the gyrations of the market that don't change the fundamental stories for these stocks..

  "
24/7 Wall St.,12142017,MarketWatch,12072017,"Published: Dec 8, 2017 7:45 a.m. ET By Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) has been a serious Dow Jones Industrial Average laggard in 2017. The fall from grace has been monumental considering that Exxon has a market value of close to $350 billion and that it is one of the top oil and gas players in the world. It is the largest in the United States by far, and investors need to be considering how they should evaluate the company ahead. 24/7 Wall St. has recently conducted preliminary 2018 reviews for what to expect ahead. Exxon was one of five surprise Dow winners for 2018. With its shares trading at $82.50, Exxon's consensus analyst target price of $84.68 does not exactly scream ""Buy me, please!"" But if you add in Exxon’s 3.7% dividend, the implied total return forecast for the coming 12 months would only be about 6%. Investing in oil comes with many risks. The obvious one is the debate over climate change. And regardless of that debate, the trends toward higher electric and hybrid vehicle use are expected to grow more each year in the future. And nations like China and the United Kingdom have pledged to reach the end of the combustion engine out in 2040 or so. Exxon shares have been range-bound for years, and the bulk of the past five years has seen a range of $80 to $90. There are no assurances that Exxon will emerge as a top performing Dow stock in 2018. It could even trade lower, particularly if oil prices begin to head lower again. But what if all the caution and concerns can be overcome? Most investors ended up being disappointed after Exxon spent $31 billion for its acquisition of XTO Energy. This gave Exxon a deep footing into natural gas, and natural gas development has finally been coming back after years of stagnation. That has not yet been a positive for Exxon in general, even in 2017. But that may be close to a change. Natural gas production is now forecast to continue growing in the United States in 2018, led by strong export demand and utilities. This non-event valuation for XTO of the $31 billion purchase price is almost 10% of the company's entire total value. What if natural gas finally becomes a big contributor for Exxon in the years ahead? Exxon's energy outlook out to 2040 shows rising natural gas demand. The firm projected that liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports around the globe will increase by 170% from current levels by 2040. And the United States is expected to lead the share of that growth with a 30% share. Also worth noting as a development ahead is that Exxon is set to merge its refining and marketing companies into ExxonMobil Fuels &amp; Lubricants Company. That move is planned for the first quarter of 2018. 24/7 Wall St. looked over the most recent analyst calls on Exxon. it is interesting that the consensus price target of analysts from Thomson Reuters has risen of late. The current $84.68 consensus target price was up from $84.00 a month earlier and from just under $83 two months ago. That might not sound very aggressive by today's bull market standards, but when analysts start raising their price targets then that consensus estimate tends to keep rising until something changes in the overall picture. Still, Exxon has undershot its 2017 Bull/Bear Outlook. The current street-high price target for Exxon is $100. In an effort to show both sides of the coin, we have included recent analyst calls that show positive views and cautious views on Exxon. Barclays kept its price target on Exxon north of $90. The firm noted that, after a long absence from Brazil, Exxon has plunged back in and recently won 12 exploration blocks of about 2 million gross acres in September. It and Petrobras were the biggest winners. Merrill Lynch still has a Buy rating and $94 price objective. The firm's assumption assumes long-term Brent at $53 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate at $55 per barrel. In November, RBC Capital Markets lowered Exxon's target price to $85 from $90. The firm noted that the dividend may be attractive versus the market, but it argued that this is not the full picture. RBC noted that cash flow generation has been resilient but peers have seen the same. The upside risk for capital spending also was shown to be a risk to future stock buybacks. Societe Generale issued its report on Exxon after the most recent earnings report with a Buy rating and a $95 price target. While that target had been handily over $100 in years past, the firm believes that Wall Street is not giving it a fair value for the Permian and Bakken, operating and lease captures, and technical capabilities. The downstream and chemicals business was also highlighted as a positive. Early in November, HSBC lowered Exxon to Reduce from Hold. The firm favored rival Shell in its call. While CFRA (S&amp;P) only has a Hold rating, the firm noted that it sees operating earnings of $3.53 per share in 2017, improving to $3.64 in 2018. These estimates compare with 2016 operating earnings of $2.36 per share. Another caveat in evaluating Exxon and any other large integrated oil and gas companies in 2018 is something taking place a few thousand miles away. The huge Saudi Aramco IPO will bring a lot of attention, and if it is really going to be valued at $1 trillion or more, then some oil and gas investors may decide to use at least a portion of their other oil and gas stock bets as a source of funds. Again, there are no assurances that Exxon (and other oil and gas giants) will do well in 2018. But considering that its stock has been range-bound for so long and that the current consensus target is rising, some investors might want to take a closer look here. Exxon Mobil shares have a 52-week trading range of $76.05 to $93.22. ",How Exxon Mobil Could Return as a Top Dow Stock in 2018 - MarketWatch

Examples of biofuels include ethanol (often made from corn in the United States and sugarcane in Brazil), biodiesel (vegetable oils and liquid animal fats), green diesel (derived from algae and other plant sources) and biogas (methane derived from animal manure and other digested organic material). Biofuels are most useful in liquid or gas form because they are easier to transport, deliver and burn cleanly. Many in the energy industry view biofuel as vitally important to future energy production because of its clean and renewable properties. Ironically, most of the major oil companies are investing millions of dollars in advanced biofuel research. America's largest oil company, ExxonMobil, says they are funding a broad portfolio of biofuels research programs including ongoing efforts on algae as well as programs on converting alternative, non-food-based biomass feedstocks, i.e., cellulosic biomass, to advanced biofuels. They warn, however, that fundamental technology improvements and scientific breakthroughs are still necessary in both biomass optimization and the processing of biomass into viable fuels. (For more, read The Biofuels Debate Heats Up.) Individuals concerned about energy security and carbon dioxide emissions see biofuels as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. However, biofuels also have shortcomings. For example, it takes more ethanol than gasoline to produce the same amount of energy, and critics contend that ethanol use is extremely wasteful because the production of ethanol actually creates a net energy loss while also increasing food prices. Biofuels have also become a point of contention for conservation groups that argue bio-crops would go to better use as a source of food rather than fuel. Specific concerns center around the use of large amounts of arable land that are required to produce bio-crops, leading to problems such as soil erosion, deforestation, fertilizer run-off and salinity. To help mitigate the problem of large arable land use, companies like ExxonMobil are turning to water-based solutions in the form of algae production. Exxon claims that algae can be cultivated on land unsuitable for other purposes with water that can’t be used for food production. In addition to using non-arable land and not requiring the use of fresh water, algae could potentially yield greater volumes of biofuels per acre than other sources. The other advantage to using algae over other bio-sources is that the algae can be used to manufacture biofuels similar in composition to today’s transportation fuels. This would go a long way to replacing the conventional fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel used today. ",Biofuel

Rebecca Ungarino,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"A handful of names in this year's so-called dogs of the Dow collection strike some strategists as buys. The classic investment strategy works like this: investors ought to buy the 10 Dow stocks carrying the highest dividend yields, and hold on to them for one year. High dividend yields traditionally point to falling prices, thus the ""dog"" moniker. This year, the names topping the list are Verizon, IBM, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Pfizer; Merck, Coca-Cola, Cisco, Procter & Gamble and General Electric finish off the list. Notably, shares of GE have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and its dividend sits at 2.7 percent. At this juncture, Chevron and Exxon Mobil are attractive picks to David Seaburg of Cowen. ""I'm not saying rotate in massively, but I do think ... you're going to start to see some generalist money flow in there, which could keep those names elevated or actually help them work out. Good dividend, solid cash flow; those are two names that I would probably take a swing at,"" Seaburg said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Chevron has risen nearly 3 percent year to date, vastly underperforming the broader market. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil has fallen 8 percent in the same period. Procter & Gamble, which boasts a dividend yield of 3 percent, is one attractive ""dog,"" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. ""Not only has this been a dog of the Dow this year, but it's been underperforming for two years in a row,"" Maley said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation."" Indeed, while the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 20 percent this year, Procter & Gamble has risen 9 percent. ""On a technical basis, the stock is getting back up to its $194, $195 level. That's kind of its double-top from late 2014 and earlier this year. If that can break above that level, that's going to be very positive on a technical basis,"" he said. Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. Social stocks have gotten slammed, but one has survived the social media meltdown: Twitter. The charts could be setting up for an even bigger pop for the social network. The bears devoured the Apple trade this week, but one technician isn't sweating the sell-off. Should you buy the dip? Some say that's no longer the viable strategy it once was. Wells Fargo's Pravit Chintawongvanich says investors can't assume buying every dip will pay off. Small-cap stocks just entered the dreaded death cross, a technical development that traditionally suggests weakness ahead for an asset. And if history is any indication, that may signal trouble for the broader market. Apple shares just dipped into bear market territory. “I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” according to tech investor Paul Meeks. Social stocks are in a slump, but one is flying above the rest: Twitter. Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Michael Bapis of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management discuss whether the stock is a social safety trade. Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global says a North Korean attack, should one occur, isn't likely to cause significant long-term market impact.

"Tyler Crowe, Sean O'Reilly, and Reuben Gregg Brewer",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Here's something crazy to consider. In 2017, the average price per barrel of Brent crude oil -- the international benchmark price -- is up more than 15%. At the same time, though, the oil and gas industry as a whole is one of the worst-performing sectors this year. If that sounds odd to you, you aren't the only one. While there are some reasons this may be the case -- domestic crude prices are only up 6% over the same time frame -- it is still hard to imagine that the industry as a whole would suffer when the price of its most precious commodity has risen so much. With this in mind, it seems like it's a good time for investors to start digging into the oil and gas industry for possible stock ideas. So, we asked three of our investing contributors which stocks they like right now. Here's why they picked Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Transocean (NYSE:RIG). Image source: Getty Images. Sean O'Reilly (Diamondback Energy): What a difference a year makes. Last Thanksgiving, OPEC finally relented and cut production in an attempt to balance the oil market. The cartel even moved to extend production cuts through the end of 2018. This landmark reversal, made in partnership with Russia, marks a tectonic shift. The sun may be about to shine on the oil industry once again. And that makes hyperefficient oil companies like Diamondback Energy compelling investments today. Diamondback is one of the major players in the Permian Basin of West Texas. This particularly fertile geologic basin has been a favorite of the oil industry. Its proximity to the Port of Houston, and its bountiful, low-cost reserves, make it ""ground zero"" of the shale revolution. Diamondback is not only one of the most prominent owners of oil leases there, but is one of the lowest-cost producers. Over the past three years, Diamondback has cut its cash operating expenses per barrel of production by over 35%. On average, it can now produce a barrel of oil for less than $9. Diamondback Energy will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of an oil rebound. While many have been selling assets and cutting costs to survive, Diamondback has used the past four years to expand. It has done so by buying up assets and focusing on reducing costs; Diamondback could not have managed the energy downturn of the last four years any better. With its stock at just 18 times forward earnings estimates, and with industry-leading efficiency, Diamondback Energy is a fantastic oil stock to buy this December. Reuben Gregg Brewer (ExxonMobil Corporation): Shares of integrated energy giant Exxon are down around 7% so far this year. Many of its peers, on the other hand, are up for the year, some in the low double digits. But it's not like Exxon is suddenly struggling. In fact, it's doing just fine, with third-quarter earnings of $0.93 a share. But that's really par for the course; while many of Exxon's competitors were bleeding red ink during the oil downturn, this industry giant remained in the black. Now that oil prices have risen from their lows to above the $50-per-barrel level, Exxon looks like it's being left behind. However, there have been no material fundamental changes at the company, and investors seem to be overlooking growth opportunities like its efforts in the Permian Basin and offshore Guyana. In fact, at this point, Exxon is trading near its lowest ratio of price to tangible net worth in roughly a decade. Meanwhile, Exxon was one of the few oil companies to manage through the energy downturn with its streak of annual dividend increases intact (it's now up to 35 years). It also maintains one of the least leveraged balance sheets, with long-term debt at just 12% (or so) of the capital structure. And while peers are starting to close the gap with regard to return on invested capital, it's still at the high end of the group. Exxon looks cheap today, but I don't expect that to last as investors realize that this industry stalwart continues to perform at the top of its game. Brent Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts. Tyler Crowe (Transocean): Even though the oil and gas industry has been slowly recovering over the past year or so, much of the recovery has happened in North American shale. At current prices, companies can at least break even, and in some cases make a respectable return. This has spurred an uptick in spending for land drilling, and all the associated services and equipment for this particular part of the market. Outside land drilling, there hasn't been much progress. Even though some companies are learning how to develop offshore sources for less money and faster than ever before, offshore fields still tie up lots of capital over several years -- money that could go to projects that can return capital much faster. As much as this trend has held for a few years, chances are it won't last forever. The North American shale industry can't singlehandedly offset global production decline and underinvestment. Eventually, producers will find a price range where spending on offshore developments is once again lucrative. When that time comes, Transocean will be one of the companies producers turn to for an offshore drilling rig. Throughout this downturn in offshore activity, the company has undertaken an incredible fleet turnover program to shed itself of older, less capable rigs. As a result, a vast majority of Transocean's fleet is designed to handle either the deepest drilling waters or the harsh environments of the North Sea and Arctic regions. These rigs command higher service rates and higher margins, and Transocean has a lot of them ready to deploy --and the balance sheet to ride out the middle to late innings of this industry downturn. What makes Transocean's stock so compelling is the fact that it trades so cheap. At a price-to-tangible-book-value ratio of only 0.3, the market is pricing shares for pennies on the dollar of its underlying assets. Wall Street's fear here is that the anticipated recovery may never materialize. That isn't inconceivable, but the possible returns that would come from a recovery make this a high-reward stock worth a deeper dive. ","
      
    3 Top Oil Stocks to Buy in December -- The Motley Fool

Reuben Gregg Brewer,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. ""Buy and hold"" is a great axiom on Wall Street, but it can be harder to pull off than many investors expect. That's because human nature has a bad habit of giving in to the temptations of the market. But if you step back and focus on owning great companies that pay you to own them, then you increase your chances of sticking it out through good times and bad. ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Hormel Foods Corp (NYSE:HRL) are two companies that you can buy today at good prices and collect  dividends while you hold them for at least the next decade. Integrated energy giant ExxonMobil's shares have fallen about 8% this year. Many of its peers are actually up. That suggests that something is wrong at Exxon, which simply isn't true. The company continues to chug along just like it always has. The best example of that is the fact that its dividend was raised again in the second quarter. Its streak of annual increases is up to 35 years -- an incredible record given the highly volatile nature of the energy business. Don't confuse the price of a stock with the value of what you're getting. Image source: Getty Images. In fact, no other major oil company has a dividend record that can match what Exxon has done. Most peers hit the pause button on dividend growth, or cut their dividends, after oil hit the skids in mid-2014. While dividends give you something to hold on to in the tough times, they aren't the entire story here. For example, Exxon continues to be toward the top of the pack when it comes to return on invested capital, a metric that tracks how well a company manages the money of its investors. But the company's astute financial stewardship goes beyond that. The balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry as well, with less leverage than its peers. That's true despite Exxon making a huge increase in its debt during the downturn to help support its capital investment plans and the dividend. But, even at the worst, long-term debt only made up about 15% of the capital structure. That's down to around 12% as of the third quarter, since recovering oil prices have allowed Exxon to start paring its debt levels. XOM Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. But here's the best part: Exxon's yield is a pleasing 3.7% today. And it's trading near its lowest price to tangible book value in a decade. So now looks like a good time to step aboard what remains one of the best-run companies in the energy industry. Next up is protein-focused Hormel, a food company that's probably best known for making Spam. But don't let that iconic name fool you, Hormel does a lot more than make potted meat. Its business spans the retail sector (roughly 65% of sales), the food service space (27%), and increasingly, foreign markets (5%). And it has the No. 1 or 2 position in 35 grocery categories across the entire store. Hormel makes more products than you might think. Image source: Hormel Foods Corp. Hormel's dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for over 50 consecutive years. That's a record that few public companies can match, let alone Hormel's direct peers. The stock has rebounded lately, but it's still down around 15% from its early 2016 highs. The yield is around 2%, which is toward the high end of its historical range. Concerns about shifting consumer preferences are largely to blame for the stock's troubles -- but that's an industrywide issue (Hormel's sales were down 4% in fiscal 2017). Hormel, however, is taking significant steps to keep up with the changes. Over the last few years it has sold assets that weren't living up to growth expectations (like its salt business) and bought ones that have brighter futures or complement its existing assets. The list here includes the acquisitions of Wholly Guacamole, Skippy Peanut Butter, and Columbus in the retail segment; Fontanini in the food service space; and Ceratti to expand its business into South America. It recently completed a major facility expansion in China, as well. This is not a company that's sitting still. And it has a track record of success, highlighted by that incredible dividend streak. Over the near term I would expect lingering weakness in sales and for debt levels to move higher because of the recent acquisition activity. But if you can handle that near-term uncertainty, this Dividend Aristocrat looks like it's trading at a fair price today. There's no question that Exxon and Hormel are facing headwinds, but both are managing them well -- just like they always have. Their impressive dividend streaks are all the proof you need of that. And while the stocks are down, that's actually an opportunity here for you to pick up great companies that you can own for at least the next decade. Focus on collecting all of those quarterly dividend checks (or reinvesting them) while everyone else worries about the gyrations of the market that don't change the fundamental stories for these stocks..

A year ago, many energy-industry analysts and market gurus expected 2017 to be a year of massive gains for energy stocks amid an oil recovery. It didn’t turn out that way, as the price stalled in March and then again in May and June: The four-year chart gives a broad perspective: This chart shows oil price changes and the total return for the S&P 1500 energy sector over the past 12 months: On Aug. 22, Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said in his daily energy report that “the market should be expecting a big drop in crude-oil supply” because of OPEC’s production cuts and “signs that U.S. oil output from shale may be peaking.” A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a surprising increase in gasoline prices, along with an expected decline in U.S. oil supplies. After expressing doubt that U.S. gasoline supplies jumped during the Thanksgiving holiday break, Flynn said on Wednesday that “it is very disturbing that week after week we have to continue to question the accuracy of these weekly figures.” So we may once again be in for some volatility, and can expect the EIA to release revised figures.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"NEW YORK/TEPIC, Mexico (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Lawyers and advocates stepped up the fight against climate change this year by pursuing a rising number of legal cases around the world that aim to test the limits of national laws. Climate change cases numbered nearly 900 in 24 nations as of March, according to a survey by UN Environment and Columbia Law School, marking a steady increase in lawsuits filed to hold governments and companies to account over carbon pollution. They include a handful of milestone suits that charge violations of various states’ constitutions. Here are five cases whose outcomes, some expected in the coming year, could reshape the roles and responsibilities of governments and businesses in tackling climate change: - URGENDA FOUNDATION V. KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS (NETHERLANDS) This landmark case energized the climate movement in 2015 when a district court sided with the nearly 900 Dutch citizens behind it, ordering their government to cut greenhouse has emissions faster. It was “one of the most important climate change decisions ever issued”, said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law in New York. But the outcome is now being appealed and a decision could be handed down as early as 2018, said Gerrard. The Urgenda ruling remains the only one of its kind globally to declare a government’s obligation to control climate change. It did so by citing the Dutch constitution, prompting a flurry of similar complaints worldwide where plaintiffs are trying to enlist their nations’ founding principles to curb global warming. - JULIANA V. UNITED STATES (UNITED STATES) Trial in this federal suit filed by a group of 21 U.S. teenagers could begin in February 2018. Building on the precedent established by the Urgenda case, the young people from Oregon charge their government’s climate policy is inadequate and flouts their constitutional right to live in a habitable atmosphere. The case is currently stalled amid efforts by the U.S. government - fearful it will lead to a constitutional crisis - to prevent it going forward. “It’s clearly a case to watch,” said Sean Hecht, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA in California. “It would be extraordinary for a judge to take the step of holding the U.S. government responsible for this, but it’s not unthinkable,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. - LLIUYA V. RWE (GERMANY) A Peruvian farmer, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, is seeking $20,000 in damages from a large German energy utility based half-way around the world. Lliuya argues that RWE AG holds some responsibility - by emitting planet-warming gases - for the melting of glaciers and rising water level of a lake near his Andean town. Observers are calling the Lliuya suit, which is due to hear evidence in 2018, a test case of whether a company can be held financially liable for its contribution to the effects of climate change in other parts of the world. - EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION V. MAURA TRACY HEALEY (UNITED STATES) Exxon Mobil is battling attorney generals in Massachusetts and New York who are investigating the oil giant, after news reports charged in 2015 that its own scientists had found cutting fossil fuel use was needed to slow down climate change. Exxon’s case against Massachusetts’ attorney general Maura Healey and a similar one against her New York counterpart seek to derail subpoenas to obtain the company’s internal documents on climate science. “There’s a lot at stake because these companies are very concerned about potential liability,” said UCLA’s Hecht. - GREENPEACE NORDIC V. GOVERNMENT OF NORWAY (NORWAY) In another case rooted in a constitutional argument, this lawsuit charges that Norway violated the country’s constitution by letting energy firms explore for oil and gas in the Arctic Barents Sea. With a judgment expected in January, a win by Greenpeace would “re-energize similar litigations in other countries”, said Columbia Law School’s Gerrard.

Trump concluded the tweet saying: ""This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!""

Sixteen companies, including Amazon, declined to comment. Below is a table of all the companies CNBC contacted in light of the tax bill clearing Congress. It also includes companies that announced plans to raise wages or give bonuses to employees in light of the tax plan passing.

Sean Williams,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It may be hard to believe, but it's the truth: Cryptocurrencies are considerably closer to hitting $1 trillion in total value than $100 billion in value. When the year began, the combined market cap of all virtual currencies was just $17.7 billion, and bitcoin made up nearly 88% of that total. However, as of Dec. 20, the aggregate market cap of the better than 1,360 digital currencies had soared to $635 billion, representing a year-to-date increase of almost 3,500%, and bitcoin's contribution was less than 50%. By comparison, the stock market historically gains about 7% a year, inclusive of dividend reinvestment and adjusted for inflation. Cryptocurrencies have simply whupped traditional equities in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Why such bullishness, you ask? A number of catalysts have played a role in pushing virtual currencies higher. For example, the emergence of blockchain is creating a lot of buzz on Wall Street. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records all transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank. Think of it as the infrastructure that underlies digital currencies like bitcoin. Blockchain has the potential to speed up transaction settlement times, reduce transaction fees, and could be considerably more secure than current databases, just to name a few advantages. Dollar weakness has also been helpful, especially to bitcoin. A falling dollar is great news for U.S. exporters, but it's not such positive news for investors holding cash. These investors will often seek the safety of gold as a store of value, given gold's scarcity and use as a currency for more than 2,700 years. Yet some cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, have protocols that limit the number of coins that can be mined. This creates the perception of scarcity, which has pushed some investors to choose bitcoin, or other cryptos, over traditional commodities, like gold. Emotions are clearly playing a role, too. The fear of missing out, or ""FOMO,"" and watching everyone else make money has coerced both novice and experienced investors into buying cryptocurrencies. Image source: Getty Images. As you might imagine, the buzz is almost always about bitcoin -- and with good reason. It comprises nearly 46% of the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap, is the most popular virtual coin in the world, was the first tradable digital currency, and is accepted by more merchants relative to any other cryptocurrency. Yet, if you ask this investor, it's pretty far down the list of cryptocurrencies worth considering for purchase. Bitcoin, and Litecoin, for that matter, are laser-focused on growing their partnerships with merchants, and have largely ignored the enterprise-based application of their blockchains. While there's value to be had as a means of money transmittance, I personally believe that blockchain is where the bigger long-term opportunity lies. As such, I believe the following three cryptocurrencies may be worth buying over bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. There's a good reason why Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap: It has a really popular blockchain. Formed earlier this year, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance is comprised of 200 organizations that are currently testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in demo, pilot, and small-scale projects. These testers include governments, financial-service companies (which are expected to be the biggest benefactor of blockchain technology), and tech and energy companies. What makes Ethereum really stand out is its incorporation of smart contracts, which help facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. While Ethereum's blockchain is somewhat similar to that of bitcoin, these smart contract protocols allow it to move beyond currency-only applications. Its blockchain could be used to store information about an application, or can function as a multi-signature account that allows money to be spent when a certain percentage of people agree. Or in the case of integrated oil and gas giant BP (NYSE:BP), it could speed up transaction settlement times to improve energy futures trading efficiency. The one knock on Ethereum is that its coin, Ether, is almost exclusively used to cover transaction fees and doesn't have a clear path, like bitcoin, to being accepted by merchants. Again, I believe the smarter path for the Ethereum Foundation is to focus on blockchain, which is what they're doing, but it's unclear how exactly the Ether coin ties into its future. Image source: Getty Images. Another cryptocurrency that's been very impressive of late is Ripple. Its token, the XRP, has galloped higher by more than 12,000% since the year began. As with Ethereum, the buzz here is all about the company's blockchain technology. But unlike Ethereum, which is partnering with a number of industries, Ripple is focused on becoming the go-to blockchain for the financial-services industry. The company's blockchain offers the ability to rapidly proof payments and transactions, which could drastically improve the time it takes for settlement. In particular, Ripple's blockchain may offer the potential for instantaneous cross-border payments and transactions. In June 2016, Ripple announced that four major banks were testing out its distributed ledger technology in some small capacity: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, UBS, Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN), and Unicredit. But it wasn't until Nov. 2017 that Ripple really put itself on the radar. American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Banco Santander announced that they were partnering to test Ripple's blockchain in non-card cross-border payments across AmEx's FX International Payment network to U.K. Santander accounts. These payments are expected to process instantly. What's more, it looks like the XRP is going to play a vital role in the growth of Ripple's blockchain. In particular, it could be used as an intermediary in cross-border transactions that allows for one currency, say Japanese yen, to be exchanged to another currency, like the euro, instantly. Ripple is certainly worth keeping a close eye on, and it looks to be far more intriguing than bitcoin. Image source: Getty Images. Sticking with the theme that blockchain is king, one under-the-radar cryptocurrency you should be following is Stellar (formerly Stellar Lumens), and its coin, the XLM. This is a virtual currency that holds true to its name, as the XLM has been ""stellar"" this year with a 10,400% year-to-date gain. Stellar's focus is similar to that of Ripple: building financial products for transactions around the globe. In other words, it's targeting enterprise clients with high volumes of cross-border transactions. But whereas Ripple is sinking its teeth into big banks and financial-service companies, Stellar is looking at servicing multinational corporations that conduct billions in revenue outside of their home country.
