 ,04272017,Reuters,04202017,"Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P., incorporated on February 22, 2007, is a master limited partnership company. The Company provides integrated terminaling, storage, gathering and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of crude oil and liquid asphalt cement. It manages its operations through four segments: asphalt terminaling services, crude oil terminaling and storage services, crude oil pipeline services, and crude oil trucking and producer field services. Asphalt terminaling services Asphalt terminaling services segment operations generally consist of fee based activities associated with providing storage, terminaling and throughput services for asphalt product and residual fuel oil. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's 54 asphalt terminals were located in 26 states and are positioned to provide asphalt terminaling services in the market areas they serve throughout the continental United States. As of December 31, 2016, with approximately 9.6 million barrels of total asphalt product and residual fuel oil storage capacity, the Company was focused on providing its customers the ability to manage their asphalt product storage and processing and marketing activities. The Company has storage contracts or leases with customers for all of its asphalt facilities. Crude oil terminaling and storage Crude oil terminaling and storage segment operations generally consist of fee based activities associated with providing storage, terminaling, and throughput services for crude oil. The Company provides crude oil terminaling and storage services at its terminaling and storage facilities located in Oklahoma and Texas. It owned and operated an aggregate of approximately 7.4 million barrels of storage capacity, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, of this storage capacity, approximately 6.6 million barrels were located at its terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Its Cushing terminal is located within the Cushing Interchange, a crude oil marketing hub in the United States and the designated point of delivery specified in all New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil futures contracts. Its terminals had a combined capacity to receive or deliver approximately 10 million barrels of crude oil per month, as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, it also owned approximately 50 acres of additional land within the Cushing Interchange, where it can develop additional storage capacity. Crude oil pipeline services Crude oil pipeline services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activity associated with transporting crude oil products on pipelines. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned and operated two pipeline systems, the Mid-Continent system and the East Texas system, collectively consisting of approximately 760 miles of pipelines that gather crude oil for its customers and transport it to refiners, to common carrier pipelines for ultimate delivery to refiners or to terminaling and storage facilities owned by the Company and others. Its pipeline system located in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, referred as the Mid-Continent system, had a combined length of approximately 550 miles, as of December 31, 2016. Its second pipeline gathering and transportation system located in East Texas, referred to as the East Texas system, consisted of approximately 210 miles of tariff-regulated crude oil gathering pipeline, as of December 31, 2016. Crude oil trucking and producer field services Crude oil trucking and producer field services segment operations generally consist of fee-based activity associated with transporting crude oil products on trucks. As of December 31, 2016, in addition to its pipelines, the Company used its approximately 125 owned or leased tanker trucks to gather crude oil in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Colorado for its customers at remote wellhead locations generally not connected to pipeline and gathering systems and transport the crude oil to aggregation points and storage facilities located along pipeline gathering and transportation systems. In connection with its gathering services, the Company also provides a number of producer field services, ranging from gathering condensates from natural gas producers to hauling production waste water to disposal wells.

Fred Imbert,04272017,CNBC,04202017,"U.S. equities soared on Monday as investors cheered the results of the first round in the French presidential election. ""The market really seemed to like"" the election outcome, said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. ""It really surprised me because the other candidate is Le Pen and she's the sleeper candidate."" The Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 200 points, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 popped about 1 percent, with financials surging more than 2 percent to lead advancers. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) and the Regional Banking ETF (KRE) both rose more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq composite posted record highs on an intraday and closing basis, rising more than 1 percent. Early results from the French election showed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen advancing to a presidential runoff. Far-right candidate Le Pen and centrist Macron were largely expected to pull ahead in the first round of the French contest. The two had led most of the polls leading up to the election. Le Pen and Macron will face off again on May 7. Most polls show Macron easily beating Le Pen in the second round. ""While I don't believe the US stock market was worried whatsoever about the French election in terms of its pricing and recent action ... it's clear that we dodged a bullet with the high likelihood of a Macron Presidency,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. European stock markets skyrocketed across the board, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index popping about 2 percent. The French CAC 40 rose 4.14 percent and hit a nine-year high. The euro also rose sharply against most major currencies. The common currency briefly broke above $1.09 against the U.S. dollar and last traded around 1.3 percent higher at $1.087. Macron ""is the prohibitive favorite to win the presidency in two weeks thereby leaving far too little time for his challenger to make up any significant ground,"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. ""Although the outcome hardly qualifies as a surprise, investors breathed a huge sigh of relief."" U.S. stock futures rose more than 1 percent in the premarket. ""We've certainly seen the French election give risk assets a boost,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets. ""But now you're seeing the narrative shift almost immediately to the possibility of a government shutdown."" That said, investors are also staring down the barrel of a potential government shutdown. Government funding will end Friday unless Congress can agree on at least a temporary funding resolution. The last time the government shut down was Oct. 1 through 16, 2013. During that time, the S&P 500 rose about 1.6 percent, but not without some volatility. The index moved more than 1 percent three times in that time period. ""There's a lot of anxiety over a government shutdown. One would hope we learned from the last time we went through this,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. The possibility of a shutdown comes as President Donald Trump is about to conclude his first 100 days in office. On Monday, Dow Jones reported that Trump ordered aides to put together a tax plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Expectations of tax reform have been one of the pillars of the stock market's postelection. Wall Street also braced itself for a busy week of earnings. About 200 S&P components are set to report this week, including Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft and 3M. Of the 95 S&P 500 companies that have reported as of Monday morning, 77 percent exceeded earnings expectations, according to data from The Earnings Scout. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 216.13 points, or 1.05 percent, to close at 20,763.89, with JPMorgan Chase outperforming and Nike the top decliners. The S&P 500 gained 25.46 points, or 1.08 percent, to end at 2,374.15, with financials leading nine sectors higher and real estate and telecommunications lagging. The Nasdaq advanced 73.30 points, or 1.24 percent, to close at 5,983.82. About three stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 907.07 million and a composite volume of 3.647 billion at the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 10.9, down 25.6 percent.

Sean Williams,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is one of the America's oldest stock indexes, and it's easily the country's most iconic. It's comprised of 30 huge multinational corporations, all of which have demonstrated a penchant for creating shareholder value over the long run. Image source: Getty Images. For example, conglomerate General Electric is the sixth-largest company represented in the Dow, with a market cap of roughly $260 billion. But its share price is less than $30. Based on the current Dow divisor, which translates the share prices of Dow components into the point value that we follow as investors, GE's share price contributes just 202 of the Dow's 20,548 points, the closing value as of Friday, April 21. That's not even a full 1%. Yet, a company we'll be discussing in a moment that has just 30% of the market cap of GE also has seven times its influence in the Dow, all because of share price. In fact, through Friday, the Dow would be 308 points higher if the following three companies were merely flat for the year instead of down between 9% and 11%. Though it doesn't happen often, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed Wall Street's expectations by a wide margin in the first quarter, and that's the primary reason it's shaved nearly 155 points off the Dow year to date. It's also the aforementioned company that has seven times as much influence on the Dow as GE based solely on its share price. Image source: Getty Images. For the first quarter, Goldman wound up reporting $5.15 per share in EPS on $8.03 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Wall Street was looking for $420 million more in revenue and $0.16 more in earnings per share. Goldman attributed its subpar results to weakness in certain market segments. For instance, even though investment banking revenue scorched higher by 16% year over year, revenue from fixed income was flat, while equity revenue dipped 6% on account of weaker volumes in the United States. The low interest rate environment continues to hold back Goldman Sachs, which is listed as a bank in name, but is really an investment institution by practice. The good news is that at least the Federal Reserve is in the midst of tightening monetary policy, albeit slowly. As rates rise, investor demand for fixed-income assets will likely improve as well. This should reduce market volatility and give the king of bonds, Goldman Sachs, some healthy profits. But it's going to take time before the bond market is a boon once again for Goldman Sachs. In the interim, it's been quite the drag on the Dow in 2017. Integrated oil and gas companies have regularly taken it on the chin over the past three years. Surprisingly, though, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has held up better than many of its peers. Its geographic diversity and ability to cut costs probably played a key role in its ability to withstand sinking crude oil prices. Image source: Getty Images. However, in 2017 Chevron has been notably weaker. On a pure percentage basis, Chevron is the worst-performing stock in the Dow year to date, and it's removed almost 88 Dow points. The failure of crude prices to move higher is one reason Chevron is struggling. Despite cuts from OPEC that were expected to reduce supply and help buoy crude prices, U.S. crude and gasoline inventories hit an all-time record high in mid-February. This picture paints the need for more production cuts in the future, and more importantly, shows there is no quick fix for crude oil prices. The other issue for Chevron is that its fourth-quarter earnings results, released earlier this year, weren't very encouraging. Despite the company's $415 million in net income during Q4 2016, there were a handful of disappointments. For instance, Chevron's operating cash flow is still not high enough to cover the costs of paying out its dividend. Chevron has admittedly worked hard to become a Dividend Aristocrat (i.e., a company that's increased its payout for 25 or more consecutive years) and likely doesn't want to give up that title, but it's being forced to issue debt to cover a portion of its payouts at the moment. Additionally, the company's U.S. downstream operations produced no earnings as a result of a 21% decline in per-day output, which Chevron blamed on planned turnaround activity at its refinery in Richmond, California. The good news for investors is that Chevron still has plenty of cost-cutting channels left, as well as numerous projects that are poised to boost production over the long term. However, an ongoing crude supply glut is a problem that isn't likely to be resolved anytime soon. Finally, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is in much the same boat as Chevron. Its stock has held up far better than many of its peers, but rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories clearly have investors concerned. This year hasn't been so kind to big oil stocks, with ExxonMobil removing more than 65 points from the Dow in 2017. Image source: Pixabay. Though ExxonMobil's fourth-quarter report was a bit more upbeat than Chevron's -- after all, it was able to cover its dividend payouts with cash flow generated from operations and asset sales -- it still came with some clear downsides. For instance, ExxonMobil wound up taking an impairment charge of about $2 billion in its U.S. upstream segment that was tied to undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains. The company also saw its full-year 2016 earnings hit by weaker refining margins, although this was a sectorwide issue last year. And, for those shareholders who've become accustomed to ExxonMobil being exceptionally generous with share buybacks, there's been a notable decline in the number of shares it's repurchasing. Like Chevron, ExxonMobil has the ability to reduce its expenditures to account for weakened demand or modestly lower commodity prices. Its Q4 2016 capital expenditures were down 35% from the prior-year quarter, to $4.8 billion. These are the types of steep cuts that may be needed if ExxonMobil wants to keep its healthy dividend firmly in place. ExxonMobil has ample projects underway to boost production in the years to come, but without oil industry dynamics favoring the company, it could be tough sledding in 2017. ","

Microsoft seems to hold similar values, as the company notes that it donates nearly $2 million per day in cash and equipment. Its philosophy is that technology can help humankind overcome some of the greatest challenges it faces.

Taylor Muckerman and Sean O'Reilly,04272017,Fool,04202017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Fracking is where it's at for U.S. oil production, but it's more than a little complicated. Also, the hosts look into the sudden seat change at Arconic (NYSE:ARNC), where CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has been abruptly ousted from his position by investment-management company Elliott Management. A full transcript follows the video. Taylor Muckerman: Sporting my red today, got a sweep yesterday, first series win. O'Reilly: You feeling good? Muckerman: Better. O'Reilly: Very good. I'm a Cleveland Indians fan. We're not going to talk about last year. Muckerman: I would talk about last year. You lost in Game 7, but you still went to the World Series. O'Reilly: How far did you guys get? Muckerman: Oh, funny. That's why I'm saying, I would want to talk about last year if I was you. O'Reilly: Thank you. If I were you? We need a couple of those editors from upstairs. Muckerman: Yeah, hold up paper on the glass. ""You said that wrong!"" O'Reilly: Use your commas! So, on today's show, we're going to walk our Foolish listeners through the fracking process. I know that sounds really attractive, doesn't it? Muckerman: We use the word a lot, but we haven't ever really described it. O'Reilly: That's true. And we'll, of course, mention a few interesting companies along the way, maybe some cool fracking sand companies. Muckerman: If our listeners ask politely. O'Reilly: We should have a chat sometime, ""Tweet at us right now if you want ... "" Muckerman: We could. We do live chats with our members. We could do a live stream using Slido. O'Reilly: Could we use Slido? Muckerman: Yeah, you just have to throw a password over the podcast, and if people listen to it they get treated with the password. Muckerman: No, then people who don't listen every week wouldn't be able to figure it out. O'Reilly: Yeah, OK. So we'll walk through the fracking process. But first, we have to briefly talk about what's going on with Arconic. Basically, this week, the sudden ouster of its CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. Arconic is the lightweight metals and engineering manufacturer. It's the successor -- Muckerman: Well, not successor, because Alcoa (NYSE:AA) still exists. O'Reilly: It spun off the original aluminum production operations, and this is the advanced stuff. So Alcoa took the name. Muckerman: Alcoa kept the aluminum production, and they spun off the aluminum products division into Arconic. O'Reilly: Yeah. It was interesting to me, because in every press release I've ever seen for this, or analysis, Arconic is not mentioned as a spinoff. It's just, ""We're separating, and that's it."" Muckerman: Yeah, I guess maybe not a spinoff, technically. O'Reilly: But bottom line, that's just semantics to this point. This happened about six months ago. The guy that steered Arconic through this process of becoming an individual company was, again, CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. Total surprise -- it was announced on April 17 that Kleinfeld has been forced out by investment manager Elliott Management. This is actually where it gets even weirder. Arconic said that Mr. Kleinfeld's exit came after he sent an unauthorized letter to Elliott Management, that Arconic's board of directors said showed poor judgement. The company then said that Mr. Kleinfeld is stepping down by mutual agreement. I don't know what was in this letter. That sounds awesome. If somebody knows, tweet at me, I guess. Elliott said in a statement that the letter from Mr. Kleinfeld ""read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of Elliott Management based on completely false insinuations, a threat that we took seriously and about which we immediately and privately informed the board."" Whoa. Muckerman: Yeah, I would believe them if they didn't already want him out of there for over a year. This is just their excuse. O'Reilly: That's the final cap on this whole -- Muckerman: They were probably poking the bear for a year, and he finally woke up from hibernation. O'Reilly: Arconic is going to have a shareholder meeting on May 16, and they had it on the docket to get him out. That letter, I want to know what's in that letter. That sounds insane, from a professional CEO of a large corporation. Muckerman: Yeah. If you're a shareholder of Alcoa -- because he's been the CEO of Alcoa before the split -- he pushed back against the split in 2012 and 2013, when the price of commodities started to fall, eventually succumbing to investors' demands, and successfully overseeing the split and then taking control as the CEO of Arconic. He's a visionary. He has long-term visions for Arconic, not these near-term visions that Elliott Management has. If you look at his success at Alcoa and Arconic now as a businessman and a relationship man with their customers, Boeing was going to go all composites, they were going to completely eliminate the aluminum products that they used from Alcoa and now Arconic. He had the CEO come to their plant, they hashed it out, and they proved that they needed to remain an Arconic customer. And it's one of their biggest contracts. And then you see the CEOs of Airbus, on top of Boeing, United Technologies, and to [General Electric] Aviation all voicing their support for Klaus Kleinfeld. But Elliott Management, they have some ulterior motives, some short-term motives, I'm sure. O'Reilly: This is not news, yeah. Muckerman: The stock did pop a little bit, but all these reports you see about his track record in the market for Alcoa, all say, ""Oh, this stock's done so poorly since he's been there!"" But they never mention the fact that the price of aluminum has also done quite poorly since he was CEO. Muckerman: Using Arconic's products. As Fools, we appreciate that, and as Fools, we don't appreciate, at least I don't appreciate, what happened. I'm going to keep my eye on him and see where he ends up. If he doesn't choose to retire, I think somebody is going to want him on their board, or in their C-suite. I'd be interested which company that is. Hopefully they're public so I can follow along. O'Reilly: We've been doing this for a year and a half together. We've talked a lot about fracking. It's kind of all we talk about. Muckerman: Well, it's what's disrupted the industry over the last decade or so, and it's what put American oil and natural gas back on the map. O'Reilly: I have a good friend who's a petroleum geologist. I remember when he was in school 10 years ago, he gave a presentation about this, and I happened to be on campus. I was just passing through. He was talking about this and how revolutionary it was. He was talking about -- we're going to talk about it in a second -- drilling sideways and all this stuff. It was a big deal, and we hadn't been able to do that until recently. So, first and foremost, we need to clarify some terms. Fracking is actually what happens after a well is drilled. We've been drilling oil wells for over a hundred years. Muckerman: The technology there has definitely improved, but it's not what fracking is. O'Reilly: Have you ever been to Drake's Well, Pa.? Muckerman: I haven't. That's the original, right? O'Reilly: It's so anticlimatic. Muckerman: Yeah, I'm sure. Kind of like the geyser in Yellowstone. Whatever, dude. O'Reilly: The actual well drilling, which, again, going down, we can now go 360 degrees around. That immediately makes any given oil well more valuable. You used to just drill a hole and oil would come up, and that would be it. Muckerman: And you would have to go straight down. But we're going up to 10,000, maybe even a little further down now. O'Reilly: I saw this graphic, and they had Empire State Buildings down. Muckerman: Yeah, multiple Empire State Buildings. O'Reilly: Yeah, they had, like, five. Muckerman: We can go over a mile horizontally once we're a couple miles below the surface. We're not just going straight horizontal anymore. We have directional drilling, where it's basically like a video game -- O'Reilly: Does the bit do any dances, like a shimmy-shimmy? O'Reilly: Do you think they saw the movie and thought, ""We need to do that""? Muckerman: Yeah. I mean, it's not doing spirals. It has to have some sort of straight direction to it, because they have to have the casings and cement to fortify it. But yeah, we're not just going at a 90-degree angle anymore. O'Reilly: Correct me, but, basically, when they're doing all these drills and the fracking, which we're going to touch upon in a second, a lot of what they do is to basically make sure the hole stays in place and together. Muckerman: Yeah, a lot of pipe and a lot of cement go into this process. The first thousand or so feet, I don't know, it depends on the water level, but they have to protect them first and foremost. O'Reilly: And that gets cased in cement. Muckerman: It does. They lower the piping down, and before they drill any further, they force cement down the hole, and wraps around the pipe at the bottom, and then upfills, and once it's cemented then they can use the drill bit to drill back through the hardened cement, and then they can continue drilling down to the oil and natural gas. First and foremost, they're protecting the water level. O'Reilly: So they're making a thousand-foot straw out of cement. Muckerman: The whole thing is a straw, but that's the most heavily protected part of the straw. O'Reilly: OK, and that's so things don't collapse -- Muckerman: Well, that and so we don't mess up the water table. O'Reilly: Important also. Muckerman: Yeah, so the oil and natural gas aren't seeping out into the water table through cracks in the casings. Basically, what you can imagine is, the top of this hole has the widest casing, and then they just put smaller and smaller casings down through, so it's kind of like a police baton when they snap it out. O'Reilly: Right, or an inverted skyscraper. That's actually a good analogy, the baton. Respect. So, hydraulic fracturing is the use of -- this is what I got offline -- fluid and material to create and restore small fractures and rock formations. One that hopefully has oil and natural gas in it, of course. Muckerman: Yes, you would hope. There's companies out there that help them arrive at that conclusion. O'Reilly: Right. So, historically, you find these geologic formations, and we know the types of rock that usually have reservoirs of oil. That's easy. Muckerman: Yeah, that's called conventional oil. Muckerman: Big basins, generally long-lasting wells. O'Reilly: Right. That's what Saudi Arabia has with their Ghawar Field; that's what we're talking about here. This is going down there thousands of feet, and there's oil stuck between the tiniest of rocks. It's actually crazy to think about, that we're getting it out. Muckerman: Yeah, it's thin layers that are separated by sediment and rock. So they drop a wire line into these drilled wells and send an electrical charge through this wire that then creates, like you said, a small explosion, and they do it over stages. O'Reilly: Are you saying they're fracturing the rock, Taylor? Muckerman: They are, they're fracturing the rock. Through the steel casing, and then through the rock, with pellets and things that diffuse reaction. They do it in stages. That's one reason why we're producing more oil now, because we're being able to tighten the spacing, so we can have more stages per well. They frack, they plug, they frack, they plug, they frack, they plug. Then, once they've fracked all the stages, they remove the plugs, and then they start the process of forcing the fluids and proppants down into the fractures. O'Reilly: This is like putting a man on the moon. This is really complex. Muckerman: Maybe even more complicated. Muckerman: Yeah, now you're just walking around with several of those in your pocket. O'Reilly: Yeah. We've covered a lot of ground here. What companies -- Muckerman: Yeah, there's companies in every stage of this. O'Reilly: If I have some acreage in the Delaware basin over there in West Texas, one, I'm obviously a millionaire, automatically. But do I sell the land to EOG Resources or Pioneer [Natural Resources] and call it a day? Or can I hire a company to just do the fracking for me? Muckerman: EOG and the exploration and production companies aren't necessarily buying the land. Maybe sometimes they do, but they're leasing it. Then, as an acreage holder, you get lease payments, and you probably negotiate some royalties on top of that. O'Reilly: So that's what I would do, theoretically. Muckerman: Yeah, theoretically, yeah. We're not going to talk about the producers today, because those are some of the bigger names we mention all the time, because they're the folks that are most directly impacted by the price of oil. But yeah, you're calling companies, A, you can call a company that can do pretty much everything, which is going to be a Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, or Weatherford -- those are the ExxonMobil of the drilling and fracking world. They do everything. O'Reilly: But they do not own or produce or sell the oil. Muckerman: They don't. Maybe there's some kind of way that they can negotiate a contract with royalties, but no, for the most part, you're buying a stock in these companies because they're going to do the dirty work. O'Reilly: And then they get a day rate, and that's it. Muckerman: They get a day rate for the rigs, and then for all the equipment they use, and rental prices and things like that, yeah. O'Reilly: So all along, they were giving oil companies a break on these day rates and stuff. But now, they're like, ""All right, now that oil is up, we need to ... "" Muckerman: They have to eat, too. So you get them to provide some of the equipment to do the drilling, to do the fracking, to do the completing. And then once the oil starts flowing, they throw the wellhead on it, sometimes call it a Christmas tree because that's what it looks like when it's sitting on top of the well. Then, once the oil is producing -- O'Reilly: On to the next one. Muckerman: They clean their hands with some of the orange automotive soap that really degreases everything, and then they move on to the next one. Another reason why we're producing and drilling so much more efficiently is because we have what we call pad drilling now, where they basically put some of these rigs on tracks, and without disassembling them like they used to have to do, they used to have to take apart the drilling rig every single time. O'Reilly: I'm picturing a crane. Muckerman: It's like a bulldozer or a tank. It's basically on a track. It's called pad drilling, where they can slide it over to the next well site. Disassembling these rigs was the bulk of the time these companies were spending on actual drilling. O'Reilly: You can imagine it's complex. Muckerman: Yeah, exactly. And if one bolt is wrong, you're screwed. O'Reilly: Let's talk a bit about water and sand. Muckerman: Water and sand make up about 98%-99% of what you're forcing down there, and then you have some chemical additives that are used for -- O'Reilly: Like slickwater solutions, whatever that is. Muckerman: -- to reduce the growth of bacteria, which can be dangerous, releasing gases. It also provides a bit more of a fluid environment. Yeah, predominantly water and frack sand and some sort of proppant, depending on what kind of well you're drilling. O'Reilly: There are companies like U.S. Silica and Hi-Crush Partners that literally just make the sand for these guys. Muckerman: Yeah. U.S. Silica is not just sand. I don't even know if they do just strictly sand. O'Reilly: Silica implies some kind of glass, too. Muckerman: Yeah, they can actually create a very specific proppant for a specific well. O'Reilly: Based upon the geologic properties that are downstairs. Muckerman: Yeah. And a company like Core Labs can tell you what kind of proppant might work best, because they're a core and fluid analysis company that's used by pretty much everybody in the business. O'Reilly: And you can send them a core to their lab and make them tell you stuff. Muckerman: You can send it to them; they can come get it for you. We visited them a couple years ago, and they were telling us that companies even as big as Exxon and Chevron were outsourcing their core sample analysis to Core Labs because they did it so much better than everybody else. But they've been hurt recently because their future was very heavily reliant on deepwater, so once that comes around, maybe that's another company to look at. But you analyze the core sample, and then you can determine your water to sand, water to proppant chemical ratio that's specific for each individual well. Again, technology helping us produce more oil and natural gas per individual well. O'Reilly: All this stuff, over the last five years, I assume they've been getting better at what we just described even in just the last five years and that's kind of what we're talking about with these companies lowering their cost of production even since 2012. Muckerman: But you look at these companies using much more sand -- so, not only the companies you mentioned, but CARBO Ceramics as well, and a couple smaller ones, Fairmount Santrol Holdings and Emerge Energy Services, all companies you can look at on the proppant side of the business -- as these companies use more and more proppants, demand should drive the price up, as long as they don't create too much supply too soon. O'Reilly: Right. Before we finish up here, what's the flushing stage? It's just using water to flush out the well when you're done? Muckerman: Basically, yeah. Clean up on aisle oil. But a lot of these companies now, the wells aren't being cleaned out as quickly because they're going back and using carbon dioxide to go back in and try to force more oil out. O'Reilly: And that's usually on really old wells, as I understand. Muckerman: Yeah, really old wells. They're even going back and trying to fracture conventionally drilled wells -- O'Reilly: From 100 years ago, I hear, sometimes. Muckerman: You're not getting nearly 100% of the oil and natural gas out of these wells. I would be surprised if some of these wells or even reaching 70% or 80%. O'Reilly: The conventional wells? Muckerman: Yeah. And fracking wells are leaving even more, percentage-wise, in the ground than conventional. You're going back and trying to use carbon dioxide, more water flowing through these, and refracking things in different stages after they've exhausted the conventional resource. There's a lot of activity going on -- not only those companies that we've mentioned, but National Oilwell Varco, huge equipment supplier. If you're looking at the drilling rigs, Nabors is the largest land drilling rig provider in the United States. O'Reilly: Distribution NOW gets these guys all the parts that they need when things happen. Muckerman: Helmerich & Payne is a very widely respected rig operator and rig manufacturer. Then, Patterson-UTI as well. Different stages. If you want the whole thing outside of the proppants, look at a Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, or Weatherford. If you want to get more specific, you can go proppants with the companies we mentioned -- U.S. Silica, Hi-Crush Partners, CARBO Ceramics, and those other smaller ones. Then, if you want the rig providers and operators, Helmerich & Payne, Patterson-UTI, and Nabors. They do other things, but that's the bread and butter of those three companies, the rig and drilling side of it. O'Reilly: Cool. Thanks for your thoughts, Mr. Muckerman. Muckerman: Yeah, I appreciate it. It's very important, it's going on all over the United States and the world, eventually, on the same scale that we have here. O'Reilly: Watch out. Muckerman: Yeah, you can definitely not invest in the exploration and production companies and still profit from fracking. ","

                                   have been caught in a yearslong slump for oil-futures prices as demand has failed to match rising production. Prices have stalled around the $50-a-barrel mark, a price threshold where it may make sense to drill in some areas, like West Texas’ Permian Basin, but not in others. Related: In the midst of an oil-price slump, one area in Texas is enjoying a bit of a boom During calls with analysts following results, Wall Street will listen closely for clues about how Exxon and Chevron plan to calibrate growth plans against that price background. Chevron’s growth plans are generally viewed as solid, but Wall Street is bound to question its ability to execute ongoing and future projects, following delays that plagued some of its major developments. For Exxon, the focus will likely be where the company will go next. Exxon recently bought assets in the Permian Basin, where it doubled its acreage, and its deal to buy natural-gas company InterOil Corp. recently closed. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts polled by FactSet expect Exxon to report first-quarter adjusted earnings of 85 cents a share, which would compare with adjusted earnings of 43 cents a share in the first quarter of 2016. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has a consensus estimate of 91 cents a share. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Chevron to report adjusted earnings of 86 cents a share, versus an adjusted loss of 22 cents a share in the year-ago period. The Estimize consensus for Chevron’s adjusted earnings is 89 cents a share. Revenue: The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Exxon to report revenue of $66.3 billion, which would compare with revenue of $48.7 billion a year ago. The forecast for Chevron is $34.9 billion, from a reported $23.6 billion in the year-ago period. Stock price: Both stocks have underperformed the broader market benchmark in 2017, and the picture is almost as dire in a 12-month span. Exxon and Chevron each have lost 9% so far this year, which compares with gains of 7% for the S&P 500 index. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                            
                                    SPX, -0.15% Chevron lags behind less on a 12-month basis, with the stock up 4.6% to the S&P’s 14% gain in the period. Exxon, however, has lost more than 6% in the past 12 months. Other issues: Between the two majors, analysts usually pick Chevron over Exxon, usually citing a more favorable cash flow position for Chevron. Analysts at Goldman Sachs earlier this month picked Chevron as one of their top picks among energy companies on the strength of the company’s free cash flow, dividend yield, and potential for its Permian Basin holdings. For analysts at Simmons & Co., the Street’s cash-flow estimates for both companies may be too optimistic. Cash flow delivery for both names “is at risk of disappointing,” the Simmons analysts said. “This appears particularly true for (Chevron), as full year 2017 cash flow estimates appear optimistic relative to reality,” they said. Chevron is at a free cash flow “inflection,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a separate note. “Given historical track record of execution issues investors are still skeptical of whether (Chevron) can meet consensus growth expectations, particularly in Australia,” where the company is developing massive natural-gas projects. Chevron has recently sold oil and gas fields in Bangladesh, and proceeds could be deployed in more profitable core-areas such as the Permian, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said in a recent note. For Exxon, besides updates on its recent deals, the Goldman Sachs analysts said they would look for the company’s views on longer-term growth plans, particularly in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Iraq and Russia, they said. The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week Exxon and other U.S. companies will not receive waivers to resume Russian ventures. Exxon had sought such an exemption to revive its joint venture with state-controlled PAO Rosneft, The Wall Street Journal had reported.

,05042017,Reuters,04272017,"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended flat on Thursday as a steep fall for the energy sector countered some solid earnings reports, with major stock indexes closing little changed after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a healthcare overhaul. The House on Thursday afternoon narrowly voted to repeal major portions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan, sending it to the Senate for consideration. The bill’s passage comes after House Republicans pulled healthcare legislation earlier this year in a setback, raising questions among investors about President Donald Trump’s ability to enact his agenda. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 11.7 percent since Trump’s election, fueled by his plans for tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. “The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “I don’t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue,” Meckler said. “I think they’re really focused on the tax plan. If they couldn’t pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,951.47, the S&P 500 gained 1.39 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,389.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.79 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,075.34. The energy sector dropped 1.9 percent, easily the worst performing group. Exxon Mobil’s 1.3-percent decline and Chevron’s 1.8-percent drop weighed on the S&P. Oil prices tumbled about 5 percent on signs that OPEC and other producing countries would not take more drastic steps to reduce the world’s stubbornly persistent glut of crude. Investors also were digesting the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday. The central bank left rates unchanged but downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth while emphasizing the strong labor market, in a sign it was still on track for two more rate rises this year. Focus was turning to Friday’s U.S. employment report as the next gauge of the economy and labor market. Data on Thursday showed new applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell sharply last week and the number of Americans on unemployment rolls hit a 17-year low. “It’s going to be particularly important to see if we get the expected rebound in job gains,” given that the Fed discounted the first quarter growth weakness because of a projected recovery, said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. “Now the market is going to be watching very carefully to see whether or not they get that confirming data that would mean we will get a June rate increase,” Gayle said. In corporate news, Tesla fell 5 percent after the electric automaker’s quarterly net loss widened. In the healthcare sector, Regeneron rose 6.7 percent and Zoetis rose 5.9 percent after their respective results. Earnings season has come in generally above expectations, encouraging investors. First-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have increased 14.8 percent, the strongest since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 77 new lows. About 7.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. ","

You learn the oil company is doing all sorts of wonderful things to protect the planet. Somewhere deep in the pit of your stomach this incongruence registers – oil company, environmental protection – that can't be right, can it? But it's so hard to disbelieve. Look at those plants, the water, the beard. Maybe an oil company can change? Maybe it does care about the environment? No, it can't. No, it doesn't. The truth has just been ""greenwashed."" Greenwashing is an advertising and public relations spin designed to make a corporation look more environmentally friendly than it actually is. The practice has become so popular that the term even made it into the tenth edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. Corporate greenwashing is an issue that everyone should be mindful of. No one wants to be lied to, and lies that affect the environment – and possibly human health and survival – are particularly heinous. In a world where going green means big money to corporations, it's not surprising that some cut corners. In this article we'll explore why corporations greenwash their activities, provide some prime examples of greenwashing and show you what you can do to ensure that you are not the latest greenwashing casualty. Asking a corporation to go green solely on the basis of ethics is a bit like asking a shark to stop eating because the other fish are getting upset. It is simply unequipped to make a moral choice. Sharks eat fish; corporations make money – it's what they do. Increasing sales of their goods and services, cutting costs and increasing efficiency all play a role in making a company – and its shareholders – more cash. The interests of the shareholders always come first – always. Corporations, and by extension corporate executives, are legally bound to make as much money for their shareholders as possible. This isn't a bad thing. It's a system of rules that guarantees that when you invest your money into a company, you can be confident that the people running it will do their best to ensure you see a return on your investment. This is where another concept of the corporate world comes into play: cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis tells corporate executives that sometimes it's cheaper (and therefore better) to say you are going green, than to actually go green. Overall, people like green companies. Being perceived as a friend of the environment can mean big money in a world where perception is reality. If lying has the same result as telling the truth, and costs less money, corporate executives are duty bound to do a little greenwashing. (To read about how going green benefits companies, read For Companies, Green Is The New Black.) If you go to any corporation's website you are bound to find a ""corporate responsibility statement"" or ""sustainability policy."" These statements reassure us that the company really does care about the environment and social issues. Often the worst offenders have the best spin, admitting past discretions and, like a reformed criminal, promising to do better this time – be honest. Let's have a look at some greenwashing all-stars: What it says: In July 2000, BP launched a massive $200 million public relations and advertising campaign with the new slogan ""Beyond Petroleum."" It changed its logo to a green and yellow sun, and started spouting green-tinged comments. What it does: In March 2006, BP spilled 200,000 gallons of crude oil in Alaska. The spill happened because BP failed to perform routine maintenance on its pipeline. In October 2007, BP was ordered to pay more than $60 million by the U.S. Department of Justice for breaking environmental laws in Texas and Alaska. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, this was the largest fine ever handed out for breaking Clean Air regulations. In addition, BP has lobbied continuously to open up the Alaska National Wilderness Reserve for oil drilling and to block legislation to introduce a mandatory curb on greenhouse gases in the U.S. What it says: ""We are guided by our core values: Safety and Health; Environmental Stewardship; Respect for People; Ethical Behavior. DuPont has a 204-year legacy of core values, rooted strongly in safety, health and environmental stewardship. For almost 20 years, we have been reducing the environmental footprint of our own operations,"" (DuPont website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: DuPont is the largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The company continued producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) throughout the 1980s even though research in the ‘70s showed these chemicals contributed to ozone layer depletion. In January 2005, DuPont reported a study on the chemical PFOA (a chemical used in Teflon and other nonstick products), saying there were no known human health effects associated with exposure to PFOA. However, it was reported in the Charleston Gazette (""DuPont Distorted C8 Study, Scientists,"" October 2007) that DuPont distorted the findings and the study actually said there were several harmful health effects associated with this chemical, including low birth weight rates and elevated cholesterol. What it says: GE launched a $90 million ""Ecomagination"" marketing campaign in 2005. As part of the campaign, GE produced ads with a diesel train engine slipping through pristine mountains surrounded by flowers, birds and trees. What it does: In a piece of impressive hypocrisy, while it ran the ""enviro-choo choo"" ads, the company was simultaneously lobbying the EPA to weaken proposed nitrogen oxide restrictions for diesel engines. A reduction in smog from trains and ships could provide more than $70 billion in health and environmental benefits within 20 years, according to the EPA, meanwhile, the cost of compliance would be only $2-$3 billion. What it says: ""Recognizing the potential risks associated with climate change, we are taking actions to improve efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are also working with the scientific and business communities to undertake research to identify and develop economically competitive and affordable technologies to reduce long-term global greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the world's growing demand for energy"" (Exxon Mobil website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: The oil company funded 43 climate change denial groups in 2004 alone, according to a study by the U.S. Union of Concerned Scientists. Their report states that, between 1990 and 2005, the company funneled more than $16 million to advocacy groups that promote the denial of global warming through publications and websites that are not peer reviewed by the scientific community. (To read more about energy disputes, see The Biofuels Debate and Peak Oil: What To Do When The Wells Run Dry.) What it says: ""We apply innovation and technology to help farmers around the world be successful, produce healthier foods, better animal feeds and more fiber, while also reducing agriculture's impact on our environment"" (Monsanto website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: In June 2007, Monsanto acquired Delta & Pine Land Company, a company that creates ""terminator"" seeds. These seeds grow into plants that produce sterile seed. This means farmers can't replant seeds from a previous crop, making them dependent on the company year after year. In the 1930s Monsanto bought the company that invented PCBs, a now-banned industrial coolant, and became the source of nearly all PCBs in the U.S. In a January 2002 Washington Post article (""Monsato Hid Decades Of Pollution""), it was revealed that Monsanto hid 40 years worth of PCB pollution in Anniston, Alabama. It's alleged the company dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into open-pit landfills and routinely discharged toxic waste into a nearby creek. If you suspect that the latest green convert isn't as pious as it claims to be, your first stop should be the internet. The backlash against greenwashing is growing, and information is getting easier to find. The following nonprofit websites are dedicated to telling the other side of the story: These sites allow readers to cut through much of the spin a company produces. The information on these sites is referenced and sourced. Note: Much of the environmental record research for this article began at these sites. Not every company that touts its green achievements is lying, but it's important to remember that advertising and marketing campaigns are designed to highlight the good and ignore the bad. Sometimes it's cheaper to say you're a friend of the forest than to stop chopping down trees. A healthy dose of skepticism is the key. Green marketing should only be swallowed with a grain of salt. Remember, if the tree-hugger beard looks too good to be true, it probably is. ",The Green Marketing Machine

We are also working with the scientific and business communities to undertake research to identify and develop economically competitive and affordable technologies to reduce long-term global greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the world's growing demand for energy"" (Exxon Mobil website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: The oil company funded 43 climate change denial groups in 2004 alone, according to a study by the U.S. Union of Concerned Scientists. Their report states that, between 1990 and 2005, the company funneled more than $16 million to advocacy groups that promote the denial of global warming through publications and websites that are not peer reviewed by the scientific community. (To read more about energy disputes, see The Biofuels Debate and Peak Oil: What To Do When The Wells Run Dry.) What it says: ""We apply innovation and technology to help farmers around the world be successful, produce healthier foods, better animal feeds and more fiber, while also reducing agriculture's impact on our environment"" (Monsanto website, accessed November 4, 2007). What it does: In June 2007, Monsanto acquired Delta & Pine Land Company, a company that creates ""terminator"" seeds. These seeds grow into plants that produce sterile seed. This means farmers can't replant seeds from a previous crop, making them dependent on the company year after year. In the 1930s Monsanto bought the company that invented PCBs, a now-banned industrial coolant, and became the source of nearly all PCBs in the U.S. In a January 2002 Washington Post article (""Monsato Hid Decades Of Pollution""), it was revealed that Monsanto hid 40 years worth of PCB pollution in Anniston, Alabama. It's alleged the company dumped millions of pounds of PCBs into open-pit landfills and routinely discharged toxic waste into a nearby creek.

Tom DiChristopher,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"Exxon Mobil beat Wall Street's expectations as first quarter earnings more than doubled profits in the year ago period on rising oil prices and cost cutting. Shares were up 1.6 percent following the release. The world's most valuable publicly traded energy company posted profits of $4 billion, or 95 cents per share, for the quarter, compared with analysts' EPS estimates for 85 cents. The Irving, Texas-based oil giant earned $1.8 billion, or 43 cents a share in the year ago period. ""Our results reflect an increase in commodity prices and highlight our continued focus on controlling costs and operating efficiently,"" Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement. The integrated energy company brought in $63.3 billion in revenues, missing expectations for $64.7 billion. Exxon's cash flow generated by its operations — a key metric in the oil and gas industry —were $8.2 billion, significantly better than $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, costs fell as Exxon reduced its capital and exploration spending by $4.2 billion, down 19 percent over the past year. Earnings in Exxon's upstream exploration and production segment improved to $2.3 billion as the company fetched a higher price for its products. Downstream fuel refining and marketing operations earned $1.1 billion, a slight jump from the year-ago period. Higher profit margins among other factors underscored the improvement. Profits in Exxon's chemicals business fell by $184 million from last year to $1.2 billion, hurt by weaker profit margins and foreign exchange factors. Exxon announced significant investments in its U.S. drilling and refining operations in the first quarter. In January, it doubled its oil and gas holdings in the southern Permian Basin with a $5.6 billion purchase. Last month, it said it would invest $20 billion in its Gulf Coast chemical and oil refining facilities over the next five years. The quarter also saw Exxon reduce its overall oil reserves by 3.3 billion barrels, as persistently low oil prices forced the company to take off its books 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen reserves at its Alberta, Canada oil sands project. This came after Exxon took a $2 billion impairment in the previous quarter related to a downward revision of its U.S. reserves. On Wednesday, Exxon announced a 77 cents quarterly dividend, a two cents increase from last quarter. ",Exxon Mobil beats earnings expectations as profits double
Bob Pisani,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"My colleague Juan Aruego, who has been tracking earnings at CNBC for many years, this morning called my attention to a little-noticed item on Apple's earnings call: the company's share count fell 66.3 million shares during the quarter. At Tuesday's closing price, Juan told me, that is a $9.8 billion drop in market cap. It's a very important point. Apple is part of an elite group I call ""buyback monsters,"" companies that have been aggressively buying back stock for years. Apple's shares outstanding topped out in 2013 at roughly 6.6 billion shares. Since then it has been down every year and now stands at 5.2 billion. That is a reduction of 21 percent in shares outstanding since 2013. What's that mean? It means all other things being equal, the company's earnings per share are 21 percent higher than they would have been had it not done the buybacks. But that's only since 2013 ... there are companies that have been doing this much longer. IBM's shares outstanding topped out at 2.3 billion way back in 1995, it's been going down almost every year since then, and now stands at 939 million shares. Think about that. That's a 60 percent reduction in shares outstanding in a little more than 20 years. Same with Exxon Mobil. After the Mobil acquisition in 1999, shares outstanding topped out at just shy of 7 billion in 2000 and have been going almost steadily downhill since. There's now 4.2 billion shares outstanding, a reduction of 40 percent since 2000. Other big names have gotten more aggressive only recently. General Electric, for example, dramatically cut its shares outstanding from 10.0 billion shares to 8.7 billion in 2016, a 13 percent reduction. McDonald's has reduced its share count by 39 percent since 2000. Pfizer has lowered its share count by 25 percent since 2010. I could go on, but you get the point. Is there anything wrong with this? No, but it does lead to charges that companies are spending more money on ""financial engineering"" than on capital spending. It certainly does indicate that companies are at a loss on how to improve their top line, which is what will ultimately improve the bottom line. It leads to frequent complaints by analysts about the ""quality"" of earnings. One final point: while all this ""financial engineering"" helps boost earnings and stock prices, it also serves to reduce the weight in the various indexes, particularly the S&P 500. In an era where indexing rules, it means Exxon Mobil and IBM are not nearly as influential as they used to be. The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity.

Catherine Clifford,05042017,CNBC,04272017,"As the school year comes to a close, internship season is kicking off for many students. But not all interns make coffee runs for no pay. In particular, in finance and tech, college interns are paid very well with lots of perks. Facebook summer interns, for example, earn almost twice what the average American worker makes — $8,000 per month working at Mark Zuckerberg's social media behemoth, according to a new report from jobs website  Glassdoor. Annualized, that's $96,000. The average U.S. worker makes $51,350,  according to March 2017 data, also from Glassdoor. Here's a look at the 25 highest-paid internships in America and what it's like being a summer intern at these companies. Observations are pulled from anonymously submitted feedback on Glassdoor. 1.

"Tim Mullaney, special to CNBC.com",05042017,CNBC,04272017,"With Apple set to report second-quarter profits Tuesday, it's only a little bit of an exaggeration to say all of Wall Street's about to get a little bit of a raise. That's because the spring is when Apple typically announces its annual dividend hike. After a 24 percent jump in Apple shares this year, their yield is just about 1.6 percent, well below its peak and even below the yield of the Standard & Poor's 500 and its corresponding ETFs like IVV and SPY which yield roughly 1.9 percent. And that matters, even to people who don't directly own Apple shares, because the world's most-valuable company —that is sitting on a stockpile of cash that has topped $250 billion — is a core holding of both index mutual funds and the inexpensive exchange-traded funds held by more than 5 million U.S. households, according to the Investment Company Institute. ""This is normally the quarter when they talk about (dividends and stock buybacks) and we expect it to be the focus,'' said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. ""No one will really care about the iPhone results ahead of a massive launch of the iPhone 8 [in September]."" Everybody has a stake in Apple this year in particular, since the stock's recent run to as high as $145 from about $92 last June has been driving indexes and index funds. One measure of Apple's recent importance: It accounts for almost 30 percent of the gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since it hit 20,000.The next-most important stock in the 6 percent-plus rise for Dow ETFs this year — DIA and IYY — has been airplane giant Boeing. In the world of ETFs, Apple shares loom large. Apple is roughly 15 percent of the S&P 500 Technology Index ETF (XLK) and 17 percent of the $3.3 billion iShares U.S. Technology Fund (IYW). Apple is 3.66 percent of the S&P 500 ETF, according to Morningstar. The dividend announcement is likely to accompany an expansion of Apple's stock buybacks, perhaps by as much as $45 billion to $50 billion, according to an estimate done by Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski. Its not a shareholder reward program Apple tends to divulge details on until later in the year, but CFRA analyst Zino suggested that may change if details President Trump's plans to allow low-tax repatriation of offshore corporate cash holdings become clear — it was not presented with any detail in the tax reform overview provided by the White House last week. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company has allocated several billion dollars of its offshore holdings for buybacks as soon as the company can move the money into the U.S. without paying U.S. corporate taxes on it. Most market watchers, noting that as much as three-fourths of cash repatriated during a tax holiday on foreign profits while George W. Bush was president — even though it was technically prohibited by Congress — expect Apple to pay out much more. ""They could reduce the share count another 20 percent if they get the repatriation effect,"" Zino said. More from ETF Strategist:The death of active management in one article
Tesla's ETF problem
Playing Elon Musk's energy agenda through ETFs The company has been returning capital to holders of shares since 2012, when it instituted a buyback and dividend in response to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn. Apple's initial dividend was the largest ""dividend increase"" in the S&P 500 ever, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. About 94 percent of its $246 million in cash and securities is held overseas, as the company uses most domestic profits for reinvestment and return to shareholders, supplemented by money the company has borrowed for buybacks. Apple raised its quarterly dividend, currently 57 cents, by a nickel each of the past two years, while buybacks have reduced Apple's shares outstanding by almost 20 percent, worth about $150 billion at today's share price. The amount Apple spends on dividends, about $12 billion last fiscal year, has been nearly unchanged because the higher payout is offset by the shrinking number of shares, Zino said. The company's yield since 2012 has fluctuated between about its current level and about 2.4 percent, fluctuating with Apple's stock price. In February, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani suggested the company could afford to boost its payout to 4 percent, though Zino considers such a sharp move unlikely, and Apple has played it safe with dividend raises in recent history rather than meet more aggressive wishes from Wall Street and investors. Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com, said investors interested in Apple as a dividend play still have to come back to an obvious fact: ""The way to play Apple (or any other company) isn't with an ETF, it's with the stock,"" Nadig said. ""Of course, if you are trying to participate in the broad market you want some exposure to Apple. That's the beauty of a cap-weighted index. If you own a total market ETF your exposure to Apple is exactly as important as the entire stock market has decided it is."" Another modest boost wouldn't goose shares of Apple, or the funds that hold its stock, much higher in the near term. But a higher payout would buttress the foundation for longer-term returns for Apple's owners. Dividend stocks have always been safe havens in a volatile market, but they're tanking in 2018.

Reuben Gregg Brewer,05042017,Fool,04272017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Despite a lingering oil sector downturn, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remained an industry leader. For example, unlike many peers, it's been profitable throughout this difficult period and it's continued to increase its dividend annually  for 34 years and counting. While investors can take solace in the oil and gas giant's business performance, that doesn't mean the very real issues clouding the company's outlook can be ignored. Here are three challenges facing ExxonMobil Corporation today. Low oil prices have an impact throughout Exxon's business. On the one hand, cheap oil actually helps the company's refining and chemicals operations because it means a key feedstock is, well, cheap. That, in turn, helps these businesses widen margins and make more money. This highlights a key advantage of Exxon's integrated business model. But if prices go up, margins will get squeezed. Image source: ExxonMobil Corporation And then there's oil drilling, which is the largest part of the business. In the second quarter of 2014, before oil prices started a precipitous plunge from over $100 a barrel to a low around $30, Exxon's upstream segment had earnings of nearly $7.9 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2016, after prices had recovered from their lows to the $50 range, upstream earned roughly $1.4 billion. That figure is after taking out the impact of an asset impairment charge that pushed it nearly $650 million into the red. The benefit of low oil prices can offset only a portion of the pain when it's on that scale. In other words, oil will continue to drive results up and down, and there's little Exxon can do about that. That said, the company has used the downturn to invest in new assets that should help enhance its flexibility in a low-oil-price world (more on the pros and cons of that below). . Oil prices have a direct impact on the second big issue facing Exxon: maintaining reserves. From a big-picture point of view, oil companies have a set amount of oil and natural gas in the ground. Every barrel they pull up is one less barrel available for the future. Which is why oil companies are always on the lookout for new sources of oil. In 2016 Exxon replaced only about two-thirds of the oil it produced. That was the first time in more than two decades that it didn't replenish its reserves with at least the amount it drilled. Replacement numbers go up and down, so one year isn't enough to indicate a problem...yet. The issue is that low oil prices make it harder to find profitable oil to replace what's pulled up, let alone enough to actually grow reserves. When oil is over $100 a barrel, companies can drill almost anywhere profitably (that's hyperbole, but you get the idea). When oil is at $30 a barrel, it's awfully hard to justify spending much money on anything. That said, Exxon recently announced a large oil discovery in offshore Guyana. It's also expanded its footprint in the U.S. onshore space via an acquisition that roughly doubled its Permian basin holdings. Both should help support its reserves over time. And Exxon has plans to up its capital spending over the next few years, too. Still, keep an eye on reserves: If the situation doesn't improve Exxon will have a major long-term problem. The Permian acquisition is notable because it indicates a shift in the company's thinking. Historically, Exxon has focused on large and expensive projects that took years to complete. That's pretty much the specialty of big integrated oil companies. Although Exxon is hardly abandoning such projects, low oil prices make it harder to justify those investments. Exxon is shifting away from giant oil projects over the near term. Image source: ExxonMobil What the Permian purchase suggests is that the oil giant is looking to increase its flexibility by increasing its exposure to onshore U.S. drilling, which is easier to ramp up and down as oil prices change. That surely adds flexibility, but it's a different approach than Exxon has taken in the past and it could limit the company's ability to provide investors with industry leading investment returns. The U.S. onshore space simply doesn't offer the same returns as large projects. The increased focus on so-called ""short cycle"" projects (U.S. onshore) is coupled with continued investment in Exxon's downstream chemicals and refining businesses. The downstream business tends to have thinner margins than the upstream segment. In the end, more than half of Exxon's capital spending between now and 2020 is projected to support investments that don't provide the same return as big projects. That's potential headwind to Exxon living up to its past successes. On the plus side, all of this should help to diversify Exxon's business. And that should make returns more stable over time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are looking for a stable dividend paying business. Although Exxon just went through a leadership change, the company is pretty insular and changes relatively slowly. That's not a bad thing in this case, since Exxon has long been an industry leader. I believe strongly that it will survive this downturn and prosper again -- otherwise I wouldn't own it. However, my confidence doesn't alter the fact that the company has to deal with low oil prices and their impact on earnings. Or the impact that cheap oil has on finding profitable new oil resources. And then there's the company's increasing focus on businesses that don't offer the same bang for the buck as the giant oil projects for which Exxon is known. There are clearly risks here. That said, all of this bad news could be a good opportunity for long-term investors since the yield is toward the high end of its historical range. But you have to believe Exxon can survive the notable challenges it's facing today, and thrive in the future if you are going to pull the trigger here. ","
      
    3 Biggest Challenges Facing Dividend Giant ExxonMobil Corporation -- The Motley Fool

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is one of the America's oldest stock indexes, and it's easily the country's most iconic. It's comprised of 30 huge multinational corporations, all of which have demonstrated a penchant for creating shareholder value over the long run. Image source: Getty Images. For example, conglomerate General Electric is the sixth-largest company represented in the Dow, with a market cap of roughly $260 billion. But its share price is less than $30. Based on the current Dow divisor, which translates the share prices of Dow components into the point value that we follow as investors, GE's share price contributes just 202 of the Dow's 20,548 points, the closing value as of Friday, April 21. That's not even a full 1%. Yet, a company we'll be discussing in a moment that has just 30% of the market cap of GE also has seven times its influence in the Dow, all because of share price. In fact, through Friday, the Dow would be 308 points higher if the following three companies were merely flat for the year instead of down between 9% and 11%. Though it doesn't happen often, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) missed Wall Street's expectations by a wide margin in the first quarter, and that's the primary reason it's shaved nearly 155 points off the Dow year to date. It's also the aforementioned company that has seven times as much influence on the Dow as GE based solely on its share price. Image source: Getty Images. For the first quarter, Goldman wound up reporting $5.15 per share in EPS on $8.03 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Wall Street was looking for $420 million more in revenue and $0.16 more in earnings per share. Goldman attributed its subpar results to weakness in certain market segments. For instance, even though investment banking revenue scorched higher by 16% year over year, revenue from fixed income was flat, while equity revenue dipped 6% on account of weaker volumes in the United States. The low interest rate environment continues to hold back Goldman Sachs, which is listed as a bank in name, but is really an investment institution by practice. The good news is that at least the Federal Reserve is in the midst of tightening monetary policy, albeit slowly. As rates rise, investor demand for fixed-income assets will likely improve as well. This should reduce market volatility and give the king of bonds, Goldman Sachs, some healthy profits. But it's going to take time before the bond market is a boon once again for Goldman Sachs. In the interim, it's been quite the drag on the Dow in 2017. Integrated oil and gas companies have regularly taken it on the chin over the past three years. Surprisingly, though, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has held up better than many of its peers. Its geographic diversity and ability to cut costs probably played a key role in its ability to withstand sinking crude oil prices. Image source: Getty Images. However, in 2017 Chevron has been notably weaker. On a pure percentage basis, Chevron is the worst-performing stock in the Dow year to date, and it's removed almost 88 Dow points. The failure of crude prices to move higher is one reason Chevron is struggling. Despite cuts from OPEC that were expected to reduce supply and help buoy crude prices, U.S. crude and gasoline inventories hit an all-time record high in mid-February. This picture paints the need for more production cuts in the future, and more importantly, shows there is no quick fix for crude oil prices. The other issue for Chevron is that its fourth-quarter earnings results, released earlier this year, weren't very encouraging. Despite the company's $415 million in net income during Q4 2016, there were a handful of disappointments. For instance, Chevron's operating cash flow is still not high enough to cover the costs of paying out its dividend. Chevron has admittedly worked hard to become a Dividend Aristocrat (i.e., a company that's increased its payout for 25 or more consecutive years) and likely doesn't want to give up that title, but it's being forced to issue debt to cover a portion of its payouts at the moment. Additionally, the company's U.S. downstream operations produced no earnings as a result of a 21% decline in per-day output, which Chevron blamed on planned turnaround activity at its refinery in Richmond, California. The good news for investors is that Chevron still has plenty of cost-cutting channels left, as well as numerous projects that are poised to boost production over the long term. However, an ongoing crude supply glut is a problem that isn't likely to be resolved anytime soon. Finally, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is in much the same boat as Chevron. Its stock has held up far better than many of its peers, but rising U.S. crude and gasoline inventories clearly have investors concerned. This year hasn't been so kind to big oil stocks, with ExxonMobil removing more than 65 points from the Dow in 2017. Image source: Pixabay. Though ExxonMobil's fourth-quarter report was a bit more upbeat than Chevron's -- after all, it was able to cover its dividend payouts with cash flow generated from operations and asset sales -- it still came with some clear downsides. For instance, ExxonMobil wound up taking an impairment charge of about $2 billion in its U.S. upstream segment that was tied to undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains. The company also saw its full-year 2016 earnings hit by weaker refining margins, although this was a sectorwide issue last year. And, for those shareholders who've become accustomed to ExxonMobil being exceptionally generous with share buybacks, there's been a notable decline in the number of shares it's repurchasing. Like Chevron, ExxonMobil has the ability to reduce its expenditures to account for weakened demand or modestly lower commodity prices. Its Q4 2016 capital expenditures were down 35% from the prior-year quarter, to $4.8 billion. These are the types of steep cuts that may be needed if ExxonMobil wants to keep its healthy dividend firmly in place. ExxonMobil has ample projects underway to boost production in the years to come, but without oil industry dynamics favoring the company, it could be tough sledding in 2017. ","

Nigerian labor unions have criticized oil companies for sacking workers in the last few months and held a number of strikes. Abel Agarin, who chairs the Lagos zone of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), said members of his union were on strike in protest at the sacking of 150 workers in December. He said 82 were PENGASSAN members. “We want them to be brought back and if that is not possible we want a proper severance package for them,” said Agarin, who led around 50 protesters in the commercial capital. PENGASSAN said strikes were being held in Lagos, Bonny, Akwa Ibom and Port Harcourt. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said by email that there were “no impacts” on oil production. Two oil traders said it was too early to say whether the strikes would have an impact on production. Strikes by Exxon workers in Nigeria at the end of 2016 did impact output, leading to weeks-long loading delays. ","

Bob Pisani,05112017,CNBC,05042017,"Is the stock market priced for perfection? It sure is, but with these data points it makes sense for stocks to be pricey: This is a rare confluence of events — lower risk right across the board. It's not surprising that world markets are at new highs: Global stock marketsU.S.: historic highGermany: historic highFrance: multiyear highJapan: 16-month highEmerging markets (EEM): 23-month high Is the U.S. market expensive? Sure, by historic standards. Stocks have a very good correlation with forward earnings estimates. According to FactSet, the forward P/E estimate for the S&P 500 — which includes the last eight months of this year and the first four months of 2018 — is 17.5 (2,396/$137.04 = 17.5). The 20-year average is 16.0, so the current estimate is above average, but not dramatically so. It's also not surprising that with these kinds of data points we are getting markets at new highs, but traders are whining about the low volume and low volatility. Again, this is not shocking: prices are too high to make buyers enthusiastic, but sellers are not enthusiastic either because everyone believes that a modest drop in the market will only be met with more buying. Finally, for everyone who keeps asking me why I am spending so much time on European earnings and the economic state of Europe, it's pretty simple: many people own Europe through ETFs now, and U.S.-based companies get a significant portion of their revenues from Europe. By ""significant,"" I mean roughly 15 percent or above: The lesson here: Europe matters for U.S. investors! The fact that all the FANG names were down 2 percent to 3 percent, and the industrial and energy sectors were down 1.5 percent each, points to a bigger problem. It's true that gridlock often has been good for stocks, but it's not clear it will be this time around. Stock and bond ETFs associated with active trading saw heavy volumes and some withdrawals during October's turbulent market conditions, while investors put money into exchange traded funds that are more associated with buy and hold strategies. Companies are coming out of ""blackout periods"" around their earnings and can now increase their buyback activity. A CNBC reporter since 1990, Bob Pisani covers Wall Street from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Tariff concerns remain a key talking point on Wall Street when dissecting the market volatility fit over the past month, but the issue seems to be carrying less heft among corporate executives. Aurora Cannabis reported on Monday that revenue jumped 260 percent over the last 12 months, with kilograms produced climbing to 4,996 from 1,010 over the past year.

Reuben Gregg Brewer,05112017,Fool,05042017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Despite a lingering oil sector downturn, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has remained an industry leader. For example, unlike many peers, it's been profitable throughout this difficult period and it's continued to increase its dividend annually  for 34 years and counting. While investors can take solace in the oil and gas giant's business performance, that doesn't mean the very real issues clouding the company's outlook can be ignored. Here are three challenges facing ExxonMobil Corporation today. Low oil prices have an impact throughout Exxon's business. On the one hand, cheap oil actually helps the company's refining and chemicals operations because it means a key feedstock is, well, cheap. That, in turn, helps these businesses widen margins and make more money. This highlights a key advantage of Exxon's integrated business model. But if prices go up, margins will get squeezed. Image source: ExxonMobil Corporation And then there's oil drilling, which is the largest part of the business. In the second quarter of 2014, before oil prices started a precipitous plunge from over $100 a barrel to a low around $30, Exxon's upstream segment had earnings of nearly $7.9 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2016, after prices had recovered from their lows to the $50 range, upstream earned roughly $1.4 billion. That figure is after taking out the impact of an asset impairment charge that pushed it nearly $650 million into the red. The benefit of low oil prices can offset only a portion of the pain when it's on that scale. In other words, oil will continue to drive results up and down, and there's little Exxon can do about that. That said, the company has used the downturn to invest in new assets that should help enhance its flexibility in a low-oil-price world (more on the pros and cons of that below). . Oil prices have a direct impact on the second big issue facing Exxon: maintaining reserves. From a big-picture point of view, oil companies have a set amount of oil and natural gas in the ground. Every barrel they pull up is one less barrel available for the future. Which is why oil companies are always on the lookout for new sources of oil. In 2016 Exxon replaced only about two-thirds of the oil it produced. That was the first time in more than two decades that it didn't replenish its reserves with at least the amount it drilled. Replacement numbers go up and down, so one year isn't enough to indicate a problem...yet. The issue is that low oil prices make it harder to find profitable oil to replace what's pulled up, let alone enough to actually grow reserves. When oil is over $100 a barrel, companies can drill almost anywhere profitably (that's hyperbole, but you get the idea). When oil is at $30 a barrel, it's awfully hard to justify spending much money on anything. That said, Exxon recently announced a large oil discovery in offshore Guyana. It's also expanded its footprint in the U.S. onshore space via an acquisition that roughly doubled its Permian basin holdings. Both should help support its reserves over time. And Exxon has plans to up its capital spending over the next few years, too. Still, keep an eye on reserves: If the situation doesn't improve Exxon will have a major long-term problem. The Permian acquisition is notable because it indicates a shift in the company's thinking. Historically, Exxon has focused on large and expensive projects that took years to complete. That's pretty much the specialty of big integrated oil companies. Although Exxon is hardly abandoning such projects, low oil prices make it harder to justify those investments. Exxon is shifting away from giant oil projects over the near term. Image source: ExxonMobil What the Permian purchase suggests is that the oil giant is looking to increase its flexibility by increasing its exposure to onshore U.S. drilling, which is easier to ramp up and down as oil prices change. That surely adds flexibility, but it's a different approach than Exxon has taken in the past and it could limit the company's ability to provide investors with industry leading investment returns. The U.S. onshore space simply doesn't offer the same returns as large projects. The increased focus on so-called ""short cycle"" projects (U.S. onshore) is coupled with continued investment in Exxon's downstream chemicals and refining businesses. The downstream business tends to have thinner margins than the upstream segment. In the end, more than half of Exxon's capital spending between now and 2020 is projected to support investments that don't provide the same return as big projects. That's potential headwind to Exxon living up to its past successes. On the plus side, all of this should help to diversify Exxon's business. And that should make returns more stable over time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are looking for a stable dividend paying business. Although Exxon just went through a leadership change, the company is pretty insular and changes relatively slowly. That's not a bad thing in this case, since Exxon has long been an industry leader. I believe strongly that it will survive this downturn and prosper again -- otherwise I wouldn't own it. However, my confidence doesn't alter the fact that the company has to deal with low oil prices and their impact on earnings. Or the impact that cheap oil has on finding profitable new oil resources.

,05182017,Reuters,05112017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp announced it will bring its Mobil-brand gas stations to Mexico, pumping $300 million in the coming decade as it seeks to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. Exxon expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will offer motorists its Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels, the U.S.-based oil company said in a statement on Wednesday. The company did not specify how many service stations it would open in Mexico or where it would source the fuel for them. But local newspaper Reforma reported on Wednesday that Exxon company official Martin Proske said in an interview that supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from state-owned Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. BP told Reuters on Wednesday that its foray into Mexico is proving more promising than expected, and that it would likely increase its investment in everything from exploration to retail fuel sales. Separately, Mexican media reported Royal Dutch Shell said it would also open its first gas station in the country this year, citing the firm’s downstream chief for Mexico, Andres Cavallari. Shell did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Latin America’s No. 2 economy is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed - by law - to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. “Recent energy reforms present a unique opportunity to help meet the growing demand for reliable fuel supplies and quality service in Mexico,” Exxon’s Proske said in a company statement. Fears had grown in Mexico that foreign investment might fall after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected last year, as he railed against companies that moved operations to Mexico. U.S.-Mexico relations have also been strained by Trump’s threat to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement and his promise to build a wall between the two countries. But Exxon’s announcement was the latest good news for Mexico’s economy after General Electric Co last week praised the country as vital to its growth and Siemens later said that it was going to swap out U.S. imports for local supplies at its Mexican plants. However, growing fuel theft has worried some in the energy sector. Mexican authorities have been struggling to contain criminal gangs siphoning off fuel that Pemex has said is costing it some 27,000 barrels per day in gasoline and diesel. ","

The Chinese partner of Kushner Companies, an immigration agency named Qiaowai, said on Friday that the meetings this month would go forward, but that no one from Kushner Companies would attend. Qiaowai had marketed the Kushner family's visit as a five-city tour over two weeks, ending in Wuhan. The Chinese firm will still give presentations on the New Jersey project, field questions on the investor visa program and solicit investments. Ms. Meyer added a star turn to efforts by Kushner Companies to raise money in China. Mr. Kushner is married to Mr. Trump's elder daughter, Ivanka. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, fascination with his family has grown in China, especially as Mr. Kushner has become a power broker in relations between Washington and Beijing. Speaking at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing on Saturday, Ms. Meyer said the New Jersey project, called One Journal Square, ""means a lot to me and my entire family."" She said Mr. Kushner, who resigned as chief executive of the company in January, was now serving in the White House. Ms. Meyer's remarks drew intense backlash in the United States, with critics seizing on the roadshow as a stark example of  the conflicts of interest in Mr. Trump's White House. The company later apologized, saying Ms. Meyer did not intend to use her brother's name to lure investors. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Kushner was in compliance with ethics rules and had ""nothing to do"" with the company's work in China. Adding to the fallout, the mayor of Jersey City, N.J., where One Journal Square is set to be built, said on Sunday that  he opposed the Kushner family's request for hefty tax breaks for the project. The roadshow also raised questions about the investor visa program known as EB-5, which has been plagued by fraud and abuse scandals and is likely to be overhauled this year. Even in China, where business and politics often mix, there was a hint of indignation. State-run news media published reports asking whether the company was benefiting from unfair competition. ""Caution urged on Kushner project,"" read a headline in the Global Times newspaper. But Hao Junbo, a lawyer in Beijing, said Ms. Meyer's emphasis on family connections would probably prove to be a winning message in China. ""Chinese people have a tradition of worshiping powerful officials,"" he said. ""It's an innate attraction to Chinese investors. They will automatically label the program as one with official backing after they hear the name of Trump's son-in-law.""

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

,05252017,Reuters,05182017,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Thursday that it will start importing its own gasoline into Mexico before the end of the year to supply the Mobil-brand gas stations it will be opening in Latin America’s second largest economy. ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry. Forecasts for peak oil demand diverge by decades. The Paris-based International Energy Agency argues that demand will grow, albeit slowly, past 2040. And the two biggest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand. Also see: The more family members the merrier, many luxury buyers say Those factors are making it much harder to predict long-term demand than in the past, according to many energy-industry executives and economists. Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.

ExxonMobil expects to open its first service stations in Mexico later this year and will sell gasoline and diesel fuels, as it pumps $300 million in the coming decade in an effort to gain a foothold in the country’s retail fuel market. “The start of this will be before year end, either through open season or through commitments with infrastructure developers,” said Martin Proske, the company’s director of fuels in Mexico, of when ExxonMobil would start importing its own gasoline to supply the service stations. The so-called open season auctions, which will be staggered throughout this year, will allow private companies to bid for access to surplus pipeline capacity within state-owned Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] existing network. For decades, Mexico’s fuel market was closed, by law, to any company but Pemex. But in 2013, reforms ended Pemex’s monopoly in everything from crude oil production to retail sales. Proske said future supply options included importing fuel via train or boat or buying gasoline from Pemex. The plan follows BP Plc’s announcement earlier this year that the British oil giant would open about 1,500 service stations in Mexico within five years. Mexico is home to about 11,400 gas stations and is the world’s fourth biggest gasoline market, Mexico’s energy minister has said. ","

Mark Kolakowski,05252017,Investopedia,05182017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs With nearly all companies in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) reporting first quarter profits, aggregate earnings for companies in the index are trending towards a 13.6% gain versus the same period in 2016, according to data from FactSet cited by the Wall Street Journal. This would be the biggest year-over-year profit increase since the third quarter of 2011, the Journal adds, and is a driving factor in the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 7.6% through Thursday's open. Among the encouraging signs for investors are two things. The first is the large number of companies announcing high-quality earnings: these are profits fueled by strong fundamental revenue and unit sales growth as opposed to short-term earnings oilers such as stock buybacks and accelerating or delaying key writeoffs or charges to make a specific quarter look good - or less bad. The second positive sign is the broad-based nature of the profit surge. While financial and technology companies are among those showing the greatest earnings improvements, 10 of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors nonetheless are poised to show gains, per the same FactSet data cited by the Journal. Moreover, an upward trend in profits is underway. S&P 500 profits now have improved in three consecutive quarters, and analysts are projecting another 6.8% year-over-year earnings increase for the second quarter, while forecasting that the full year will clock in with an 11% improvement versus 2016, also according to FactSet and the Journal. As evidence of how diversified the profit gains are by industry, among the companies mentioned by the Journal for noteworthy performance are social networking leader Facebook Inc. (FB), multinational petroleum exploration, refining and marketing colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), heavy construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and financial giant Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the corporate parent of Merrill Lynch. The year-to-date changes in these companies' stock prices through Thursday's open are, respectively, +30.7%, -7.1%, +14.6% and +6.3%. Facebook recorded $3.06 billion in first quarter profits, up a breathtaking 76% from the same period in 2016, the Journal says. The company's user base is growing, and advertising dollars are flooding in as a result. (For more, see also: Why Mega Tech Stocks Will Win Longterm.) Caterpillar's first quarter revenues and earnings ""smashed Wall Street's expectations,"" according to CNBC. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.28, 106% above the consensus estimate of $0.62, and revenue was $9.822 billion, 5.9% better than the estimate of $9.271 billion, per Thomson Reuters data cited by CNBC. The company finally saw an uptick in demand as an economic recovery progresses around the globe, while also benefiting from cost cutting, Forbes reports.  Bank of America enjoyed a 40% profit boost year-over-year. Key factors were increases in securities trading revenues and net interest income, the result of rising interest rates, as the Journal explains in another article. Exxon Mobil reported its best quarterly results since 2015, and more than doubled its profits versus the first quarter of 2016, when crude oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a decade, as another Journal story details. However, though crude oil prices are up versus a year ago, they have slipped so far this year, pulling the shares of Exxon Mobil and other energy companies downward. Meanwhile, energy is among those sectors that posted impressive earnings gains year-over-year precisely because the year-ago period was so bad, the Journal cautions. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude bottomed out at $29.42 per barrel on January 15, 2016, recovered to $53.72 by December 30, 2016, but opened Thursday at $51.25, down 4.6% for the year-to-date, per Bloomberg Markets data.

 ,05252017,CNBC,05182017,"A New York state appeals court on Tuesday ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp should be compelled to turn over records in an investigation into how much the company knew about global warming as it continued to publicly downplay the effects it was expected to have on the fossil fuel industry. Exxon has been battling subpoenas from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is probing the company for fraud in its public statements about climate change. The appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, rejecting Exxon's argument that the court did not properly consider which state's laws on turning over evidence in an investigation should apply in the case. The investigation is taking place in New York, but Exxon's headquarters are in Texas. ""We respect, but disagree with the court's decision and are assessing our options and potential next steps,"" said Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman. ""The unanimous appeals court rightly affirmed the lower court's decision and rejected Exxon's frivolous claims, which were merely one of the many tactics the company has employed in its campaign of delay and distraction,"" said Schneiderman's spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick. Exxon is also fighting the investigation in Manhattan federal court, arguing Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is conducting a separate probe, are motivated by politics. On Friday, Schneiderman asked a judge to dismiss Exxon's case. The investigation has already led to one public revelation: that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of Exxon, used a separate email address and an alias, ""Wayne Tracker,"" to discuss climate change-related issues while at the company. In his filing in federal court on Friday, Schneiderman revealed his office had interviewed witnesses who could help them learn more about the kind of records Exxon might have showing internal discussions about climate change. He described the move as an attempt to keep Exxon from destroying relevant records before they were required to be turned over in the investigation. The cases are People of the State of New York v PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil Corporation, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451962/2016, and 1:17-cv-2301 in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.

Brian Richards,05252017,Fool,05182017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It's a quick and fascinating read, both a point-in-time snapshot of a market at peak madness, and a timeless overview of Japanese business and investor attitudes and sensibilities. Image Source: Getty Images. Even though it was published near the Nikkei's apogee -- a level it hasn't sniffed in the 25-plus years since -- the book is guarded and balanced on those lofty levels (qualities not present in another peak-bubble book I've reviewed). As you can see below, 1989 was right about the top of the roller coaster: What follows are some of the fascinating things I learned, a few of which are quite relevant today. In early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, followed by the U.S. at 33% and the U.K. at 9%. In 2017, the U.S. represents 53% of global stock market capitalization. Japan, in   second place, has fallen all the way down to 8.4%. The U.K. remains in third, at 6.2%. Today, the 10 largest public companies in the world by market cap are all American. Apple, by market cap, is nine times larger than NTT (market value: about $90 billion according to data from S&P Market Intelligence). That's a pretty incredible shift in global fortunes, all in a span of just the past 30 years. It reminds me of the adage that ""all investing is active investing."" Imagine for a second that index investing had been popular back then, and ""total world stock index"" investors had sat back and let their bets ride along with the market over the ensuing years -- a world market dominated by Japan. This book has reminded me that past returns are no guarantee of future results, and that a ""passive"" approach of buying the S&P 500 is actually quite an active investment choice. Consider: In 1987, four of the top 10 companies granted U.S. patents were Japanese (including numbers 1-3). Interestingly, in 2015, the latest year for which data is available, that situation hasn't changed much: Canon, Toshiba, and Sony were among the top 10 recipients of patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. In early 1989, the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for all stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section was around 58. Today, on an index-weight basis, the Nikkei 225 is trading for about 18 times earnings. It was quite common for company A to buy company B's shares, and vice-versa. It was a way of strengthening ties with between companies and their suppliers, banks, customers, vendors, you name it. Back then, Roth wrote, ""Toyota Motor lists on its books holdings of 853 million shares in nearly 300 companies (not including subsidiaries). Such shares seldom trade."" Deutsche Bank has sold its remaining stake in Daimler AG in one of the final steps toward unwinding 'Germany Inc,' a once powerful system of cross-shareholdings in Europe's largest economy. ... Just 13 years ago, 60 of Germany's 100 biggest companies belonged to the shareholding network, set up as a tool to protect German companies from foreign takeover and provide support in the event of large-scale bankruptcies. Consider, via Roth's book: Score one for skeptical publications. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is 'probably the most cynical, speculative, and manipulative major stock market in the world. Its traders are interested in the quantity, not the quality, of buying interest. The key factors in any day's trading are herd instinct, ramping, and brokers' 'stories' about what to buy for which usually spurious reason. Roth is unkind to the Pollyannaish local media: The stock press views itself as an integral part of the market, to which it displays a relentlessly optimistic posture. When stocks are moving up it is their biggest cheerleader; when they start falling the papers wonder out loud when it will be time to buy again. Look again at the post-World War 2 to 1989 rise! In just the 1980s, Roth writes, ""$10,000 invested in Japanese stocks in 1982 would by early 1989 have grown to around $100,000, thanks to the simultaneous skyrocketing of the Japanese stock market and the yen."" In today's low-yield environment, this may sound eerily similar: ""An investor in many Western countries can garner a good return from secure government bonds or even a long-term bank deposit. But in Japan the stock market is one of the few places where investors can hope to receive a return on their investment of more than a few percent a year."" The way people in the late 1980s talked about Nomura sounds a lot like how people talk about Goldman Sachs today... Here's Matt Taibbi's famous Rolling Stone lede from ""The Great American Bubble Machine"": The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. Roth doesn't have Taibbi's prose skills, but he paints a similar picture of Nomura circa 1989: For some observers ... the name is unloved. Others take a more extreme view, believing the company exercises some demon-like control over the entire Japanese financial establishment. Though like Goldman today, Nomura was simultaneously hated and revered: ""But many admire -- and openly stand in awe of -- the way in which the company has so successfully ... transformed itself into a financial powerhouse capable of taking on the world."" Fun fact: In the late 1980s, more Oxford and Cambridge graduates worked for Nomura than for any institution other than the U.K. government. This table outlining the differences in living standards is eye-opening: We know how the story of the Tokyo bull market ended. But reading a book that was published when Japan's stock market was at its zenith has been a valuable reminder of the stories we were telling ourselves (or actively avoiding) back then, and the emotions that fueled that epic run-up. Credit to Martin Roth for writing a book that's far less dated than I expected when I ordered it from a used bookstore. ","

Elena Cherney,05252017,MarketWatch,05182017,"Published: June 5, 2017 12:27 p.m. ET Many oil companies are predicting peak oil demand By The world’s largest oil companies are girding for the biggest shift in energy consumption since the Industrial Revolution: After decades of growth, global demand for oil is poised to peak and fall in the coming years. New technologies that improve fuel efficiency are starting to push down the amount of gasoline and diesel that’s needed for transportation, and a consensus is growing that fuel demand for passenger cars could fall as carbon rules go into effect, electric vehicles gain traction and the internal combustion engine gets re-engineered to be dramatically more efficient. Western countries’ growth used to move in lockstep with their energy consumption, but that phenomenon is starting to decouple in advanced economies. While most big oil companies foresee a day when the world will need less crude, timing when that peak in oil demand will materialize is one of the hottest flashpoints for controversy within the industry. It’s tough to predict because changes to oil demand will hinge on future disruptive technologies, such as batteries in electric cars that will allow drivers to travel for hundreds of miles on a single charge. Hitting such a plateau would mark the first time that demand has declined even when economies are growing since Col. Edwin Drake jury-rigged a pipe to drill for oil in Pennsylvania in the late 1850s. Yet, for many companies and investors, the question isn’t whether this immense turning point will happen—it’s when. Getting that timing right will separate the winners from the losers, and it has become a major preoccupation for energy economists and a flashpoint for controversy within the industry.

The company’s base case calls for a peak in the mid-2040s—with the caveat that it could come sooner or later. “There are huge bands of uncertainty around that,” Dale says. The uncertainty stems from a host of variables, including the pace of technological changes that will make renewables and electric vehicles more cost-competitive; the toughness of new regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change; and the rate of economic growth in developing countries, which is currently driving the increase in oil demand.

Calling it accurately is high stakes for an industry sitting on trillions of dollars of crude-oil reserves. Whenever it finally does happen, the tipping point from global oil-demand growth to decline will reverberate through the energy world, knocking down oil prices and some companies’ shareholders. The idea that electric vehicles and alternative forms of energy will increasingly displace crude oil is one that big-name investors are starting to ask about. “We have lots of clients in the financial sector asking about peak demand,” says Linda Giesecke, research director at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm. “It’s because you have this threat of disruptive technology” such as electric vehicles, she says. “If it is disruptive, it will come fast. That’s why it’s so hard to forecast.” Case in point: Shareholders of Occidental Petroleum Corp.

                                   the world’s largest asset manager, supported the resolution, marking the first time it went against management wishes to support such a climate resolution Historically, producing crude oil has been a growth industry, if a cyclical one, with energy demand moving in step with economic output. Since 1965, global oil consumption has increased from 30 million barrels a day to nearly 95 million. During those decades, companies built strategic plans around the assumption that they would always need to find more oil, and analysts obsessed over whether there would be enough crude in the ground to fuel growth. When oil hit its high over $147 a barrel in the summer of 2008, some of the run-up was fueled by concern about hitting maximum output, or so-called peak oil, the point at which normal declines in output from producing oil fields outpace the industry’s ability to develop new supply. Now, peak-oil theory has been turned on its head, and forecasting peak demand has taken center stage. Some companies, particularly European energy outfits, see the tipping point coming soon enough that they are talking about it publicly, and overhauling their long-term investment plans to accommodate a greater emphasis on natural gas and renewables. Shell and Statoil say peak oil demand could come as soon as the mid-2020s, though around 2030 is more likely; the chief executive officer of France’s Total SA says he wouldn’t be surprised if it happens by 2040. But the American companies are betting on a more bullish future. Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, sees no end to the world’s need for more crude. In its forecast through 2040, Exxon predicts that oil will remain the dominant fuel source, as demand for both plastics and transportation grows, mostly because of increasing incomes across Asia. It does expect to see huge strides made in fuel efficiency, with the vehicle fleet improving to 50 miles a gallon from the current 30 MPG, but thinks the growth in other areas will have a bigger influence on oil use. Also read: Here’s some bad news for oil in 2018 Chevron’s outlook is similar: It expects roughly half the world’s energy needs will be met by oil and natural gas combined by 2040. Saudi Arabia’s national oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., says demand is unlikely to peak before 2050. “The peak-demand discussion is only at most a couple of years old,” says energy scholar Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of energy research at IHS Markit Ltd. But as peak demand has started to gain acceptance, “there has been a backlash against the idea,” especially by American companies. For the industry and many analysts, the concept of peak demand turns all their long-held assumptions about the energy world on their ear, Yergin says. Until recently, many were betting on strong demand growth from emerging markets as more people joined the middle class, he says. “There was just this assumption that all those people were going to keep buying cars and driving more miles.” Peak oil demand was one of the most hotly debated topics at the recent CERAWeek energy conference sponsored by IHS Markit in Houston. The CEOs of Shell and Statoil shared their predictions of a peak within 15 years. Weeks later, at an event at Columbia University, the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Amin Nasser, disputed that view. “Our belief is peak demand isn’t in sight,” he told the audience. To predict how demand is likely to grow — or, eventually, shrink — companies are paying close attention to what most view as the momentum around the world behind regulations to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and combat rising temperatures. Those measures include the adoption of higher prices on carbon in more-developed and developing countries. Experts see changes coming even in the U.S., where the Trump administration has already rolled back many Obama-era climate initiatives and hasn’t come out in support of the global climate-change accord struck in Paris in 2015. Efficiency gains and technological advances are seen as likely to further limit growth in cars’ demand for gasoline. Inside energy companies, strategists are building scenarios to consider questions that they can’t yet answer: Will cars drive themselves? Will governments tax carbon emissions at high enough rates to discourage fossil-fuel use? What kind of transit will a middle-class resident of Mumbai favor in the year 2035? And what kind of battery-technology breakthroughs could affect that choice between now and then? Outside of efficiency gains, which even peak-demand naysayers acknowledge are coming, the biggest “X” factor is how widespread electric-vehicle adoption will be. Transport fuel accounts for about 50% of the demand for crude oil, with cars accounting for half of that; that means 25% of total oil demand hinges on autos. For decades, Americans’ love of the open road, which made the country the largest oil user in the world, helped to drive global oil demand. But U.S. cars have gotten more efficient, due in part to government policies that mandate better mileage for every gallon of gasoline and diesel burned. That has slowed demand growth, and played into the oil-price rout of the past couple of years. Electric vehicles, self-driving cars and ride-sharing stand to further erode gasoline demand. The question is, how fast? That depends on batteries, many say. Battery technology is still too rudimentary, and too expensive, for electric vehicles to take hold en masse. If engineers can’t crack the lighter, cheaper, denser battery challenge, then the peak-demand scenario slows. But if a breakthrough in battery technology puts electric vehicles suddenly on a par with the cost of internal-combustion vehicles, or if carbon taxes in more countries are high enough to weigh on drivers, adoption rates could rise more quickly. That could shave millions more barrels a day off global oil demand. Varying predictions for electric-vehicle adoption drive a lot of the differences in forecasts. The IEA’s main scenario shows oil demand from cars in 2040 remaining close to the 24 million barrels a day that is now consumed. That estimate, says executive director Fatih Birol, is a big reason for the agency’s prediction that crude-oil demand is likely to keep growing at least past 2040. Birol says that even if EVs gain more traction—and he’s doubtful they will until batteries can last for several hundred miles—there’s still a lot of transportation with no electric alternative. Half of oil demand for transportation is driven not by passenger cars, but by jets and heavy-duty trucks. “Asian trucks alone, today, are responsible for one-third of global demand growth,” Birol says. “There’s barely any substitute. So even though the automotive sector may go through a transformation, we will still see oil demand grow.” Birol also says that as oil-demand growth from transportation wanes, the demand for oil in the petrochemical sector—to be used as a feedstock to generate more plastic items, from diapers to lightweight, fuel-efficient car parts—is still expected to increase. BP, meanwhile, expects the number of electric cars to skyrocket to 100 million by 2035 from one million today—but thinks even that rise will likely shave only one million to 1.5 million barrels a day off oil demand. “EVs aren’t a game changer,” says Dale, the BP group chief economist. (The company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, also says the company is gearing its investments toward a lower-carbon future, in part by shifting toward natural gas.) Wood Mackenzie expects roughly 2% of global oil demand—or two million barrels a day—to be lost to electric vehicles by 2035. Wood Mackenzie doesn’t expect oil demand to peak by 2035, but the firm does expect the world’s fuel mix to significantly change by 2050, with greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. But others see electric vehicles making significant inroads into oil demand. Statoil Chief Economist Eirik Wærness says expectations of higher electric-vehicle adoption are the main reason that his company’s peak-demand forecast of 2030 is earlier than BP’s. Statoil has shifted its long-term investment portfolio to reflect its forecast of demand peaking around 2030. The company plans to increase investment in renewables to between 15% and 20% of total investments, CEO Eldar Sætre said recently. Another crucial variable to consider is the developing world. Any leveling of driver demand for gasoline in rich countries could be offset by growing demand among new middle-class drivers in developing nations. Part of BP’s forecast of a mid-2040s peak rides on continued growth in developing nations. As China, India and other nations get wealthier over the next two decades, another two billion people—about a quarter of the world’s population—will move from low to middle incomes. “When that happens, your demand for oil increases,” says BP’s Dale. “You stop riding on overcrowded buses and trains, and you buy your first motorbike. And then you buy a car.” To come up with Statoil’s 2030 peak-demand forecast, Wærness, the company’s chief economist, says he thinks a lot about what life will be like 20 years from now for much of the world’s population—especially in India, which will emerge to lead global energy-demand growth in the 2020s, taking the mantle from China. “I’m not talking about people in New York and San Francisco but kids of the current poor people in Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai,” Wærness says. “They will become global middle-class consumers by 2040.” Consider this jet-fuel math: Seven times as many Chinese are flying now as in 2000, and six times as many Indians, he says. “When they get rich, they’ll want to travel to exciting places.” Why, then, does Statoil expect an early peak? The company sees increased demand balanced out by efforts in some developing countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and limit climate change. In China, for instance, the government is subsidizing electric vehicles, and in cities, only EVs are allowed on the road on days when air quality is bad. Such policies around the world stand to have a major impact on the fuel mix. Globally, carbon intensity and energy intensity have already peaked and will trend down through 2035, according to a Wood Mackenzie analysis. But many analysts say the Paris Agreement to limit global warming is just the beginning. And some companies are starting to plan accordingly. “To us, it’s real,” says Statoil’s Sætre. “The future has to be low carbon.” Lynn Cook is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal’s energy bureau, and Elena Cherney is global editor of the bureau.
