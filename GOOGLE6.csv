,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"Alexander Zharov, head of media regulator Roskomnadzor, said his agency sent a letter to Google on Tuesday requesting clarification on comments Saturday by Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt about how the Russian websites would be treated in search, according to Interfax. “We will receive an answer and understand what to do next,” Interfax quoted Zharov as saying. “We hope our opinion will be heard, and we won’t have to resort to more serious” retaliatory measures. Schmidt, speaking on stage at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday, responded to a question about Sputnik articles appearing on Google by saying the company was working to give less prominence to “those kinds of websites” as opposed to delisting them. The Russian government funds Sputnik and Russia Today, or RT. Both of the websites spread misinformation and published stories that were negative toward Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, U.S. intelligence agencies have said. “It’s basically RT and Sputnik that are the two, and there’s a whole bunch of coverage about what we’re doing there,” Schmidt said, according to a video of the talk posted on the event’s Facebook page. Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville said Schmidt was referring to ongoing efforts announced in April to demote search results that link to low quality, false and deliberately misleading content. The company said at the time it would work to highlight authoritative content. Google does not manually assign rankings to individual websites, Faville said, but analyzes a website’s attributes to automatically give it a position in results. Russia’s Zharov said he would monitor “how discriminating this measure will be in its practical embodiment,” Sputnik reported Tuesday. “It is obvious that we will defend our media,” he said. RT had received guaranteed ad revenue from YouTube until September, when the Google unit removed it as preferred partner. “We didn’t see this a few years ago,” Schmidt told the Halifax gathering about the propaganda. “We didn’t realize this could be so pervasive.” ","

Apple said in July it would spend around $950 million to build a center with a planned opening in 2019. If Google follows suit it would make the area one of the world’s largest data center hubs, the local municipality Aabenraa said. “This is great news,” Denmark’s energy minister Lars Christian Lilleholt told Reuters on Friday. “It signals that Google has plans in Denmark, and I think it’s because we have some of Europe’s lowest power prices for companies, some of the greenest energy, and a high security of supply,” he said in a telephone interview. Facebook in January announced plans to build a data center in Odense in central Denmark, its third outside of the United States. Besides its new 131 hectare (324 acres) plot in Aabenraa Google also owns a 73 plot in Fredericia, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Aabenraa. Google has no plans for the lots yet, but wanted to secure the possibility to expand its data centers in Europe if required, a spokeswoman told Reuters. ($1 = 6.3073 Danish crowns) ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"The streaming video service removed more than 50 user channels in the last week and stopped running ads on over 3.5 million videos since June, YouTube vice president Johanna Wright wrote in a blog post. “Across the board we have scaled up resources to ensure that thousands of people are working around the clock to monitor, review and make the right decisions across our ads and content policies,” Wright said. “These latest enforcement changes will take shape over the weeks and months ahead as we work to tackle this evolving challenge.” YouTube has become one of Google’s fastest-growing operations in terms of sales by simplifying the process of distributing video online but putting in place few limits on content. Parents, regulators, advertisers and law enforcement have become increasingly concerned about the open nature of the service. They have contended that Google must do more to banish and restrict access to inappropriate videos, whether it be propaganda from religious extremists and Russia or comedy skits that appear to show children being forcibly drowned. Concerns about children’s videos gained new force in the last two weeks after reports in BuzzFeed and the New York Times and an online essay by British writer James Bridle pointed out questionable clips. Several forum posts Wednesday showed support for YouTube’s actions while noting that vetting must expand even further. Common Sense Media, an organization that monitors children’s content online, did not immediately respond to a request to comment about YouTube’s announcement. YouTube’s Wright cited “a growing trend around content on YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not” for the new efforts “to remove them from YouTube.” The company relies on review requests from users, a panel of experts and an automated computer program to help its moderators identify material possibly worth removing. Moderators now are instructed to delete videos “featuring minors that may be endangering a child, even if that was not the uploader’s intent,” Wright said. Videos with popular characters “but containing mature themes or adult humor” will be restricted to adults, she said. In addition, commenting functionality will be disabled on any videos where comments refer to children in a “sexual or predatory” manner. ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc has pushed the launch of its HomePod smart speaker to early next year from December, the company said on Friday, missing the holiday shopping season as the market for such devices becomes increasingly competitive. “We can’t wait for people to experience HomePod ... but we need a little more time before it’s ready for our customers. We’ll start shipping in the U.S., UK and Australia in early 2018,” an Apple spokeswoman said via email. Apple introduced the voice-controlled HomePod in June. The speaker, which can make music suggestions and adjust home temperatures, takes aim at Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa feature and Echo devices. Apple has forecast between $84 billion and $87 billion in revenue for the holiday - mostly driven by sales of its $999 iPhone X - so it’s unlikely that missing a few weeks of sales of its $349 speaker will affect its financial results, Bob O’Donnell, founder of Technalysis Research, said. The indirect effects will have a stronger negative impact, he said. Apple is working to keep its Siri voice assistant relevant in the face of competition from Amazon’s Alexa and Alphabet Inc’s  Google Assistant, both of which are featured on smart speakers from those companies. People use voice assistants more often on smart speakers than on phones, so even if owners of Amazon or Google speakers  also have an iPhone, there’s a good chance that they’re talking to Alexa or Google Assistant as much or more than Siri. “Last holiday season, smart speakers were huge, and this season they’re going to be huge,” O’Donnell said. With Apple’s delay, “there will now be some people who make a different choice. The market’s getting more and more competitive.” Apple is also counting on HomePod to boost subscriptions to Apple Music and block the rise of rival Spotify. Smart speakers from Google and Amazon let users give voice commands to play Spotify, but Apple Music does not work on the rival devices. Apple’s main pitch for its HomePod smart speakers was superior audio quality, but that advantage appears to be slipping: Sonos, which also pitches its speakers’ audio quality for music lovers, now features support for the Alexa voice assistant. Earlier this year, Amazon announced the Echo Plus, a smart speaker with better audio quality, and Google confirmed to Reuters that its Home Max speaker with improved speakers will  ship in December, though it has not given a specific date. But Apple could still have a surprise or two in store. The company gave scant details about its speaker in June, leaving it room to announce exclusive music content or other unexpected features, said Brian Blau, an analyst with Gartner. “When HomePod comes out, you’ll probably hear some great content from artists that are familiar and popular, and there’s probably going to be some other special aspects as well,” he said.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Russian internet group Yandex is targeting a 50 percent share of the mobile search market in Russia after Google was forced to open up Android to rival search engines, CFO Greg Abovsky said on Thursday. “We’ll be happy with (a) market share of 50s in mobile, and in Russia that should blend to the high 50s,” Abovsky said at the Morgan Stanley European Tech, Media & Telecom Conference in Barcelona. The blended share would take into account Yandex’s higher market share of around two-thirds in desktop searches. In Russia Yandex leads the world’s biggest search engine, Alphabet Inc’s Google. But it has lagged for years on mobile devices as manufacturers of handsets running on Google’s popular Android operating system were blocked from installing services from Google’s competitors. Google agreed in April to open up its Android operating system to rival search engines in Russia as part of a deal to settle a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities. Yandex said in its earnings release last month that its search share on Android in Russia jumped to 41 percent in the third quarter from 38 percent three months earlier, while the blended share, including both mobile and desktop, averaged 55 percent. Abovsky said the search share on Android had already gone up to 45 percent and would rise further as every Android device will offer a choice of search windows from Jan. 1. Shares in Yandex have risen more than 30 percent since mid-April when the deal with Google was reached. ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.” Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices. ","

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up SenseTime Group, valued at more than $2 billion, is planning an IPO and aims to open a U.S. research and development center as early as next year, its founder told Reuters. The Hong Kong and Beijing-based deep learning firm founded by Tang Xiaoou, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, is a leader among Chinese AI start-ups that are enjoying fast growth amid demand from the government and private sector for their facial recognition technology. SenseTime provides applications for facial recognition, video analysis and other areas including autonomous driving. The three-year-old firm counts China’s Ministry of Public Security and local heavyweights such as China Mobile, HNA Group and Huawei Technologies as its major clients. “We are growing very fast, funding is never an issue. We can get as much as we want. Big-name investors are queuing to get in. So for us, we are not in a hurry to IPO. But at the right time, we definitely will,” said Tang. Hong Kong, the United States and China will be considered for an initial public offering, he added. “We don’t have a fixed timetable. It could be next year or the year after, depending on whether it makes business sense,” he said, adding SenseTime was also seeking a finance chief. Earlier, Reuters reported a latest funding round valued SenseTime at around $2 billion. Tang said the company was valued “above” that and an ongoing funding round would last until the end of 2017. But he would not reveal the amount being raised. Among its other investors are China’s CDH Investments and Sailing Capital. Tang said SenseTime planned to open a U.S. R&D unit as soon as early next year to work better with partners. He also said SenseTime, whose facial recognition error rate stands at 1/100 million, had won a $100 million deal to develop autonomous driving technology with a partner, which he declined to name. SenseTime has a training database of 2 billion faces and 10 billion images and videos. Several Chinese facial recognition start-ups have attracted large fundraising, helped by a government push to make China a world leader in AI. Guangzhou Cloudwalk Technology has recently received about $379 million in Series B funding, while Beijing-based Face++ last month raised $460 million. SenseTime is engaged in 14 sectors including medical imaging and high-performance computing, he said. “Our target is definitely not to create a small company to be acquired, but rather a ‘platform company’ that dominates with original core technology like Google and Facebook,” Tang said.

,11232017,Reuters,11162017,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Some European Union members are resisting EU plans to raise the tax bill of tech multinationals, EU draft documents seen by Reuters show, in moves that are likely to cause a public outcry after several disclosures of corporate tax avoidance schemes. EU finance ministers are expected to seal a preliminary deal on EU digital taxes when they meet on Dec. 6, after pressure from large states that accuse firms like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook of slashing their tax bills by rerouting their EU profits to low-tax countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland. France has openly called for an “equalisation tax” on the turnover of digital companies, aimed at leveling up the amount of tax they pay on their earnings compared with other types of companies. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, and the Estonian presidency of the EU have also backed a major tax overhaul. But EU envoys are gradually toning down the scale of the reform, according to documents seen by Reuters. An early draft of the finance ministers’ meeting conclusions, dated Nov. 6, said an equalisation levy “could be considered” as a temporary measure, before a wider tax overhaul. It also said the EU should not rule out adopting tax measures unilaterally if no deal was reached on a global level. But the most recent draft, dated Nov. 20, focuses on stressing the EU’s “preference for a global solution”. Global deals on tax reforms are seen as very difficult to achieve. Critics say that linking EU reforms to global agreements would postpone them indefinitely. Smaller EU countries, like Luxembourg or Malta, have said an EU solo move on corporate tax reform would damage its economy and favor competitors. The new draft has also softened the wording on the equalisation tax. A note of the Estonian presidency included in the text said that “views of delegations remain divided (..) in particular on the reference to an equalisation levy” with some states calling for it to be deleted. Disclosures of tax avoidance schemes by multinationals, like the LuxLeaks, Panama Papers and the most recent Paradise Papers, have increased public pressure for fairer corporate taxation. The EU’s tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici last week likened companies that evade taxes to “vampires” and called for quick action to counter tax avoidance schemes. The early draft of the ministers’ conclusions urged the development of a new method to calculate a corporate tax base so that companies with a “virtual permanent establishment” in a country could be taxed there. Currently corporate taxes are paid where firms have a physical presence, which allows large digital multinationals to book most of their profits in the low-tax countries where they have set up headquarters. The most recent draft said that this change should only be “explored” rather than developed. A note in the text said that some countries favored a further watering down. Talks among EU countries will continue in coming days and new draft texts are likely to be prepared, EU officials said, before the finance ministers’ meeting in December. ","

Earlier this week, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google and Mozilla announced that Google would be returning to the Firefox browser as the default search engine in the U.S. and Canada. The news comes almost exactly two years after Firefox switched from Google to Yahoo! (which is now owned by Verizon subsidiary Oath), and was included alongside the announcement for Firefox Quantum, the newest version of the browser. Mozilla relies almost entirely on these types of search partnerships, with the related royalties often comprising about 90% of revenue for the non-profit organization. For example, in its 2015 annual report (Mozilla has not yet released a 2016 annual report), it notes: Mozilla entered into a contract with a search engine provider for royalties which expired in November 2014. In December 2014, Mozilla entered into a contract with another search engine provider for royalties which expires December 2019. Approximately 90% of Mozilla's royalty revenues were derived from these contracts for 2015 and 2014 with receivables from these contracts representing approximately 75% and 77% of the December 31, 2015 and 2014 outstanding receivables, respectively. This snippet clearly refers to the switch from Google to Yahoo!, and Mozilla's total royalty revenue did jump 29% that year to $417 million, suggesting the Yahoo! partnership was working out well (at least financially). However, if Mozilla's deal with Yahoo! was set to last through December 2019, we're clearly not there yet. Google and Mozilla both declined to provide any financial details or terms surrounding the new partnership, which reportedly caught Verizon off guard. Image source: Getty Images. Does the win really make a difference for Google, though? Firefox has been declining in relevance for years, thanks in no small part to Google's own Chrome browser. Obviously, Google doesn't have to pay royalties to anyone for the search traffic that Chrome drives, which is why it was such a genius move in the first place to create Chrome nearly a decade ago. As of October 2017, FireFox had a 13% worldwide market share of internet browsers, compared to Chrome's 60%, according to NetMarketShare. That's a decent chunk of the browser market that's still worth going after. Perhaps more importantly, Firefox's share has remained mostly steady in recent years (albeit with some fluctuations), suggesting that Firefox still has a loyal user base that Google hasn't been able to win over with Chrome. Just like the old saying goes: If you can't beat 'em, license your search engine to 'em. Google's traffic acquisition costs (TAC) to distribution partners have been rising quite a bit lately, in part because of the ongoing shift toward mobile platforms. TAC to distribution partners soared 54% last quarter to $2.4 billion. Distribution partners include browser providers, among others. Apple is certainly benefiting from the fact that iOS does not allow any browser other than mobile Safari to be the default. Google could pay an estimated $3 billion to the Mac maker this year for the privilege of being mobile Safari's default search engine. Even without knowing the details, the Firefox deal will have modest financial implications due to the browser's limited market share, which is unlikely to fluctuate much even with the new Quantum version. Considering Firefox's small but stable share, Google might as well swoop in to grab that search traffic, too. ","

Conscious capitalism starts with the basic premise that a business can do good for its workers, the environment, and its shareholders, all at the same time. Conscious capitalism is built on four basic pillars: He names several companies as examples, including Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), all of which have produced market-beating returns while employing conscious-capitalist principles. Company What It's Known For Costco Providing low costs to customers without sacrificing the wellness of its employees. Alphabet (Google) Making information available and transparent, and crafting a workplace that encourages creative thinking and giving back. Starbucks Providing above-market pay and benefits for employees to foster a community its customers love to be part of. Let's look at just three of the many companies Mackey profiles and explore in greater detail what makes them conscious capitalists. The key to Costco's success is its ability to move inventory quickly, selling only what buyers want in quantities that allow it to offer the lowest prices on a per-ounce or per-unit basis. Low prices are, after all, what keeps customers coming back. But while Costco may be a penny-pincher when it comes to inventory, it doesn't cut corners when it comes to labor expense, or charitable giving in the communities in which it operates. In a business where efficiency is everything, long-term experienced employees are an asset to the franchise. The company starts employees at $13 per hour, far more than most retail chains, but its cashiers can advance and earn bonus compensation that brings their total compensation up to $56,000 per year. The vast majority of its employees enjoy healthcare benefits, too. That includes part-time employees, who start receiving benefits after just three months at the company. Costco writes about its unique approach to labor expense in its annual reports. Here's an example: With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Not surprisingly, Costco routinely ranks as one of the best retailers to work for, and it has shockingly low employee turnover. In any given year, the company loses only about 6% of its staff who have been at the retailer for more than a year. Customers can feel good knowing that its low prices that aren't coming at the cost of its employees' biweekly paycheck. Paying an above-market wage isn't just good for its employees, but it's good for business, too. Hiring is an expensive process, one most companies would prefer to avoid. And having experienced employees simply helps Costco be more productive. Its stores sold more than $1,175 of product per square foot last year, not including membership fees. That's a lot of 4-pound jelly bean tins. Google (now Alphabet) started with the basic premise that information should be readily available and open. Its founders believed that if they hired the best and brightest and took calculated bets with a long view in mind, it could make the world a better place while generating above-average returns for investors. Google found motivation in a simple goal. As Mackey wrote in his book, ""Google's original purpose was to organize the world's information and make it easily accessible and useful."" It's as simple as it is admirable, and customers love it. Google takes the No. 1 spot for internet traffic, as it is the portal through which most people find what they're looking for online. Mackey writes that Google's success is the by-product of many conscious-capitalist principles: The founders created a great place to work; team members are smart, empowered, innovative, very well looked after, and highly customer focused. They were clear about the kinds of investors they wanted to attract, clearly laying out their business philosophy in their prospectus. Google had a wonderful philanthropic strategy for its community stakeholders, and it implemented the strategy before its initial public offering, setting aside 1% of the company's stock for the Google Foundation, and pledging to contribute 1% of profits to the foundation annually. Google.org has funded projects that are both good for the world and, frankly, good for Google. It supports an initiative called BRAID (Building, Recruiting, And Inclusion for Diversity) to increase the percentage of women and students of color who major in computer science. It also supports Code for America, which helps connect America's job seekers with training and job search support to fight poverty. These projects help make the world a better place by training people for high-paying jobs, some of whom will ultimately decide to take a job at Google. It's not all about job training, though. Google.org has invested heavily in worldwide education efforts to lift people in frontier markets out of poverty. These are the kind of initiatives that everyone -- employees, communities, and shareholders -- benefit from being part of. Starbucks knows that coffee is just a commodity. There has to be something special to keep people engaged and coming back for another $4 cup. Customers look to Starbucks as their ""third place,"" a place of comfort outside home and work. As Mackey wrote in his book, Starbucks creates a community by encouraging employee loyalty with autonomy, high pay, and lucrative employee benefits: When it provides health benefits to its part-time workers (spending more on healthcare than it does on coffee), the team members clearly win. Customers win from having more engaged and caring team members, such as baristas who remember their names and the details of their orders. Starbucks is successful because it captured a large portion of the market, and expanded the coffeehouse industry as a whole. It also led the charge on important environmental concerns that are important to its customers. In 1999, it started a ""Grounds for Your Garden"" project to provide free used coffee grounds to anyone who wanted them for composting. In 2006, it started using recycled paper in its cups to reduce waste. Last year, the company unveiled a plan to donate 100% of all unsold food from its stores to local food banks and pantries. These initiatives are good for both shareholders and the business alike, as customers feel good about buying their favorite drinks from the Seattle-based coffee chain. Note that the company spent less than 2% of its revenue on marketing last year, a pittance compared to many food and drink businesses. Even negative attention has been good for the brand. Remember the firestorm that erupted when Starbucks changed its classic Christmastime cup? Some saw it as a ""war on Christmas."" But the outrage stands as a testament to just how important Starbucks is to its customers. How many companies play such an intimate role in daily lives of so many people that changing the disposable, seasonal packaging becomes a headline event? Starbucks may be the only one.

Making the world a better place doesn't have to be grandiose; it can be something as simple as caring about your customers. In his book, Mackey writes about how Amazon.com has been successful because it cares more about its customers than perhaps any other retailer, writing that Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, goes so far to put an empty chair in every meeting to remind participants that the customer is important, even if the customers aren't in attendance. To be sure, some companies have been successful even though their business models arguably make the world worse than the day before. Tobacco companies sell a dangerous and addictive product that kill millions of people each year. Nonetheless, tobacco stocks top the list of the world's best-performing stocks over almost any time period. Likewise, not all of the companies Mackey specifically mentions have gone on to duplicate their historical success. Retailers Nordstrom and The Container Store, which are championed in the book, have arguably been disrupted in a big way by another conscious capitalist, Amazon. ","

Whether they're looking for drones, smart home products, wearable tech, or a myriad of other gifts, this list is sure to have something to make them smile. Image source: Google. Let's start with something small yet packed with tech wizardry: the new Google Home Max smart speaker. This is the high-end version of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home speaker. Not only can it answer nearly any question you throw at it, but it knows how to drop the beat. Google Home Max comes with Google Assistant, the voice-enabled virtual assistant that can answer questions, control other smart home devices (like a Nest thermostat or adjustable lights), change the speaker's volume, tell you a joke, play song requests, and much more -- all through simple voice commands. It's easy enough for anyone to use, but for a tech-savvy person who uses a lot of apps and has a few smart home devices, the possibilities are endless. The Home Max will sell for $399 and will come with 12 months of ad-free YouTube Music. It's not available just yet, but you can join a waitlist to be notified as soon as it's for sale. Image source: Apple. Sure, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartwatch has been out for a few years now, but the new Series 3 adds cellular connectivity for the first time -- something technophiles have been wanting from the Apple Watch for a while. The cellular connection allows you to make calls, stream music, and use Siri to send text messages without tethering the Watch to an iPhone. The Watch is also water-resistant to 50 meters and comes with an array of motion sensors, an ultra-fast Apple W2 processor, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, GPS, and an 18-hour battery life. The 38 mm Watch with GPS and cellular starts at $399, while the 42 mm version starts at $429. Image source: DJI. Drones are all the rage these days, and the new DJI Mavic Pro Platinum is one of the best portable drones on the market. The Mavic Pro Platinum is foldable, making it perfect for traveling. It has a 12 megapixel camera that records video in ultra-high-definition 4K. The remote control has a range of up to 4.3 miles, and the battery will last for up to 30 minutes of flight -- that is, if it's not in ""sport mode,"" where it can reach speeds of 40 miles per hour. The Mavic Pro Platinum also comes with the DJI's FlightAutonomy technology, which allows the drone to see obstacles up to 49 feet away and avoid them autonomously. All of these features and more are packed into a drone that measures 13 inches across (when not folded) and weighs 1.6 pounds. Of course, drones of this caliber don't come cheap, and this particular model costs about $1,099. That makes the Mavic Pro Platinum a good gift for a dear loved one who is both tech-savvy and adventurous enough to appreciate its impressive capabilities. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) says its new Xbox One X is the most powerful gaming console ever made, and the device has the specs to back that claim up. The console has 4K Ultra HD video graphics and high dynamic range (HDR) technology for superior colors, which means you can play games and stream movies or TV shows with some of the highest video resolutions and color ranges available today. You can also play Ultra HD Blu-Ray discs on the console, but keep in mind that you need a 4K TV to get the full experience. The Xbox One X is a huge leap forward from its predecessor, with a new eight-core AMD processor, double the memory, and a far more powerful graphics processor. An optional headset enables you to give voice commands to Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant, which can open games, scroll through menus, and play back video, and more. Expect to shell out about $500 for the Xbox One X right now. Image source: Apple. Apple's newest iPhone has garnered lots of attention for its $999 base price tag, but the cost comes with some remarkable features. First is the edge-to-edge, 5.8-inch OLED display. Pushing the screen out to all of the iPhone's edges is a first for Apple, and it allowed the company to expand the screen without making the phone itself much bigger. The iPhone X's second killer feature is its FaceID facial recognition. You can unlock the device just by looking at it, and third-party developers are already creating new apps to take advantage of the technology. The newest iPhone comes packed with Apple's new A11 processor, which delivers better-than-ever speed, graphics, and computing power. Its 12 megapixel camera has both a wide-angle and telephoto lens (with portrait mode), as well as the ability to shoot video in 4K. The iPhone X is pricey, but all of these features back up its hefty price tag. Image source: Apple. If you're looking for a great pair of high-tech wireless earphones, but you don't want to bust your holiday budget, then the $99 BeatsX earphones are a great bet. The BeatsX comes packed with Apple's W1 chip -- the same one found in Apple's more expensive AirPods -- which allows the BeatsX to pair with an iPhone much faster than it would through a Bluetooth connection (though Bluetooth is still available if you don't have an iPhone). The chip also helps improve battery life: The BeatsX can last for eight hours of continual use, and a five-minute charge will get you two hours of playback. These earphones received solid reviews from both The Verge and CNET this year, and testers have praised its sound quality, comfort, design, and value. The neckband style (it has a wire that connects the two earphones together) may not be for everyone, but the device's internal specs are sure to please any tech-savvy person on your list. Image source: Nintendo. There's already a gaming console on this list, but the Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY)Switch deserves to be here just as much as the Xbox One X. No, the Switch doesn't have high-end 4K video resolution, but what it lacks in visuals it makes up for in portability. That's because the Switch is designed to transform from a home gaming console to a handheld device in just seconds. It's essentially a 6.2-inch tablet that has detachable controllers that slide onto either side of the Switch when you're on the go. When you get back home, the tablet slides into a docking station and switches (get it?) into a full-fledged HD gaming system. The Switch costs $300, which is a great deal for such a versatile gaming system. Image source: Roku. Finally, if you're looking for an inexpensive way to give your friend's TV a huge tech upgrade, then you should take look at Roku's (NASDAQ:ROKU) $70 Streaming Stick+. The device is small enough to take on trips, it streams video content in 4K, and it's compatible with HDR images for superior color quality. The great thing about Roku's streaming device is that you get access to the usual content suspects -- Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, etc. -- but you can also tap into thousands of other streaming apps as well. Roku's Streaming Stick+ comes with a quad-core processor, it discreetly plugs into the back of your TV, and the voice-enabled remote allows you to search for shows just by talking to it. You can also control the power and volume on your TV right from the Roku remote (no more searching for separate remotes!). If all of that isn't enticing enough, Roku is taking $20 off of the Streaming Stick+ price during the Black Friday weekend. ","

"Brian Stoffel, Timothy Green, and Tyler Crowe",11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. That's not easy to do. So today, three Motley Fool investors tell you about three stocks that you can buy and should hold for decades. Read on to find out why McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), HCP (NYSE:HCP) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- better known as the parent company to Google -- all make the list. Tim Green (McDonald's): Few restaurant chains find the formula for decades-long success. Competition is fierce, consumer tastes are constantly evolving, and missteps can tarnish a brand for years. McDonald's, which not too long ago was struggling with declining sales, is now putting up strong numbers, driven by initiatives such as all-day breakfast and a deeper focus on providing value to its customers. The company's ability to adapt makes it a stock to own for the long run. The company's third-quarter results look out of place during a time when many restaurant chains are struggling to attract customers. Global comparable sales jumped 6%, while U.S. comparable sales rose 4.1%. The company's refranchising efforts led to a revenue drop, but adjusted earnings per share increased by 9% year over year. Beyond menu changes, McDonald's is embracing technology. The company's mobile app, which features digital coupons, is driving customers to its restaurants and creating incremental sales. McDonald's also offers mobile ordering through its app and delivery through UberEats. It needs to win on both value and convenience. It's doing just that with these initiatives. Shares of McDonald's have surged this year, so the stock is far from a bargain. But if you're a long-term investor able to ignore the ups and downs of the market, the fast-food king is a good bet. Tyler Crowe (HCP Inc.): The baby boomer generation is at the age of retirement, which is causing a massive shift in U.S. demographics. Between now and 2030, the 75-and-older cohort of Americans is expected to grow by more than 50% to just under 10% of the total population. The reason that's important for real estate investment trust HCP is that average annual healthcare spending tends to skyrocket after age of 65. That's not just doctor or hospital visits, either. That includes services such as assisted living and senior housing, a market on which HCP is betting heavily. According to HCP, the market value of all U.S. healthcare-related real estate is around $1.1 trillion, and it's likely to grow as people are living longer and baby boomers get on in years. Just to give an example, the senior-housing market should grow by 40% between now and 2030, which gives HCP and other healthcare related REITs a massive investment opportunity over the next decade in just one segment of the market. That doesn't include other healthcare properties such as medical offices and life-sciences laboratories that are core holdings at HCP Over the past year or so, HCP's management has reconfigured its buisness to prepare for this massive investment opportunity. It spun off its skilled-nursing and acute-care properties last year, it's diversifying its tenants, and it is improving debt metrics to get an investment-grade rating. All of these things should better position HCP to capture this multi-decade opportunity. As a REIT, HCP is already a high-yield dividend stock that has a reasonable payout for the industry. With demographic trends on its side, this looks like a stock you can hold for a long time. Brian Stoffel (Alphabet): One of the reasons Google changed its name to Alphabet was to put a focus on its ""other bets"" outside the core Google search and advertising juggernaut. Even without these side projects -- which I'll get to in a second -- Alphabet is a worthy investment. The company has an unmatched data set -- which is helping it dominate the transition to online advertising. It has a war chest of $107 billion against ""just"" $3 billion in long-term debt. And over the past year, it has produced $24 billion in free cash flow -- almost solely thanks to the advertising business. But it's the company's moonshots -- experiments with products that could drastically change the way we live -- that are a the real reason to hold for decades. While the likelihood that any one moonshot will be a success is slim (hello, Google Glass 1.0), all it takes is one project to ""hit"" to notably move the needle for investors. Increasingly, it's looking as if Waymo -- Alphabet's self-driving-car initiative -- might be the first major hit. No matter how it plays out, however, you can only be exposed to this potential if you buy and are willing to hold shares over the long run. ","
      
    3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades -- The Motley Fool

Wendy Connick,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Like IRAs and 401(k)s, the HSA contribution limits are pegged to inflation and can rise from year to year. And given the fantastic advantages that a health savings account can offer, it's definitely a good idea to max out those contribution limits. So I'm happy to say that the HSA limits for 2018 have gone up compared to the 2017 limits. A health savings account, or HSA, is a tax-advantaged account designed to be paired with a high deductible health insurance policy. The HSA allows its holder to tuck away the money he may need for medical expenses, and provides a triple tax advantage: HSA owners get a tax break on the money they contribute to the account, the contents of the account are exempt from capital gains and other investment taxes, and any money taken out to pay qualified medical expenses is also not taxed. There are two different sets of contribution limits for HSAs: one for account holders with self-only coverage (meaning that the high deductible health insurance policy paired with the HSA provides coverage only for the individual holding the account), and another for account holders with family coverage. For 2018, the contribution limit for self-only HSAs is $3,450 per year. The contribution limit for family coverage HSAs is $6,900 per year. If you're age 55 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution to your HSA. Contribute more than the annual limit and you'll be charged an extra 6% tax on the excess, plus you won't be able to deduct those over-limit contributions. You can avoid the 6% penalty by withdrawing the excess contribution -- and any earnings (i.e. interest) on the extra money -- by the date on which your tax return is due, typically April 15 of the following year. You'll also need to declare any earnings you withdrew on your Form 1040 as ""other income."" Image source: Getty Images. If you want a health savings account, not just any old health insurance policy will do. You'll have to get an HSA-compatible high deductible health insurance policy. In order to qualify in 2018, your health insurance policy must have a deductible of at least $1,350 per year for self-only coverage, or $2,700 per year for family plans. Also, annual out-of-pocket expenses on your policy cannot exceed $6,650 for self-only plans or $13,300 for family plans. Finally, the insurance policy must be HSA-compatible, meaning that the plan's providers have agreed to meet reporting and other requirements for health savings accounts. Once you have both an HSA-compatible health insurance policy and the account itself, you can start funding your HSA. Because the tax benefits that these accounts offer are so extraordinary, it's a good idea to contribute as much money as you can to the account. Even if you don't end up spending it all on medical expenses, once you turn 65 you can use any money in the account for any purpose at all -- which makes your HSA a kind of supplementary retirement account as well as a healthcare funding account. At the very least, keep at least enough in your HSA to cover a full year's deductible on your health insurance policy. That will protect you from any major medical expenditures that might arise. When choosing your HSA, be sure to pick a provider who will allow you to invest the money, not just stick it in a savings account. The much higher average returns you can get from stocks and bonds will help your money to grow far faster than the measly interest offered on a bank savings account. However, it's a good idea to keep part of your HSA balance in cash so that if you need money in a hurry to pay for an unexpected medical expense, you can get at it quickly and easily. ","
      
    What are the HSA Contribution Limits for 2018? -- The Motley Fool

Selena Maranjian,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many of us daydream about retiring early -- and then assume that we can't. It's true that if you're way behind in saving up for retirement, you may have to toil for longer than you'd like. But early retirement is more possible for many people than they think, and Social Security can be a big help toward that end. Here's a look at why you might want to start collecting Social Security at age 62. Image source: Getty Images. The Social Security Administration assigns each of us a ""full"" retirement age at which we can start collecting our full benefits. For those born in 1937 or earlier, it's 65, for those born in 1960 or later, it's 67, and for those born between 1937 and 1960, it's somewhere in between. Regardless of your full retirement age, you're allowed to start receiving your Social Security retirement benefits early as age 62 or as late as age 70. Most people start collecting Social Security at age 62 -- and there are some compelling reasons why you should do the same. The size of your ultimate Social Security checks is not written in stone. You can make them fatter or slimmer through timing. For every year beyond your full retirement age that you delay starting to collect your benefits (up to age 70), your benefits will increase in value by about 8%. Delay from 67 to 70, for example, and you can make your checks fully 24% bigger. If you would have started collecting about $2,000 per month ($24,000 per year) at 67, you can instead start with around $2,480 per month (or nearly $30,000 annually) at age 70. That may seem like the obviously smartest thing to do, but it may not be. As the Social Security Administration has explained, ""If you live to the average life expectancy for someone your age, you will receive about the same amount in lifetime benefits no matter whether you choose to start receiving benefits at age 62, full retirement age, age 70 or any age in between."" In other words, for those with average life spans, it's a wash. After all, if you delay starting to collect from age 67 to 70, you will miss out on three years' worth of payments (albeit smaller ones) -- that's 36 payments. Meanwhile, if you start collecting at 62, your benefits may be up to about 30% smaller. Don't let that sway you too much, though. Remember -- starting to collect at 62 instead of 70 will give you smaller checks, but you'll receive eight more years' worth of checks -- 96 more of them. Image source: Getty Images. While it's great to start collecting benefits early, will they be enough to sustain you? It depends on how much money you'll need in retirement. Social Security income is critical to most retirees, but it's not enough for most folks. The average monthly retirement benefit was recently $1,408, which amounts to $16,896 per year. If your earnings have been above average, you'll collect more than that -- up to the maximum monthly Social Security benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age, which was recently $2,788. (That's about $33,500 for the whole year.) You can use the imperfect but still-helpful 4% rule to help you roughly estimate how much income you might get from your nest egg -- the various retirement accounts you have. The rule suggests that you can withdraw 4% of your nest egg in your first year of retirement, adjusting future withdrawals for inflation, in order to make your money last through retirement. (It assumes a portfolio that's 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, and it's designed to make your money last through 30 years.) The table below will give you a rough idea of how much you might withdraw in your first year of retirement from nest eggs of various sizes: Retirement Nest Egg 4% Withdrawal $100,000 $4,000 $250,000 $10,000 $500,000 $20,000 $750,000 $30,000 $1 million $40,000 $1.25 million $50,000 $1.5 million $60,000 Source: Author calculations. Note that you might take out smaller withdrawals to play it safer, and you might have some of your nest egg in solid dividend-paying stocks that pay you a certain percentage without requiring the selling of any shares. If you have, say, $400,000 invested in stocks with an average overall dividend yield of 3%, you're looking at $12,000 in dividend income for the year -- $1,000 per month. If your nest egg isn't as flush as it should be, you may be able to fatten it up by turbocharging your saving and investing over the next few years. Here's the kind of additional money you might generate: Growing at 8% for $10,000 Invested Annually $15,000 Invested Annually $20,000 Invested Annually 3 years $35,061 $52,592 $70,122 5 years $63,359 $95,039 $126,719 10 years $156,455 $234,682 $312,910 15 years $293,243 $439,864 $586,486 Calculations by author. Since few of us have much of an idea of how long we'll live, it's well worth considering retiring early if you can in order to enjoy as many work-free years as possible. Many people don't even really get to decide just when to retire -- fate decides for them. The 2017 Retirement Confidence Survey found that 48% of retirees left the workforce earlier than planned, with 41% citing health problems or a disability as the reason and 26% citing changes at work such as a downsizing or workplace closure. Better still, the younger you are when you retire, the more active you can be in retirement, at least in the first bunch of years. If you want to play a lot of tennis or want to take up ballroom dancing lessons or plant a big garden or trek up to Machu Picchu, it will be much easier to do when you're 65 than when you're 75. Early retirees often can enjoy their retirement more, being younger, healthier, and more able to be active, travel, and so on. Don't jump into an early retirement without being sure you can afford it -- and don't forget to factor in healthcare costs, either, as they can be hefty. But if you can swing it, give early retirement some serious consideration. Social Security lets you start collecting monthly checks at age 62, and that's just what you might want to do. ","
      
    Why Smart People Take Social Security at 62 -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Paying for healthcare is a challenge for retirees, and although Medicare provides a lot of help, the alphabet soup of Medicare coverage can take some effort to figure out. Medicare Part B is a crucial component of how retirees get the everyday healthcare that they need. To answer some of the questions that older Americans frequently have about the program, here are some of the key provisions of Medicare Part B and how you can use it to cover the expenses of doctor visits and other outpatient treatment needs. Part B coverage for medical services requires Medicare participants to pay a monthly premium. For 2018, the premium that most participants will pay is $134 per month. About a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries will qualify to pay a lower amount due to unusually low cost-of-living increases in their Social Security payments over the past several years. The hold-harmless provision under Medicare and Social Security limits Medicare premium increases to the amount by which a participant's Social Security checks go up. Although most participants will have seen their monthly benefits catch up to Medicare premium increases by the time 2018 cost-of-living increases take effect in January, those who don't will get their Part B coverage at a discounted premium. There is also a means test that requires some people to pay higher premiums for their Part B coverage. Depending on your income, premiums can be as much as $428.60 per month. For individuals with this income: Or joint filers with this income: Total monthly premium in 2018 will be: $85,000 to $107,000 $170,000 to $214,000 $187.50 $107,000 to $133,500 $214,000 to $267,000 $267.90 $133,500 to $160,000 $267,000 to $320,000 $348.30 Over $160,000 Over $320,000 $428.60 Data source: Medicare. You'll also have to pay deductibles and coinsurance amounts in addition to premium payments. The deductible for Part B is $183 per year. You're responsible for paying that amount out of your own pocket before Medicare starts providing coverage, and after that, Medicare typically covers 80% of most services that Part B covers, leaving you with the remaining 20%. There are exceptions to this rule for certain preventive services for which Part B pays the entire amount. The key to Medicare Part B coverage is that any service or treatment must be medically necessary in order to treat a disease or medical condition. Services necessary to diagnose conditions are eligible, as are treatments to cure problems, prevent an illness from occurring in the first place, or detect early onset of a potential medical problem. The most common use of Medicare Part B among participants is to visit one's doctor. Medical diagnostic tests as part of one's ordinary treatment are also typical charges. Part B covers a wider range of items, ranging from ambulance services, clinical research, and durable medical equipment to mental-health services and second opinions for surgical operations. Image source: Getty Images. When you first join Medicare, you can also take advantage of a one-time initial preventive visit. Referred to as a ""Welcome to Medicare"" visit, you'll get a doctor to review your medical history and assess key health characteristics such as height, weight, blood pressure, and a calculation of your body mass index. The visit also includes a vision test and an assessment of depression risk, and you'll receive a written plan from your doctor that tells you which screenings, shots, and other preventive services you'll need to get. After that, Medicare also provides yearly wellness visits to keep your vital information up to date. Part B doesn't cover everything. In particular, Medicare won't pay the cost of dentures and most dental care, and you can't get coverage for eye examinations related to prescribing glasses or contact lenses. Hearing-aid examinations also typically aren't provided. If you're ever confused about whether Medicare will cover a specific healthcare need, you can find out easily. A tool on the Medicare website will tell you whether a test, service, or medical device is included in coverage. You can also turn to your doctor or medical professional to find out whether Medicare will cover their recommended treatment. Medicare Part B gives retirees the healthcare coverage they need, and a full range of necessary services is available to participants. These services, though, come at a cost, and it's crucial to understand exactly what you'll be on the hook to pay so that you don't get any nasty surprises in your retirement. ","

Medical marijuana has never been more popular. And neither have medical marijuana stocks. With 29 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and a growing number of nations across the world now permitting legal use of cannabis for medical purposes, many investors are eager to pour money into the best companies in the industry. There are quite a few alternatives available for investing in medical marijuana. Many of them are penny stocks of tiny companies that aren't great choices for most investors. Several, though, are stocks of relatively large companies with significant growth potential. Five of the very best medical marijuana stocks on the market today are Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE:CGC), Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), MedReleaf (NASDAQOTH:MEDFF), Aphria (NASDAQOTH:APHQF), and Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON). Here's what makes these stocks stand out. Image source: Getty Images. Canopy Growth's medical marijuana sales in Canada are rapidly growing. The company has also made a big push to expand internationally, with subsidiaries or partnerships in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Jamaica, and Spain. Canopy Growth's best news of all, though, is that it should be in a great position to profit from legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada in 2018. Aurora Cannabis is the second-largest medical marijuana stock, with a market cap of around $2 billion. However, the company could soon surpass Canopy Growth in size. Aurora intends to acquire another Canadian medical marijuana grower, CanniMed Therapeutics. If the deal goes through, the combined entity would likely be valued at more than $3 billion. Like Canopy Growth, Aurora is eyeing international markets. The company's subsidiary Pedanios is going through the regulatory process to become a licensed producer of medical cannabis in Germany. In addition, Aurora owns nearly 20% of a company that supplies medical cannabis in Australia. Also like Canopy Growth, Aurora could see a huge revenue opportunity with Canadian legalization of recreational marijuana next year. MedReleaf's market cap stands at around $1.2 billion. Even though its valuation is smaller than that of Aurora Cannabis, the company's sales are greater and trail only Canopy Growth among the leading medical marijuana growers. Why isn't MedReleaf stock worth more than it is? The company's sales growth hasn't been nearly as impressive as its peers. This relatively sluggish growth stems in large part from MedReleaf's reliance on sales of dried cannabis, which don't command the premium prices that cannabidiol (CBD) products do. However, MedReleaf claims one of the lowest cost structures in the industry, which should position the company very well to compete when Canada opens up the market for legalized recreational marijuana. Aphria comes in slightly behind MedReleaf in market cap, with the company currently valued around $1 billion. In terms of revenue, though, Aphria has been well below both Canopy Growth and MedReleaf. However, its sales have routinely topped those of Aurora Cannabis. One thing that sets Aphria apart from its peers is the company's focus on the U.S. market. Aphria forged a deal over the summer that gave it a foothold in the medical marijuana market for Florida. And while Florida represents around 14% of the total medical marijuana market in the U.S., the state is probably just the beginning for Aphria's southern strategy. The company plans to expand into other U.S. states that have legalized use of medical cannabis. Cronos Group is the smallest of these medical marijuana stocks, with a market cap of around $475 million. And unlike all of the other companies mentioned, Cronos Group is an investment company rather than a marijuana grower itself. But the company's focus is definitely on medical marijuana. Three small Canadian marijuana growers are 100% owned by Cronos Group: In the Zone Produce, Peace Naturals and Original BC. Cronos also owns a 21.5% stake in Whistler Medical Marijuana Company as well as smaller positions in several other marijuana growers, including Canopy Growth. Although Cronos Group has a different business model than the others on the list, its opportunities are similar. The company anticipates growth both in Canada and internationally, especially in the German market. If you're looking to invest in medical marijuana, I think these five stocks are the best on the market. However, there are significant risks of which investors should be aware. Image source: Getty Images. The most glaring risk is valuation. Each of these stocks is priced at stratospheric levels. Cronus Group is the most expensive, with shares trading at nearly 130 times sales. Aurora Cannabis isn't far behind, with a price-to-sales multiple of 129. Canopy Growth follows, with shares trading at 73 times sales. Aphria's sales multiple is 60. And while MedReleaf is the cheapest of the group, the stock still trades at nearly 35 times sales. These sky-high valuations reflect expectations of astronomical growth for each of these stocks. While the medical marijuana companies should enjoy tremendous growth from legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada and continued international expansion, there's a real possibility that the growth could fail to meet the lofty expectations of investors. Aphria, in particular, faces two other risks. Because of the company's focused effort to expand in the U.S., Aphria's expansion plans could be derailed if the U.S. Department of Justice decided to crack down in states that have legalized medical marijuana in violation of federal laws. Also, the Toronto Stock Exchange, on which all five of these medical marijuana stocks are listed, issued a notice in October that companies with stocks listed on the exchange that engage in ongoing business activities in violation of U.S. federal laws related to marijuana are not in compliance with listing requirements. It's possible that companies such as Aphria that are actively working to sell medical marijuana in the U.S. could have their stocks delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Even with medical marijuana taking off like never before, the risks of investing in the industry shouldn't be ignored. ","

Steve Symington,11232017,Fool,11162017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Raven Industries (NASDAQ:RAVN) released impressive fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Nov. 21 after the market closed. The mini-industrial conglomerate enjoyed sustained momentum across its businesses, including a particularly strong quarter from the engineered films segment following the severe hurricane season, as well as the launch of a new companywide initiative to revamp its approach to enterprise resource planning. Let's take a closer look at how Raven Industries kicked off the second half, as well as what investors can expect from the company in the coming quarters. Image source: Raven Industries. Fiscal Q3 2018* Fiscal Q3 2017 Year-Over-Year Growth Revenue $101.3 million $72.5 million 39.7% Net income $12.0 million $5.7 million 110.6% Earnings per diluted share $0.33 $0.16 106.3% Data source: Raven Industries. *For the quarter ended Oc. 31, 2017. ""We are very pleased with the performance achieved by all three operating divisions throughout the first nine months of the year,"" stated Raven Industries CEO Dan Rykhus. ""Each division has worked to optimize performance given their specific end market conditions, and each has achieved success."" As a reminder, Raven Industries doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance. But Rykhus did offer some forward-looking perspective on each segment. For starters, the company doesn't see current market headwinds abating for the applied technology segment over the next year. But in the meantime, as mentioned, the company has opted to make strategic investments to drive market share and foster the segment's longer-term growth. ""We believe strongly in the long-term margin potential"" for the applied technology division, Rykhus explained, ""and we expect improved margins over time with these investments, even if end-market conditions remain challenging."" Next, he noted that the early integration of CLI into engineered films is ""going very well"" and predicted that the acquisition should be accretive to this year's earnings to the tune of $0.05 per share. Further, Raven expects hurricane-related catalysts to continue in the near term, with hurricane recovery film sales of $8 million to $9 million in the fourth quarter. Finally, Aerostar is rightly celebrating its 197-day stratospheric balloon duration record, its continued positive relationship with Project Loon, and the ongoing diversification of its business with the new Department of Defense contract. Most of the latter contract will be recognized in fiscal 2019. In the end, there was little not to like about the broad strength Raven demonstrated this quarter. ","

Christine Burroni,11232017,MarketWatch,11162017,"Published: Nov 18, 2017 2:07 p.m. ET By Social media has unleashed on Lena Dunham for her decision to defend a “Girls” producer accused of rape. “You wrote me an email of support a few weeks ago and now you defend a rapist? WTF @lenadunham?” tweeted actress Asia Argento, who is now one of the dozens of women who have accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. You wrote me an email of support a few weeks ago and now you defend a rapist? WTF @lenadunham? https://t.co/UGZwpr9ap3 Dunham and her co-showrunner Jenni Konner released a joint statement on Friday defending producer Murray Miller who has been accused of raping actress Aurora Perrineau when she was 17. He was 35 at the time of the alleged incident. “While our first instinct is to listen to every woman’s story, our insider knowledge of Murray’s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3% of assault cases that are misreported every year,” Dunham and Konner wrote in a joint statement. “It is a true shame to add to that number, as outside of Hollywood women still struggle to be believed. We stand by Murray and this is all we’ll be saying about this issue.” See also: How late is too late to take a legal case against someone for sexual assault?

Laura Landro,11232017,MarketWatch,11162017,"Published: Nov 22, 2017 11:31 a.m. ET The hidden disease of the middle-aged By Liver disease is on the rise among middle-aged Americans, but many don’t know they have it—or that they could develop it. The liver performs critical jobs, including cleaning toxins from the blood, storing energy and nutrients, digesting fats and processing medications, alcohol and food. But a host of ills and abuses can wreak havoc on the liver, from heavy drinking and infection with hepatitis B or C to a scourge known as fatty-liver disease linked to diabetes and obesity. Over time, the liver can become fibrous and scarred, eventually developing cirrhosis, the replacement of normal tissue with hard tissue. The damage that occurs increases the risk for liver cancer. A September report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that death rates for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis rose 31% among those age 45 to 64 between 2000 and 2015. And cases of liver cancer rose more than 20% in the U.S. between 1990 and 2015. Yet liver diseases often have no symptoms until they are far advanced, making it all the more important to identify and test those at risk. “With baby boomers, we may focus on heart disease, dementia and cancer, and don’t always think about the liver,” says Dr. Anna S. Lok, director of hepatology at the University of Michigan and president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. There are new drugs that cure hepatitis C, and a number of treatments are in development for advanced fatty-liver disease. Getting and staying sober can reverse liver damage caused by alcohol, and losing weight can reverse damage caused by nonalcoholic liver disease. “The liver is very forgiving and can bounce back even in early stages of cirrhosis,” says Lok. Once cirrhosis is advanced, however, the only option is a liver transplant, which can be hard to come by. There are new treatments for liver cancer if diagnosed early, so screening cirrhosis patients for liver cancer is important, she says. According to a study published last month in JAMA Oncology, the rise in liver cancer in the U.S. is partially due to hepatitis C infection in baby boomers. An estimated 1 in 30 have been infected with the virus, the second-leading cause of cirrhosis. Hepatitis C was often transmitted during medical treatment before infection-control procedures were widely adopted, or from blood transfusions before 1992, when screening for the virus virtually eliminated such risks. It also is spread among intravenous-drug users, even with just one use, and from unsterile tools at tattoo parlors. Read:  How binge-drinking in college could affect the rest of your life In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a one-time hepatitis C test for all adults born between 1945 and 1965. But fewer than 30% have actually been tested, according to estimates. Doctors may fail to ask patients about past medical procedures or drug-use history, and patients may either be unaware of possible medical exposures or be hesitant to mention risky behavior such as intravenous-drug use. “Patients who are now respectable citizens may not want to tell their doctors, ‘I was a crazy teen back in the ’60s,’ ” Lok says. To eliminate such barriers, Lok and colleagues have designed an electronic-health-record alert that prompts primary-care physicians to perform such screenings if patients who are baby boomers haven’t yet been diagnosed or tested. In a study published in the journal Hepatology in September, the team said hepatitis C testing rates increased fivefold, to 72% among those born between 1945 and 1965, in the year after the electronic alerts were launched. Of 53 newly diagnosed patients, 11 had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, 20 started treatment and so far nine have been cured. The first sign of liver disease may be elevated liver enzymes in a blood test. Dr. Elliot Tapper, an assistant professor at University of Michigan who treats patients at its clinics and at the Ann Arbor VA hospital, says issues related to alcohol, obesity and diabetes are the most likely cause, followed by hepatitis B or C. Tests for such conditions should be used first, including an ultrasound of the liver to look for fatty-liver disease. If patients disclose they drink excessively or use intravenous drugs, or are taking a drug or dietary supplement that can cause liver damage, the need for more invasive tests such as liver biopsies to test for rarer conditions falls sharply, Tapper says. Also read:  New rules for exercising if you’re over 50 Fatty-liver disease, a buildup of fat in the liver, affects as many as 100 million Americans, especially those in their 40s and 50s, but also strikes children and young adults. The disease can lead to a progressive form known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, which can cause scarring that leads to cirrhosis and increases the risk of heart disease, Tapper says. Genetic variations may make some people more vulnerable. While liver biopsies are still used to definitively diagnose liver diseases and determine their stage, noninvasive tests using different types of scans and imaging technology such as MRI are becoming more widely used. A 2015 study of 100 patients, using such technology, showed that almost two-thirds with Type 2 diabetes have evidence of nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease, while more than 7% have advanced fibrosis. Study author Dr. Rohit Loomba, director of hepatology and a research center devoted to nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease at the University of California, San Diego, says follow-up studies aim to determine whether such technology is cost-effective for wide use. Until such screening methods are better established, he says, doctors should assess their patients with classic risk factors for fatty-liver disease—those in their 40s and 50s at high risk of heart disease because of obesity and diabetes. Fatty-liver disease is also closely linked to metabolic syndrome, a group of abnormalities that include increased belly fat, high blood pressure and high blood levels of triglycerides, a type of fat. Don’t miss:  Still not losing weight? These may be the reasons why “If you are overweight or obese and have Type 2 diabetes and are 50 or older, you need to ask your primary-care doctor if you might have fatty-liver disease,” Loomba advises. For patients in midlife who have already piled on extra pounds, or are gaining a few pounds each year, even moderate weight loss can reduce risk and help reverse harm to the liver, he adds.

Andrew Jeong,11232017,MarketWatch,11162017,"Published: Nov 22, 2017 5:01 a.m. ET Video shows soldier’s dramatic escape across DMZ By SUWON, South Korea — North Korea violated the armistice that ended the Korean War when its border guards, while pursuing a soldier who was defecting to the South last week, crossed the line separating the two Koreas and fired across the frontier, a U.S.-led investigation found. The findings, together with video footage from the incident, were released Wednesday in Seoul by the United Nations Command, which signed the armistice ending hostilities in the Korean War in 1953, and which is overseen by Gen. Vincent Brooks, the top U.S. general on the Korean Peninsula. Chad Carroll, a spokesman for U.N. Command, said at a press briefing on Wednesday that it had notified North Korea of the armistice violations, and was requesting a meeting to discuss the incident. Brooks said that while the armistice agreement was “challenged” by the incident, “it remains in place” — essentially maintaining a status quo that has held for more than seven decades. The finding comes nine days after the soldier’s dramatic defection at the Joint Security Area, the most sensitive location on the heavily guarded inter-Korean border. North Korean guards shot at the soldier as he ran across the border into South Korea, hitting him at least five times and leaving him with life-threatening injuries.

Uber said Tuesday that it paid hackers $100,000 in an effort to conceal a data breach that affected 57 million accounts. In addition to the names, emails and phone numbers of riders, about 600,000 U.S. drivers’ license numbers were accessed, Uber said. Read: Were you affected by the massive hack of Uber?

It fired its chief security officer and a deputy for their role in the breach and covering it up, and Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi apologized.

Alessandra Malito,11232017,MarketWatch,11162017,"Published: Nov 23, 2017 8:52 a.m. ET ‘Eating clean’ might be healthy, but it’s also costly By Hosting Thanksgiving dinner this year? Prepare for more fussy guests. People are closely eyeing the proteins they consume. Sales for natural and organic turkeys grew 153% more during the three weeks leading up to Thanksgiving last year, with $26 million in sales during the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, according to market research group Nielsen. It’s part of a wider trend. More than half of Americans believed organic food was more nutritional, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center study, and 40% said some of the food they buy is organic. (Scientists, however, contest foods labeled organic in supermarkets aren’t necessarily healthier than non-organic labeled foods, but that intensive marketing has helped fuel this notion). Also see: Are superbugs lurking in your Thanksgiving turkey? Diners believe this organic fare is healthier, but it is also more expensive. Organic foods have higher production and post-harvest handling costs. They have to be separated and maintained separately from conventional foods and require more intensive marketing, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Take this basket of usually cheap staples: Conventional 85% lean beef is $4.99 per pound on AmazonFresh,

                                   compared to $8.55 per pound when organic. One bunch of bananas is $1.58, compared to $2.18 for a bunch of organic bananas. A dozen large, cage-free eggs sell for $2.91 on the site, compared to a dozen organic brown eggs for $6.19. The average cost of this year’s home-cooked Thanksgiving meal for 10 is $49.12, a 75-cent decrease from last year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Adjusting for inflation, the cost of dinner is $20.54, the lowest in five years. A 16-pound turkey will cost $22.38 this year, or $1.40 per pound, down 2 cents per pound on last year or 36 cents less for the entire turkey. Some New Yorkers, however, are spending $200 to $300 or more for their turkeys this year, depending on the type. Some are going for “heritage” breeds, which cost $11 per pound, or a free-range all natural turkey, for $6 per pound, The Wall Street Journal reported. Still, almost 40% of Americans are skipping meat proteins this year, likely to spill into Thanksgiving, according to a recent Nielsen survey of 1,163 respondents in April, instead opting for plant-based meals to “eat clean” and improve health and weight management. And that’s a departure from how things used to be. “The holidays are a time for indulgence and not necessarily thinking too hard about what you’re eating,” said Sarah Schmansky, director of fresh growth and strategy at Nielsen. “Now more and more consumers want to know what’s in these products.” More people are searching for healthier options, said David Portalatin, vice president and food industry analyst at research firm NPD Group. “It has less to do with Thanksgiving,” he said. “This is how we’re starting to eat differently overall so why should Thanksgiving be an exception?” See also: This is the U.S.’s best diet — for the 7th year running Of course, the turkey is still the star of the show for the majority of people on Thanksgiving. There may be signs of tofu and kale at the table, but conventional turkeys generated $479 million in sales during the three weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, followed by $195 million in sales for conventional hams and $94 million in conventional breakfast sausage. Clean eating may be coming to the forefront of families’ minds this holiday, “but it is such a small piece of the overall pie,” Schmansky said. “It is the turkeys that bring consumers into the store for their entire shopping trip.” Some upside: Amazon and Whole Foods intend to lower prices of organic items to make them “more affordable for everyone,” the companies said in August. Consumers can tell the type of food they’re eating with labels, such as stickers or notes on the packaging that indicate the food is “free from artificial ingredients” or certified USDA organic, according to Nielsen data.

That message runs through this year’s best books for the years ahead, with recommended pathways that actively engage mind, body, spirit or any combination thereof. “AgeProof: Living Longer Without Running Out of Money or Breaking a Hip”  By Jean Chatzky, Michael F. Roizen, M.D., and Ted Spiker; Grand Central Publishing In a style both chatty and accessible, financial journalist Jean Chatzky, physician-author Michael F. Roizen and co-author Ted Spiker explore strategies to maintain your health and boost your wealth. Regardless of your age, the authors emphasize the importance of regular medical and financial checkups to assess where you are and what you may need to change. They suggest metrics for your wallet and physical fitness; and rather than fear those numbers, the authors say, welcome a signal that it’s time to switch to a healthier lifestyle or make financial course corrections. They advise building personal and professional teams to help in good times and bad, and counsel how to make sure your home is both a secure investment and a safe environment. It is never too late to recover from setbacks, say the authors, who offer specific help for troubles ranging from post-divorce finances to addictions. “Just Move! A New Approach to Fitness After 50”  by James P. Owen; National Geographic By the time he turned 70, former Wall Street executive and admitted couch potato James P. Owen was suffering from severe lower back pain, two bum knees, a faulty rotator cuff and a shuffling walk that made him look like a “poster child for looming old age.” Rather than feel defeated, though, he set about getting fit. In this direct, practical and inspiring book, he shares his lessons. “Getting fit is nowhere near as hard as dealing with the infirmities of old age,” he writes. He urges readers to set realistic goals that focus on functional fitness: the mobility, strength, balance and flexibility to comfortably go about your daily life. He provides tips for starting a fitness routine that suits your needs and abilities, checklists for finding personal trainers, and clear instructions and illustrations for exercises that he suggests become core parts of your fitness program. “Four Seasons in a Day: Travel, Transitions and Letting Go of the Place We Call Home”  by Deborah L. Jacobs; DJWorking Unlimited Inc. Whether enticed by the lure of adventure, or the possibility and sometimes the necessity of lower-cost living, many couples on the cusp of retirement dream of living abroad. All of these motivations led financial journalist and lawyer Deborah L. Jacobs and her husband to rent out their Brooklyn townhouse to strangers for three months while they decamped to France to live in temporary digs leased from other strangers. Deftly combining travelogue with how-to practicalities, Jacobs chronicles each stage of their journey, starting with repairing and decluttering their own home to make it attractive to tenants. She walks readers through the nitty-gritty of websites for short-term stays, tips on vetting renters of your home, and how to evaluate advertisements for places you might wish to rent. She candidly describes how she learned the hard way, after booking a rental that looked ideal in the ad but turned out to be an alarmingly musty dud. Jacobs and her spouse found a quirky yet pleasing alternative, also through the internet. For Jacobs, the pleasures of food markets, out-of-the-way villages, enduring friendships and absorbing French customs outweighed all of the frustrations—even discovering the crayoned walls, furniture tears, and chips and cracks her tenants left behind in Brooklyn. This book is invaluable preparation for anyone thinking about long-term travel options. “National Parks of Europe”  Lonely Planet This sumptuously illustrated volume profiles 60 parks ranging from the bucolic to the rugged, including England’s Lake District, coastal Italy’s Cinque Terre, the French Pyrenees, Sicily’s Mount Etna and the Swiss Alps. Other destinations are lesser known but no less inviting: The Italian Dolomites sport monumental peaks, charming lakeside villages, rare flowers and trails that range from easy strolls to strenuous climbs. In Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales, the moors and hills are dotted with ancient stone circles, castle ruins and historic forts; there are caves ready to be explored, and trails for mountain-biking and hiking. Iceland’s Snaefellsjokull teems with fiords, sea cliffs, volcanic peaks, lava fields, glaciers and waterfalls; outdoor activities from bird- and seal-watching to horseback riding and hot-spring bathing are available, too.

To him, aging positively means allowing yourself to be affected by even the most melancholy losses. “You have to have reflected on life, including its downside, before you can start crafting a life that is subtle and wise,” he writes. By contrast, refusing to grapple with and reframe powerful emotions that arise as we grow older risks a brittle, one-dimensional view of life, either forcibly upbeat and sentimental, or curmudgeonly and sour. He includes lessons learned from his patients over a 40-year career, and cites a wide range of writers from ancient philosophers to psychologist Carl G. Jung as he leads readers through what he sees as five phases of aging: “feeling immortal; first taste of aging; settling into maturity; shifting toward old age; and letting things take their course.” Throughout, he calls on readers to discover, realize and act on their untapped resources for creativity, expression, building community and forging a meaningful legacy for future generations. “As you get older, if you’re not moving beyond your earlier understanding of life, you’re not expanding,” he writes. Though his tone will strike some as touchy-feely, Moore’s message is resonant. “Witness Tree: Seasons of Change with a Century-Old Oak”  By Lynda V. Mapes; Bloomsbury Forest trees reveal much about the passage of time, writes Seattle Times environmental reporter Lynda V. Mapes. The trick is to decode the stories in their roots, buds, leaves and ring cores, the tales told by the birds, bugs, mice and mushrooms who make their homes in the surrounding area. The red oak at the center of the book, part of the Harvard Forest of Massachusetts, is “a living timeline of cultural and economic change,” Mapes writes. It has survived storms, fires, birds nipping at its buds, insects attacking its bark, and tree-cutting humans in search of cordwood. The author makes a strong case for why the future depends on the health of the tree’s intricate ecological system and the larger environment of which it is part. She incorporates conversations with scientists and woodland specialists and ably weaves their research into her larger chronicle of change and adaptation. Diane Cole is a writer in New York City.

Amid simmering tensions over Goodell’s contract extension, Jones wrote that he believes the league’s compensation committee is receiving “valuable feedback from a number of owners” and is subsequently withdrawing his threatened legal action over approving the deal. After acknowledging “I know you are tired of hearing from me,” Jones said that he believes the commissioner’s performance “cannot be rewarded at this time.” “Our job is far from finished,” he said, adding that he is trying to prevent further damage beyond what has transpired since May, when the league’s owners unanimously approved an extension for Goodell. Jones cited declines in television ratings for NFL games, lower ticket sales and attendance, discontent among fans, and high-profile litigation over player suspensions, among other problems related to Goodell’s leadership. He also noted “inflated” league staff and budget in his Tuesday letter. In addition, he argued he isn’t “acting out in retaliation for my player’s suspension,” a reference to Goodell’s high-profile suspension of Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott.

Mark Kolakowski,11302017,Investopedia,11232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs While many observers consider Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to be an unstoppable force that steamrolls the competition wherever it goes, most notably in retail and cloud computing, the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are particularly important areas where it lags, Bloomberg reports. Getting up to speed is vital for Amazon, Bloomberg adds, because the running of AI applications is likely to fuel much of the future growth in cloud computing. Global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that sales of software for coding AI applications will increase by 40% through 2021, exceeding $8 billion, and that the growth will be even faster for these products in the cloud, Bloomberg says. Meanwhile, competitors Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), the parent of Google, have raced ahead in developing AI applications for their cloud computing clients, per Bloomberg. Back on its home turf of retailing, Amazon is facing serious pushback from brick-and-mortar rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which is investing heavily in technology. (For more, see also: Why Amazon's Biggest Threat May Be Wal-Mart.) Among the areas where Amazon falls short is the development of AI applications that will assist cloud computing clients in parsing data, understanding speech, and recognizing images, Bloomberg says. While Amazon remains the market leader in cloud computing, Bloomberg notes that Microsoft and Google are closing the gap partly by offering AI applications that are inducing clients to switch. (For more, see also: Microsoft Cloud Sales Show It's Catching Up With Amazon.) For internal use, on the other hand, Amazon has applied AI technology in its warehouse robots and in Amazon Go, a prototype for a store with any cashiers, Bloomberg indicates. Meanwhile, for the consumer market, Amazon has created a recent splash with its Echo speakers and Alexa voice control system, and the company has been using machine learning since the mid-1990s to make purchase recommendations. (For more, see also: Amazon vs. Wal-Mart: Who is Winning the Robot Wars?) Amazon is trying to plug the research gap between its rivals and itself by aggressive hiring of seasoned, respected experts in areas such as machine learning, computer vision and language, Bloomberg reports. About a year ago, Amazon rolled out several AI services for its cloud computing clients, per Bloomberg: Lex understands speech and text, Polly is used in creating apps that speak, and Rekognition describes pictures. Liberty Mutual Insurance used Lex to create a chatbot​ that answers employee questions on a variety of topics, Bloomberg says. Accounting software firm Intuit Inc. (INTU) is using Amazon's tools to answer customers' questions about taxes and to detect fraud. Polly is utilized by language learning app Duolingo and Rekognition is being applied in law enforcement to identify persons of interest, Bloomberg adds as examples. Amazon's cloud computing offering, Amazon Web Services (AWS), typically has given clients the lowest level of functionality. Called infrastructure as a service (IaaS), this gives clients access to computing power over the internet, but not much else. The clients are responsible for developing their own applications or buying the software from other vendors to run on Amazon's computers. Microsoft's Azure service, meanwhile, typically offers the next step up in functionality, platform as a service (PaaS). This combines raw computing power with some software, as well as tools to assist the clients' own software developers. The three Amazon AI applications discussed above, Lex, Polly and Rekognition, fall into this level. The highest level of cloud computing is software as a service (SaaS), which offers off-the-shelf applications software that clients run on the provider's computers. Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) is a premier SaaS provider.  ",How Amazon Is Losing The Artificial Intelligence Race | Investopedia

(For more, see also: Home Depot Has Another Strong Quarter.) This stock quickly reached an all-time high of $176.77 after Hudson upgraded the company, CNBC reported. On Wednesday, November 29, these shares rose even higher, climbing to as much as $178.06, according to Google Finance. Shares closed at $177.25 that day. If the company's stock does climb to $197, it will represent a roughly 11% increase from this last price. Shares of rival Lowe's Companies Inc.

In a research report covered by StreetInsider.com, Needham analyst Laura Martin maintained her buy rating, saying she upped the price target because of valuation, strategic position, active user growth and expanding average revenue per user (ARPU) and margins. “Like Netflix (NFLX), we view ROKU as a pure-play on over-the-top (OTT) TV-viewing growth, but ROKU has no content risk,” wrote the analyst. She noted that announcements from the likes of Disney (DIS), Alphabet’s (GOOG) Google and Amazon (AMZN) that they are launching new streaming services actually helps Roku but hurts Netflix. (See also: Roku Prices IPO at $14, Valuing It at $1.3B​.) At $50 a share, the analyst is implying the stock can gain an additional nearly 14%. Since it went public in September, shares of Roku are up nearly 70%. Recently Roku was trading at up 11.8% or $4.64 to $44.11. The way Needham sees it, Roku is the best comparison to Netflix for investors but comes at a much cheaper price. Earlier this month, the streaming content device maker offered up its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, easily beating Wall Street expectations for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. During the third quarter, Roku said it had $124.8 million in revenue, up from $89 million in the third quarter of last year. The net loss narrowed to $7.9 million from $12.7 million in the third quarter of 2016. Analysts had been looking for revenue of $110 million and losses of $12.7 million, reported Variety. A large portion of Roku’s uptick in revenue can be attributed to advertising and licenses, which Roku classifies under its platform revenue. Non-hardware sales were $57.5 million while its streaming players brought in $67.3 million of sales for the quarter, noted Variety. The platform business, jumped 137% year-over-year where hardware only saw a 4% increase. During a conference call to discuss third-quarter results, CEO Anthony Wood said advertising makes up two thirds of the platform revenue. (See also: Roku Set to Surpass Rivals in Web-Connected TV.) Looking out to next year, Needham also boosted its estimates thanks to a strong third-quarter user and ARPU growth and improving gross margins. Needham thinks Roku will break even on EBITDA in the third quarter, which is a quarter ahead of expectations. ",Roku: Needham Lifts Price Target as Stock Surges | Investopedia

Mark Kolakowski,11302017,Investopedia,11232017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The S&P 500 Index (SPX​) should reach a record 2,800 by the end of 2018, more than 7.5% above the open of trading on Monday, based on the average forecasts from nine market strategists polled by Bloomberg. Some strategists forecast stocks could rise as much as 27 percent. Those gains would create the longest bull market on record. Key reasons for their continued bullishness, per Bloomberg: even without tax reform, corporate earnings in the U.S. are rising at a double-digit pace, and the global economy is showing its most consistent growth in more than a decade. Most of these strategists did not put assumptions about tax reform into their forecasts, Bloomberg notes. The most bullish tax reform scenario is offered by strategist Keith Parker of Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG. Parker has a base case of 2,900 for the S&P 500 in 2018, up 11.5% from today's opening, but he projects that the index could reach 3,300, up 26.8%, if corporate tax cuts take effect in 2018, Bloomberg says. In the capitalization-weighted S&P 500, the five so-called FAAMG​ technology stocks currently account for about 13.8% of the index's value, according to SlickCharts.com, and thus are key drivers of the S&P's gains. These stocks are, in order of weight from highest to lowest, and with their year-to-date gains through November 24: Apple Inc. (AAPL), +53%; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), +37%; Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL and GOOG), +35%; Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), +58%; and Facebook Inc. (FB) +59%. The S&P 500 rose 16.2% over the same year-to-date period. While the five soaring FAAMG stocks have had an outsized influence on the S&P 500, there nonetheless are indicators that the 2017 rally has been broad-based. Chris Verrone, head of technical analysis at Strategas Research Partners, calculated early last week that more than 70% of the S&P 500 stocks have posted gains, and that the spread between the cap-weighted S&P 500 and an equal-weighted version is not excessive. (For more, see also: Why the 'Santa Claus"" Stock Rally Is at Risk.) Meanwhile, the stock market's advance has been a global phenomenon. Among 35 indexes that track the stock markets with the biggest capitalizations around the world, at least half have set new all-time records in 2017, per analysis by The Wall Street Journal. This is the best showing in this respect since 2007, the Journal adds. While leading indexes in Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan have not reached new all-time highs in 2017, they nonetheless have exceeded values last seen years ago, respectively in 1996, 2007 and 1990, per the Journal. (For more, see also: Global 4% GDP Growth Can Fuel Stocks in 2018: Goldman.) Investors should note that market strategists have a long history of bullish bias. Since 1999, U.S. market strategists tracked by Bloomberg never have predicted a stock market decline for the upcoming year, instead calling for an average annual gain of 9% during this period. A particularly notorious case was 2008, when the S&P 500 plummeted 39%. The consensus forecast had called for an 11% gain. On the other hand, even the most bullish strategists polled in January were not predicting a 16% advance for the S&P 500 this year, Bloomberg adds. In fact, the current bull market has outrun strategists' expectations by about 3.8 percentage points per year since it started in March 2009, Bloomberg says.

It's now been just over two years since Google restructured as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), in an effort to simultaneously ensure autonomy for its moon-shot bets while also providing investors with greater transparency into how those bets are going. Of all the subsidiaries that were placed into the ""Other Bets"" category, Nest was among the more meaningful. Google acquired Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion, which was among the main revenue generators within Other Bets. Nest Cam IQ Outdoor. Image source: Getty Images. The speculation comes as Google's hardware ambitions have reached unprecedented levels. The search giant now creates more first-party hardware than ever before, and that's not going to stop anytime soon. In particular, the hardware event in October featured a growing portfolio of smart-home devices, adding the $49 Google Home Mini and $349 Google Home Max to the mix. Yet Nest continues to expand its own portfolio of smart-home products, announcing no less than six new products in September, including a smart doorbell (Nest Hello), indoor and outdoor security cameras (Nest Cam IQ), and even a home security system (Nest Secure), among others. Nest Secure. Image source: Nest. As Google's smart-home products and Nest products are seeing increasing overlap in their portfolios, it makes perfect sense to reintegrate Nest so that the teams can collaborate better in areas like product development and marketing. Google Home devices already work with Nest products to some degree, but the company could really take it to the next level by merging the teams. Marketing teams from both Nest and Google are often communicating with the same retailers to distribute products, according to the report. Nest now has approximately 1,000 employees, which would be a strong addition. Google announced in September that it was acqui-hiring HTC's Pixel team for $1.1 billion, which will add about 2,000 employees to the search giant's hardware team. Google's hardware team is expanding in lockstep with its growing aspirations to make first-party hardware to better compete with Amazon.com's market-leading Echo portfolio. It's less clear how Google would approach marketing and branding. Nest already enjoys a reasonably strong brand in smart-home technology, while Google's devices all share the Google Home brand. There could be an opportunity to consolidate the branding under one product family, although it's not like disjointed branding has ever bothered Google that much (the company has nearly a dozen apps and services related to messaging and communication). Consider how Alphabet CEO Larry Page opened his letter to shareholders when announcing the Alphabet restructuring (emphasis added): As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, ""Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one."" As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make ""smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses."" From the start, we've always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. While most of these ""smaller bets"" have been now placed into the ""Other Bets"" segment in line with this sentiment, Nest is becoming a fairly large bet on an area that does not seem ""very speculative or even strange"" anymore. Smart-home technology is an important trend that all of the tech giants are exploring, and will prove to be a core aspect of their respective ecosystems. Nest should be a part of Google (again).

"Matthew Frankel, CFP, Rich Smith, and Keith Speights",11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Matt Frankel (BofI Holding): Over the past few years, online-only bank BofI Holding (BofI stands for ""Bank of Internet"") has grown impressively. In the past five years, the bank's assets have increased by 256%, its net interest income has grown by 264%, and EPS have improved by 213%, just to name some of the most impressive metrics. And while I don't think the bank will quite get to Alphabet's size anytime soon, the online-only banking business is about as mature as internet search was in 2004. Image source: Getty Images. There are several good reasons to believe in the bank's long-term potential. First of all, despite its growth, BofI is still a small bank. With $8.5 billion in total assets at the end of fiscal year 2017, BofI isn't even in the top 100 nationwide. Second, the bank has tremendous cost advantages over its brick-and-mortar peers. Its overall non-interest expense is 1.44% of its assets annually, less than half of its peer group average. BofI's returns on equity and assets are both more than twice the industry benchmarks. To sum up, BofI has cost advantages over its competitors and has barely tapped into its growth potential, the combination of which could translate into big profits down the road. Rich Smith (Roku): When Google had its IPO in 2004, many investors  derided the stock as ""overhyped and overvalued,"" even though Google was already No. 1 in its chosen marketplace of internet search. Does that sound like any other recent IPOs you know? It does to me. It sounds a lot like Roku. Like Google in 2004, Roku is a recent IPO, having come public just two months ago. Like Google, it's market value is questionable. Since its IPO at $14 per share on Sept. 28 , Roku has doubled in price, lost 30% of that double, and then gained it all back again. At last report, Roku's stock was spotted shooting past $46 in value -- more than triple its IPO price. Yet with no profits to its name, and just $436 million in trailing revenues, the stock's $4.6 billion market capitalization exceeds 10 times sales and seems to fit the definition of ""overvalued"" to a ""T."" Yet just like Google in 2004, Roku dominates its market. According to market researcher Parks Associates , Roku boasts a 37% market share in ""over the top"" streaming devices. Amazon's Fire TV, Apple TV -- even Google's own Chromecast -- don't even come close. Will Roku maintain its lead in the years to come? Can it translate wild consumer popularity into cold, hard cash profits? That remains to be seen. But if Google's performance offers any example, I'd say Roku's chances look good. Keith Speights (Intuitive Surgical): Alphabet is such a monster now that it's easy to forget where it was back in 2004. At that time, Google's market cap hovered around $50 billion. The company's trailing-12-month revenue stood just under $3 billion. But Google clearly dominated its market as the leading search engine. I think robotic surgical systems maker Intuitive Surgical looks a lot like the Google of 13 years ago. Intuitive Surgical's market cap currently stands at around $45 billion, not too far below where Google was in 2004. The company made nearly $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. And Intuitive Surgical is the hands-down leader in the robotic surgical systems market. I think the similarities between the two companies go beyond just numbers, though. Like Google in 2004, Intuitive Surgical should be in store for tremendous growth ahead. There's an unstoppable trend that I believe will drive demand for the company's surgical robots much higher in the years to come: aging populations. As individuals in the U.S. and across the world age, they're more likely to need the types of surgeries for which da Vinci is most used. In 2004, Google didn't face the competitive threat that it did just a few years later when Microsoft launched Bing. Intuitive Surgical is likewise something of a monopoly now, but faces stiffer competition over the next few years. Still, I think the stock is poised to follow a similar path as Google did -- an upward one. ","
      
    3 Stocks That Look Just Like Google in 2004 -- The Motley Fool

John Rosevear,11302017,Fool,11232017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. When should car buyers -- and investors -- expect driverless vehicles to be available to the public? It's a question I get asked all the time. That's no surprise: Self-driving vehicles are likely to be a transformative technology, and we Fools love to get in on those early on. But it turns out that the answer to the question depends on what you mean by ""driverless"" -- and by ""available."" Waymo, the company formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, is a leader in the driverless-car race. But it's not yet clear how Waymo will bring its technology to market. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. First, let's define some terms. ""Driverless,"" ""autonomous,"" and ""self-driving"" all mean pretty much the same thing: a vehicle that can drive itself with no human intervention required, at least under some circumstances. There's nothing like that on the market quite yet. While systems like Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Autopilot and General Motors' (NYSE:GM) Super Cruise do allow hands-free driving under limited circumstances, both require the presence of a human driver who is at least somewhat alert and ready to take over the task of driving on short notice. SAE International, the professional association of automotive engineers, defines vehicle automation in six steps, from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation). You can learn more about the ""levels"" here, but for our purposes, Levels 4 and 5 are the ones that are effectively ""self-driving."" What's the difference? Level 4 is full self-driving within certain limits: Most of the self-driving systems likely to come to market in the near future are dependent on highly detailed 3-D maps; if you want to go somewhere that isn't on the car's map, you'll have to drive yourself. There may be other limits as well: A Level 4 system might not work in the snow, for instance. Snow and ice present big challenges to driverless-vehicle systems. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Level 5 is a system that can drive anywhere a human driver could. The driverless-car systems likely to come to market in the near future are Level 4, limited to mapped areas. As the maps expand over time, those vehicles will come closer and closer to Level 5. But most experts think a full-blown Level 5 system is at least several years away. To sum up: For at least the next several years, driverless vehicles will be ""geofenced,"" limited to areas that have been carefully mapped. They may also be limited by weather and other conditions. But Level 4 vehicles are coming soon. To understand how soon, let's look at how they're likely to come to market. There are a number of efforts underway to bring a Level 4 system to market in the near future. Among the most prominent: A Level 4 driverless version of GM's Chevrolet Bolt EV may become the first mass-produced driverless car, within two years. Image source: General Motors. Several U.S. cities have already been well mapped, including Pittsburgh (home of Uber's own self-driving technology program) and San Francisco, home of GM's self-driving subsidiary Cruise Automation. GM said recently that it is currently working to map New York City and other mapping efforts are under way around the country. When will that start to happen? GM expects to have Level 4 vehicles operating in ride-hailing service in dense urban areas at scale by 2019. Waymo may be thinking along similar lines: It recently took a big step in that general direction, announcing that some of its test vehicles operating in Arizona will soon begin testing without a human driver standing by at the wheel. So when will we be able to buy one? That may turn out to be a question for regulators, and the answer may depend on how well the first Level 4 vehicles perform in ride-hailing service. If they have a lot of problems, it'll take longer. It may also depend on the public's reaction: How many people will want the technology on their privately owned vehicles, and how much will they be willing to pay for it? (Of course, a few companies -- I'm thinking of Tesla here -- might not wait to find out what regulators or the public think.) ","

Whether they're looking for drones, smart home products, wearable tech, or a myriad of other gifts, this list is sure to have something to make them smile. Image source: Google. Let's start with something small yet packed with tech wizardry: the new Google Home Max smart speaker. This is the high-end version of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home speaker. Not only can it answer nearly any question you throw at it, but it knows how to drop the beat. Google Home Max comes with Google Assistant, the voice-enabled virtual assistant that can answer questions, control other smart home devices (like a Nest thermostat or adjustable lights), change the speaker's volume, tell you a joke, play song requests, and much more -- all through simple voice commands. It's easy enough for anyone to use, but for a tech-savvy person who uses a lot of apps and has a few smart home devices, the possibilities are endless. The Home Max will sell for $399 and will come with 12 months of ad-free YouTube Music. It's not available just yet, but you can join a waitlist to be notified as soon as it's for sale. Image source: Apple. Sure, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartwatch has been out for a few years now, but the new Series 3 adds cellular connectivity for the first time -- something technophiles have been wanting from the Apple Watch for a while. The cellular connection allows you to make calls, stream music, and use Siri to send text messages without tethering the Watch to an iPhone. The Watch is also water-resistant to 50 meters and comes with an array of motion sensors, an ultra-fast Apple W2 processor, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, GPS, and an 18-hour battery life. The 38 mm Watch with GPS and cellular starts at $399, while the 42 mm version starts at $429. Image source: DJI. Drones are all the rage these days, and the new DJI Mavic Pro Platinum is one of the best portable drones on the market. The Mavic Pro Platinum is foldable, making it perfect for traveling. It has a 12 megapixel camera that records video in ultra-high-definition 4K. The remote control has a range of up to 4.3 miles, and the battery will last for up to 30 minutes of flight -- that is, if it's not in ""sport mode,"" where it can reach speeds of 40 miles per hour. The Mavic Pro Platinum also comes with the DJI's FlightAutonomy technology, which allows the drone to see obstacles up to 49 feet away and avoid them autonomously. All of these features and more are packed into a drone that measures 13 inches across (when not folded) and weighs 1.6 pounds. Of course, drones of this caliber don't come cheap, and this particular model costs about $1,099. That makes the Mavic Pro Platinum a good gift for a dear loved one who is both tech-savvy and adventurous enough to appreciate its impressive capabilities. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) says its new Xbox One X is the most powerful gaming console ever made, and the device has the specs to back that claim up. The console has 4K Ultra HD video graphics and high dynamic range (HDR) technology for superior colors, which means you can play games and stream movies or TV shows with some of the highest video resolutions and color ranges available today. You can also play Ultra HD Blu-Ray discs on the console, but keep in mind that you need a 4K TV to get the full experience. The Xbox One X is a huge leap forward from its predecessor, with a new eight-core AMD processor, double the memory, and a far more powerful graphics processor. An optional headset enables you to give voice commands to Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant, which can open games, scroll through menus, and play back video, and more. Expect to shell out about $500 for the Xbox One X right now. Image source: Apple. Apple's newest iPhone has garnered lots of attention for its $999 base price tag, but the cost comes with some remarkable features. First is the edge-to-edge, 5.8-inch OLED display. Pushing the screen out to all of the iPhone's edges is a first for Apple, and it allowed the company to expand the screen without making the phone itself much bigger. The iPhone X's second killer feature is its FaceID facial recognition. You can unlock the device just by looking at it, and third-party developers are already creating new apps to take advantage of the technology. The newest iPhone comes packed with Apple's new A11 processor, which delivers better-than-ever speed, graphics, and computing power. Its 12 megapixel camera has both a wide-angle and telephoto lens (with portrait mode), as well as the ability to shoot video in 4K. The iPhone X is pricey, but all of these features back up its hefty price tag. Image source: Apple. If you're looking for a great pair of high-tech wireless earphones, but you don't want to bust your holiday budget, then the $99 BeatsX earphones are a great bet. The BeatsX comes packed with Apple's W1 chip -- the same one found in Apple's more expensive AirPods -- which allows the BeatsX to pair with an iPhone much faster than it would through a Bluetooth connection (though Bluetooth is still available if you don't have an iPhone). The chip also helps improve battery life: The BeatsX can last for eight hours of continual use, and a five-minute charge will get you two hours of playback. These earphones received solid reviews from both The Verge and CNET this year, and testers have praised its sound quality, comfort, design, and value. The neckband style (it has a wire that connects the two earphones together) may not be for everyone, but the device's internal specs are sure to please any tech-savvy person on your list. Image source: Nintendo. There's already a gaming console on this list, but the Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY)Switch deserves to be here just as much as the Xbox One X. No, the Switch doesn't have high-end 4K video resolution, but what it lacks in visuals it makes up for in portability. That's because the Switch is designed to transform from a home gaming console to a handheld device in just seconds. It's essentially a 6.2-inch tablet that has detachable controllers that slide onto either side of the Switch when you're on the go. When you get back home, the tablet slides into a docking station and switches (get it?) into a full-fledged HD gaming system. The Switch costs $300, which is a great deal for such a versatile gaming system. Image source: Roku. Finally, if you're looking for an inexpensive way to give your friend's TV a huge tech upgrade, then you should take look at Roku's (NASDAQ:ROKU) $70 Streaming Stick+. The device is small enough to take on trips, it streams video content in 4K, and it's compatible with HDR images for superior color quality. The great thing about Roku's streaming device is that you get access to the usual content suspects -- Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, etc. -- but you can also tap into thousands of other streaming apps as well. Roku's Streaming Stick+ comes with a quad-core processor, it discreetly plugs into the back of your TV, and the voice-enabled remote allows you to search for shows just by talking to it. You can also control the power and volume on your TV right from the Roku remote (no more searching for separate remotes!). If all of that isn't enticing enough, Roku is taking $20 off of the Streaming Stick+ price during the Black Friday weekend. ","

The world is becoming more connected every day. One area where this can be seen is the trend toward smart homes. A growing number of internet-connected devices are allowing homeowners to control key systems -- such as lighting, heating, air conditioning, and security -- remotely by a phone or computer. In the midst of this growth, the major tech titans are battling to become the core platform upon which these smart home systems are built. Read on to learn more about the three leaders of this emerging battleground. Google Home. Image source: Google. When Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google paid $3.2 billion to acquire high-tech thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014, it was widely believed to signal an aggressive new push by Google into the burgeoning smart-home market. Yet several years later, Nest hasn't quite turned out to be the Trojan horse into people's homes that Google may have hoped. In fact, Reuters recently reported that Alphabet tried to sell Nest in 2016 but was unable to complete a deal. Nevertheless, Google continues to expand its beachhead in the smart-home market. The company launched its Google Home  product in late 2016. The smart-speaker hub is powered by Google Assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to answer users' questions and voice commands. Google's offerings have drawn strong early reviews. Notably, a recent test by digital brand agency 360i showed that Google Home is six times as likely to answer a user's question than Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa. This is perhaps to be expected, as Google's technology has been strengthened by its nearly two decades of search experience and data collection. Google's expertise in these areas makes it a legitimate threat to Amazon, the current leader in the smart-speaker market. Amazon's Echo and Echo Dot smart speakers. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon commands a 70% share of the voice-enabled speaker-device market, according to eMarketer. Its Echo smart-speaker device had a nearly two-year head start on Google Home, and it used that time to build a sizable installed base of more than 15 million units sold, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Echo is powered by Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which integrates with more than 20,000 ""skills,"" or voice-based apps. Amazon has also formed a host of partnerships with third-party smart-home device makers as well as retailers such as Kohl's to help boost distribution. Amazon's smart-home products benefit from their prominent placement on Amazon.com, the most popular online retail site in the United States. They certainly seem to be deserving of such promotion; Alexa-enabled devices were the top-selling products across all categories on Amazon this past holiday season, with Echo sales surging more than 800% year over year. With its commanding lead in the smart-home race, Amazon will be hard to beat. Apple HomePod. Image source: Apple. Another competitor not to be taken lightly in the smart-home arena is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple is attempting to counter Amazon and Google's speaker-centered smart-home strategies with its new HomePod device. HomePod will feature Siri -- Apple's popular virtual assistant -- which should help it integrate well with the vast ecosystem of Macs and iOS devices already in use around the world. HomePod will also prominently highlight Apple Music, which offers access to 40 million songs, compared with only 2 million for Amazon's Prime Music. In fact, a major portion of Apple's competitive strategy rests on the superior quality of HomePod's speakers compared with that of Google Home and Amazon's Echo devices, as well as its spatial-awareness technology, which can identify where it is in a room and tailor the way it plays music to fit that particular space. Apple is also hoping to that HomePod's user privacy aspects will help to further differentiate it from the competition. Unlike Amazon and Google, which plan to harvest user data from their products, Apple will use anonymous ID security so users' searches aren't tracked back to them. As privacy concerns rise, this could be an important advantage for Apple. And Apple will need these advantages, as it is pricing HomePod at $349 -- significantly above the Echo's $179.99 and Google Home's $129. This high-quality premium strategy has worked many times before for Apple, but it remains to be seen whether it will work in the smart-home speaker market. Still, Apple has shown -- first with the iPhone and later with the iPad -- that it doesn't have to be the first to enter a market to dominate it. While it will need to battle what are perhaps the two fiercest competitors it has ever locked horns with in Alphabet and Amazon, it's conceivable that the smart-home market could ultimately become another in a long line of Apple conquests. All told, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple are likely to rule the voice-controlled speaker market. And with these devices looking as if they will be the central hub of many connected-home systems, those wanting to invest in smart-home stocks may wish to consider these three tech titans. ","

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) legal battle with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shows no signs of de-escalating, despite Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf's hopes over the summer that the two companies could settle. Quite the opposite, in fact: The Mac maker has now filed a countersuit against the mobile chip giant alleging that it is infringing on at least eight patents related to battery life. The patents relate to a smartphone processor's power consumption, and how the processor tries to consume just enough juice necessary, in order to prolong battery life, as well as deactivating different components within the processor when not needed, according to Reuters. Image source: Getty Images. The specific processors in question are Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 and 820 processors. The Snapdragon 800 is found inside older flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, while the newer Snapdragon 820 powers the Galaxy S7 from last year. The chips are not Qualcomm's latest and greatest, but are still prevalent in many midrange phones that were high-end flagships a year or two ago. The countersuit is in response to Qualcomm's patent infringement suit filed in July related to six of its own patents, some of which also had to do with battery life. Apple had initially denied infringement and expectedly argued that Qualcomm's patents were invalid, but did not countersue at the time. Qualcomm had also filed an injunction request with the International Trade Commission based on the infringement allegations, seeking an import ban, but was only looking to block the import of iPhones carrying Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) modems. That didn't sit right with Intel, since none of the patents were related to cellular technology, so it looked an awful lot like Qualcomm was trying to use unrelated patents to preclude a baseband modem competitor. Intel called out Qualcomm in its Public Interest Statement in July (emphasis original): Apple is reportedly seeking unspecified damages, but oftentimes these types of suits are meant to increase the legal pressure and incentive to settle. Too bad that doesn't look like it's going to happen anytime soon, and Apple appears to be accelerating its shift toward Intel modems.

Voice-activated digital assistants have become one of the more pervasive technologies in the world, found on nearly every smartphone, with Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri being one of the most well-known. Once restricted to phones, these virtual helpers can now be found on a wide variety of devices. Smart speakers like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Home top the list. The technology is present in many home computers via Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cortana, and in an increasing number of cars, like the Audi (NASDAQOTH:AUDVF) Q3 with voice commands. But hackers are hard at work trying to gain the upper hand in any computer technology, and voice control is high on their hit list. Hackers can now hijack voice-controlled devices. Image source: Getty Images. While many methods employed by hackers require a user to make some error in judgement, like clicking a malicious link in a seemingly legitimate email, these latest attacks can be accomplished without any misstep from the user. Researchers from China's Zhejiang University have reportedly discovered a way to hijack the most widely used voice-controlled devices using ultrasonic frequencies that are inaudible to human hearing, but can be detected by the microphones on your smartphone and other devices. Deploying a technique they called a ""DolphinAttack,"" the team translated some of the most-used human voice commands into high frequencies -- above 20 kHz -- and then aimed them at smartphones, tablets, smart speakers, and even some in-car interfaces. In their recently published study, the researchers tested voice control agents from some of the biggest names in technology, testing 16 in all. Siri, Google Now, and Amazon's Alexa were all subjected to the experiment, as were Cortana, Audi voice command, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) S Voice. The research team was able to use basic commands like ""Hey, Siri"" and ""Alexa"" to activate the devices, as well as successfully instructing iPhones to ""call 1234567890"" and an iPad to FaceTime the same number. They were able to convince Google Now to switch to airplane mode, and even successful at controlling the navigation system on the Audi. The hack was effective across every device tested, in a variety of languages. The attacks were accomplished using a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge smartphone, an ultrasonic transducer, a low-cost amplifier, and a battery. Excluding the smartphone, the cost of the parts necessary to build the hacking tool was less than $3. There are certain limitations that currently restrict the effectiveness of the hijack. The hacking tool had a range of only five or six feet. Also, it was necessary for a user's device to be activated in order for the hacker's commands to be accepted, which is more likely with smart speakers than cellphones. The commands had limited effectiveness in noisy environments. And because digital assistants provide audible responses to voice requests, it's unlikely that these attacks would pass unnoticed. Still, this research serves as a cautionary tale. Advances in technology come with limitations and new sets of vulnerabilities all their own. ","

Sure, we're still years away from seeing autonomous vehicles on a daily basis, but Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH) are making their moves now -- and investors should pay attention. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. This one may seem like a no-brainer, although of course there are other automakers (even 100-year-old ones) that are doing a lot in the semi-autonomous space. But Tesla is a standout here because it continues to push the boundaries of driverless capabilities, and has car technology that I think will continue to serve the company well for years to come. For example, Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot feature is capable of driving the company's vehicles on the highway (maintaining speeds and distance from other vehicles, overtaking cars, making lane changes, and staying in its own lane). That isn't all that different from what other automakers are doing in some of their new vehicles, but Tesla is far more comprehensive in its autonomous approach. Tesla has even talked about how its customers will be able to rent out their autonomous Tesla cars when the vehicles aren't being used. CEO Elon Musk has said the company will perform a real-world coast-to-coast test of its fully autonomous system before the end of the year, which could help prove that its vehicles are indeed getting closer to full autonomy. But even if that demonstration gets delayed, as Tesla deadlines sometimes do, don't take it as a setback. The company's Autopilot feature and its decision to put fully autonomous hardware in all Tesla vehicles mean it is well on its way to an autonomous-car future. Tesla's stock isn't without its faults, of course. The company's shares aren't cheap, and Tesla is still trying to nail down the manufacturing process for its new Model 3 so it can improve its delivery schedule. But remember that Tesla is still a young company compared to its peers, and it's more than proven itself as a capable competitor. Image source: Tesla. I know that Intel may not be the most obvious choice for an autonomous-car stock right now, but hear me out on this one. Just a few months ago, Intel revealed that its processors are powering the driverless-car technology inside Alphabet's Waymo vehicles. You may remember that Waymo is the newly created company that used to be known as Google's Driverless Car Project. Waymo currently has 600 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road right now; some of them are even being used in public tests in Phoenix. Intel's chips process the information from the sensors in those vehicles, and compute all their self-driving tasks; they are used in wireless-connectivity features as well. That's a big deal for Intel because rival NVIDIA grabs most of the headlines about autonomous-vehicle chips these days, and, more importantly, because Waymo has some of the most advanced driverless-car tech on the road. But that's not the extent of Intel's autonomous car opportunities. Intel paid $15 billion earlier this year to acquire a company specializing in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), Mobileye. ADAS are the features in new vehicles that allow them to automatically brake in an emergency and to stay in their lanes when on the highway, and Mobileye holds 60% of that market right now. With that one purchase, Intel quickly became a key player in semi-autonomous driving. Even with its share-price gains over the past year (shares are up more than 25%), Intel's shares still look relatively cheap at just 13.7 times the company's forward earnings. Intel has already proven that its chips can be the backbone of autonomous-vehicle technology through its Alphabet partnership, and its purchase of Mobileye should help solidify Intel in this space for years to come. Last, but not least, is the giant automotive supplier Delphi. This company is the midst of some huge changes, revolving largely around driverless-car technologies. Just two years ago the company made an acquisition that gave it access to some much-needed driverless-car software. It was a solid acquisition at the time, and it helped the company make the announcement that it will release a Level 4 autonomous-driving system by 2022, in partnership with Mobileye. That was an important step in and of itself. But the company took its autonomous-driving software ambitions one step further last month, when it announced that it was buying start-up nuTonomy for $450 million. The start-up specializes in artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, which will add a layer of sophistication to Delphi's current software. All of this means that Delphi will soon be able to sell one of the most advanced autonomous-car software solutions to automakers. That's important, because any automaker looking for semi-autonomous and autonomous capabilities for its vehicles over the next few years could just order what it needs from Delphi, instead of building its own. Investors should also know that early next year, Delphi's autonomous-driving technology will be spun off into a new company called Aptiv (expected to trade under the ticker APTV). If you're just getting started investing in driverless cars, these three companies are a great place to start. Each is poised to dominate autonomous vehicles in a very different way, but all should see much more growth as the driverless-car market takes shape. ","

What are America's top-selling trucks so far in 2017? All five of the trucks on our list have something big in common: They're highly profitable for their makers. Not only do all of these trucks sell in huge numbers, but they're selling at higher prices than they did not long ago. Automakers with popular truck models have realized that many buyers will pay extra for premium comfort and convenience features more traditionally associated with luxury cars. That has driven average transaction prices to all-time highs -- and for some of these automakers, boosted profit margins significantly. That makes them important to investors as well as to car buyers. Here's a look at the five pickups that are bringing home extra bacon for their makers in 2017. While the big-selling Detroit pickups are popular with commercial buyers, Toyota has carved out a profitable niche for the midsize Tacoma as a fun ""lifestyle"" truck. Image source: Toyota. Across the industry, full-size pickups outsell midsize models, but Toyota (NYSE:TM) has always gone its own way. The latest Tacoma, introduced as a 2016 model, has been a big seller, with U.S. sales outpacing those of its larger Tundra sibling by about 1.7 to 1 this year. Through October, Toyota has sold 163,224 Tacomas in the U.S. in 2017, up 2.9% from a year ago. The GMC Sierra starts at just over $28,000, but loaded heavy-duty versions like this 2500 Denali HD can hit $70,000. There's a lot of profit for GM in there. Image source: General Motors. But despite the popularity of luxury trucks, the Sierra is getting a bit long in the tooth and sales are down in 2017. (An all-new Sierra is expected next year.) Through October, GM has sold 173,371 Sierras in the U.S. this year, down 3.4% from the same period in 2016. Like the GM twins, FCA's Ram is still selling well, but it's nearly ready for an overhaul. A new version arrives next spring. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Along with the super-profitable Jeep SUV brand, sales of the Ram pickup are a major driver of global profits for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU). The current version of the truck formerly known as the Dodge Ram (FCA made Ram a stand-alone brand in 2011) gets good reviews for its on-road comfort without skimping on the brawny capabilities that full-size truck buyers expect. FCA is expected to launch an all-new Ram next spring, but buyers are still turning out for the current model. Year to date through October, Ram sales have risen 3% from a year ago, to 419,102. The current Chevy Silverado is still selling well, but GM has had to increase incentives this year. A new Silverado is expected next fall. Image source: General Motors. The Chevy Silverado is GM's full-size stalwart, a big seller that generates a ton of profit for the General -- but it has been a little bit of a tough sell in 2017, and GM has had to boost its discounts to keep the trucks moving. That might seem like a surprise, as the Silverado isn't really that old -- it was introduced in 2013 as a 2014 model. But the truck market moves quickly, and despite a facelift for 2016, there's a perception that the big Chevy has fallen a step behind its bigger-selling archrival. That may change soon, as GM is known to be putting the finishing touches on the next-generation Silverado, expected to show up at dealers next fall. Year to date through October, GM has sold 471,747 Silverados in the U.S., down 0.8% from a year ago. Ford's F-150 was completely all-new for 2015, but Ford isn't standing still: 2018 models have revamped styling and a long list of updates. Image source: Ford Motor Company. What's new now? The Super Duty variants (F-250 and up) were all-new and hugely improved for 2017, and sales -- and prices -- have been very, very strong. The big-selling F-150, which was new for 2015, got a major update for 2018 -- and Ford has added an ultra-plush Limited trim to both the F-150 and the Super Duty models. The upshot? Through October, Ford has sold a hearty 734,610 F-Series pickups in the U.S., up 11.1% from the same period in 2016. ","

To borrow and modify a catchphrase from sports commentator Dan Patrick: ""You can't stop cryptocurrencies, you can only hope to contain them."" Last year, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies combined surged from $17.7 billion to $613 billion by years end. In just 12 months' time, the value of all virtual currencies rose by more than 3,300%! Mind you, the stock market, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, has historically gained about 7% per year. Digital currencies have absolutely left traditional assets in their dust. Leading the charge is bitcoin, which barreled briefly to $20,000 per coin in December. Bitcoin began 2017 below $970 a coin, so it's had an incredible run. Its current market cap of $117 billion actually places it ahead of Dow Jones Industrial Average stalwart General Electric. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin isn't alone. In fact, CoinMarketCap.com lists 1,560 different investable virtual currencies as of April 7, 2018 -- many of which have their very own underlying blockchain. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that records transactions without the need for a financial intermediary like a bank or credit union. With a low barrier to entry -- i.e., anyone with time, knowledge, and funding can create blockchain -- competition among virtual currencies and their blockchains can be fierce. The biggest competitor to bitcoin and its crypto-empire might appear to be Ethereum. Ethereum has the second-largest market cap of any digital currency, and it had an even better performance last year than bitcoin. Further, its blockchain is being tested in small-scale and pilot projects by more than 200 different organizations in the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. But the two cryptocurrency giants seemingly have different missions at the moment. Ethereum appears intent on pushing its blockchain to enterprises, while somewhat ignoring its Ether token as a means of payment. Meanwhile, bitcoin has focused extensively on building up its reputation as a payment facilitator, and only recently turned its attention to attracting businesses to its blockchain. While competitive to a degree, bitcoin and Ethereum aren't direct threats to one another. Image source: Getty Images. Instead, bitcoin's biggest competitor just might be Litecoin. As of April 7, 2018, Litecoin had the fifth-largest market cap of all cryptocurrencies, at $6.6 billion, trailing only, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and bitcoin. In many ways, bitcoin and Litecoin are extremely similar. They both have protocols written that limit the number of coins that can be mined, albeit the mean block time for Litecoin is quicker than bitcoin. This leads to potentially quicker payments, although smaller in most instances. They're also much older than most virtual currencies, with bitcoin and Litecoin being created in 2009 and 2011, respectively.  They are ""mature"" digital currencies, if such a thing exists. But what really ties these two at the hip and makes them competitors is their foremost focus on becoming go-to payment facilitators. Five brand-name companies have been accepting bitcoin as legal tender since 2014, with many smaller merchants joining in. Litecoin hasn't been nearly as successful, but that looks to be more a function of its creator, Charlie Lee, taking a backseat for years and only recently putting his full effort behind building up his cryptocurrency's use. Retailer Overstock.com is the one brand-name retailer that Litecoin has managed to attract. However, at the Litecoin Foundation website, there's a list of dozens of accepted retailers. Litecoin certainly has what it takes to give bitcoin a run for its (virtual) money. Last year, Litecoin completed the highly anticipated SegWit upgrade, which has been critical in improving the capacity of its blockchain, hastening settlement times, and reducing the costs to process transactions. Doing so should help attract businesses and, perhaps, investors. Then again, Charlie Lee doesn't view Litecoin as bitcoin's biggest rival. He believes that bitcoin and Litecoin can coexist for the betterment of both virtual currencies, although that remains to be seen. Image source: Getty Images. But one risk that bitcoin, Litecoin, and every cryptocurrency shares, to some degree, is the aforementioned fact that the barrier to entry is relatively low. There's virtually no argument from pundits that blockchain has the potential to change the payment process for a number of industries. The questions are: when will it happen, and which blockchain(s) will be preferred? There's also the real possibility that the underlying blockchain technology that businesses prefer isn't bitcoin's, Litecoin's, or even Ethereum's. There's a lot of competition out there, and preferences can change on a dime. Can Litecoin offer a real challenge to bitcoin's crypto-supremacy? Only time will tell. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"(Reuters) - A rare public spat in the technology industry escalated on Tuesday when Google said it would block its video streaming application YouTube from two Amazon.com Inc devices and criticized the online retailer for not selling Google hardware. The feud is the latest in Silicon Valley to put customers in the crossfire of major competitors. Amazon and Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, square off in many areas, from cloud computing and online search, to selling voice-controlled gadgets like the Google Home and Amazon Echo Show. The stakes are high: many in the technology industry expect that interacting with computers by voice will become widespread, and it is unclear if Amazon, Google or another company will dominate the space. Amazon’s suite of voice-controlled devices has outsold Google’s so far, according to a study by research firm eMarketer from earlier this year. In a statement, Google said, “Amazon doesn’t carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn’t make (its) Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of (our sister company) Nest’s latest products. “Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and Fire TV,” Google said. “We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon.” Amazon said in a statement, “Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website.” It said it hoped to resolve the issue with Google as soon as possible but customers could access YouTube through the internet - not an app - on the devices in the meantime. The break has been a long time coming. Amazon kicked the Chromecast, Google’s television player, off its retail website in 2015, along with Apple Inc’s TV player. Amazon had explained the move by saying it wanted to avoid confusing customers who might expect its Prime Video service to be available on devices sold by Amazon. Amazon and Apple mended ties earlier this year when it was announced Prime Video would come to Apple TV. Not so with Google. In September, Google cut off YouTube from the Amazon Echo Show, which had displayed videos on its touchscreen without video recommendations, channel subscriptions and other features. Amazon later reintroduced YouTube to the device, but the voice commands it added violated the use terms and on Tuesday Google again removed the service. The Fire TV loses access to its YouTube app on Jan. 1, Google said. Amazon has sold that device for longer than the Echo Show, meaning more customers may now be affected. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"The Android Oreo Go operating system can work on entry-level smartphones with memory of as low as 512 megabytes, Google said on Tuesday, adding it expects devices running on the software to start hitting store shelves in the coming months. With 1.2 billion mobile phone subscribers, India’s wireless services market is second only to China’s. But, only about a third of these subscribers currently use smartphones, leaving a vast market for Google, handset and telecom firms to further tap. Although prices of smartphones have fallen sharply in the last few years with Chinese and local phone-makers flooding the market with cheaper handsets, they remain out of reach of a section of customers who are also concerned about a smooth user experience in low-priced phones. “The new lighter operating system, if it works well, will likely attract first-time smartphone buyers to devices retailing in the $30 to $75 range,” said Shobhit Srivastava, an analyst at technology researcher Counterpoint, adding that it would also give Google the opportunity to cross-sell other services like its local payments application Tez that launched in September. Phones running on the new Google mobile operating system will also have access to a special version of its Google Play application store, the company said, highlighting the apps designed to work best on the low-memory smartphones. Even for those 400 million or so already connected to the internet in India, consumption of mobile data has seen a huge spurt following the entry of a new carrier Reliance Jio, backed by the country’s richest man Mukesh Ambani. Jio up-ended the market with initially free and later cut-priced offerings that forced established rivals to slash their prices. Jio currently offers plans that allow users to download up to 1 gigabyte of data per day for less that $3 a month. Among other products, Google announced on Tuesday a version of its Google Assistant for JioPhone - a low-cost 4G-enabled device marketed by Jio. It also unveiled a version of Google maps tailored for two-wheeler users. ","

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"The government ordered the probe as part of wider media reforms, amid growing concern for the future of journalism and the quality of news following years of declining profits and newsroom job cuts and the rise of fake news. “We will examine whether platforms are exercising market power in commercial dealings to the detriment of consumers, media content creators and advertisers,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The inquiry also would study how Facebook and Google operated to “fully understand their influence in Australia”, he added. A Google spokesman said, “We look forward to engaging with this process as relevant.” Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The idea for an ACCC investigation was hatched during media reform negotiations in parliament earlier this year, which resulted in a relaxation of ownership laws to allow the country’s big players to boost their market share to better compete against online disruptors. Independent media analyst Peter Cox told Reuters it was unclear what measures the competition regulator could recommend to the government even if it found the country’s media sector was increasingly anti-competitive. “You could see this as a stepping stone towards another type of reform, such as tax,” said Cox. Jurisdictions around the world, including the European Union, are grappling with how to tax technology giants with global operations. Currently corporate taxes are paid where firms have a physical presence, which allows digital multinationals to book most of their profits where they have set up headquarters as opposed to where they make their money. The Australian probe will have power to demand information from businesses and hold hearings. It is due to make its final report in 18 months.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"Superior Court Judge Mary Wiss in San Francisco said on Monday the lawsuit was inappropriate because it was brought on behalf of all women who worked for Google in California. She gave the plaintiffs 30 days to file a new complaint on behalf of only those women who faced pay discrimination. The decision comes as Google faces an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor into sex bias in its pay practices. Google spokesman Gina Scigliano said the company works “to create a great workplace for everyone.” “If we ever see individual discrepancies or problems, we work to fix them,” she said on Wednesday. James Finberg, a lawyer for the three women who sued Google in September, said he intended to file a new complaint by early January that “makes clear that Google violates the California Equal Pay Act ... by paying women less than men for substantially equal work in nearly every job classification.” The lawsuit appeared to be the first to make sex bias claims against Google on behalf of a class of women, but was only the latest instance of a major tech company being accused of discriminating against women. The Department of Labor sued Oracle America Inc in January, claiming it paid white men more than women and minorities with similar jobs. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Google are a former software engineer, a former communications specialist and a former manager who worked in various roles at the Mountain View, California-based company. They say in the lawsuit that Google pays women in California less than men who perform similar work, and assigns female workers jobs that are less likely to lead to promotions, in violation of state laws. Google has denied the claims and says its employment decisions are made by hiring and promotion committees and are vetted to ensure there is no bias. On Monday, Wiss said the plaintiffs’ claims were vague, and that they must show how specific groups of women were affected by Google’s pay policies. The judge also said that two of the three named plaintiffs had not shown that they performed comparable work to men who were allegedly paid more. The case is Ellis v.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Expansion of artificial intelligence in financial services, healthcare, transportation and other fields poses new challenges to governments charged with regulating those industries, according to an executive with Google who is a pioneer in the field of machine learning. “It’s going to be a big issue,” Geoffrey Hinton, a vice president with Alphabet Inc’s Google, said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in Toronto on Monday. Hinton is a pioneer in the booming field of deep learning, which uses programs known as neural networks to mimic the way humans learn to perform complex tasks including recognizing images, sounds and languages. Hinton led a group of scientists at the University of Toronto who developed some of the key algorithms that neural networks use to crunch massive quantities of data, training themselves to identify patterns so they can mimic the way the human brain would perform tasks such as driving a car, analyzing potential financial trades or using medical images to diagnose diseases. The field has boomed since 2012, when advances in neural networks enabled Google to add voice recognition to Android mobile devices and researchers used it to cut error rates in optical recognition compared with earlier technology, he said. Neural networks teach themselves to perform complex operations, making it impossible for their developers to tell government regulators exactly how those systems work, Hinton said. “All you need is lots and lots of data and lots of information about what the right answer is, and you’ll be able to train a big neural net to do what you want,” he said. Deep learning is close to revolutionizing the way certain diseases are treated. Hinton said neural networks that have studied millions of medical images will be able to make more accurate diagnoses than some physicians. He expects mobile apps to be created that use neural networks to examine images of skin lesions, advising users when to see a doctor for a possible biopsy. “We’d like to make medicine better,” Hinton said.

,12072017,Reuters,11302017,"The tacit endorsement of the event by top U.S. tech executives comes as China introduces strict new rules on censorship and data storage, causing headaches for foreign tech firms permitted to do business in China and signaling that restrictions banning others are unlikely to be lifted any time soon. “I’d compliment the Chinese government in terms of leadership on using data,” Facebook Vice President Vaughan Smith said on Tuesday, citing government bodies such as the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). “The Chinese government, the CAC and MIIT are doing a fabulous job on that.” Facebook and Google aren’t accessible in China behind the country’s Great Firewall, along with major Western news outlets and social media sites, while Apple is subject to strict censorship. The U.S firm removed dozens of popular messaging and virtual private network (VPN) apps from its China App Store this year to comply with government requests. “The theme of this conference, developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits, is a vision we at Apple share,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Sunday. The audience cheered him twice – once when he reached the podium, and again when he bowed. His comments, however, drew criticism in the United States from Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who has previously condemned Apple for removing VPN apps from its China App Store. “Global leaders in innovation, like Apple, have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to promote free expression and other basic human rights in countries that routinely deny these rights,” Leahy said in a statement to CNBC on Tuesday. “It and other tech companies must continue to push back on Chinese suppression of free expression.” China cracks down on any sign of online criticism of the government which it sees as a threat to social stability and one-party rule. Some embassies, business groups and foreign firms steer clear of the highly choreographed internet event, analysts say, because of the perceived propaganda.    But diplomacy seemed to rule the day at the conference, held in the ancient scenic city of Wuzhen in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and neither Smith nor Cook addressed issues of censorship or cyber regulation. Cook has made frequent trips to China over the past year, as the firm has looked to revive sales in the market and make a push into services that require working with local partners on data storage. “Companies that have sent high-level delegations to this conference in Wuzhen in the past have often done so because there is some type of significant issue with their access to the market,” said an industry source familiar with the event who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. At the event itself, conference guests were treated to a bubble of uncensored internet in hotels, including access to Google, Facebook and foreign news outlets with specialized codes handed out to guests. In discussions on topics such as artificial intelligence and tech innovation, overseas executives generally skirted the topic of regulation, though it surfaced at times. “More people come to Facebook than are in China,” said Facebook’s Smith at a talk on digital economy on Tuesday. “(But) I realize not everyone in the room is familiar with Facebook.” “(Foreign companies) are determined to come. Follow the rules and laws and if you’re unhappy, leave,” said Ma. “This is not a market (where) you can come and go.” ","

Uploaders whose videos are flagged by the software may be ineligible for generating ad revenue. But amid stepped up enforcement, the company has received complaints from video uploaders that the software is error-prone. Adding to the thousands of existing content reviewers will give YouTube more data to supply and possibly improve its machine learning software. The goal is to bring the total number of people across Google working to address content that might violate its policies to over 10,000 in 2018, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in one of a pair of blog posts Monday. bit.ly/2km1Dfi “We need an approach that does a better job determining which channels and videos should be eligible for advertising,” she said. “We’ve heard loud and clear from creators that we have to be more accurate when it comes to reviewing content, so we don’t demonetize videos by mistake.” In addition, Wojcicki said the company would take “aggressive action on comments, launching new comment moderation tools and in some cases shutting down comments altogether.” The moves come as advertisers, regulators and advocacy groups express ongoing concern over whether YouTube’s policing of its service is sufficient. YouTube is reviewing its advertising offerings as part of response and it teased that its next efforts could be further changing requirements to share in ad revenue. YouTube this year updated its recommendation feature to spotlight videos users are likely to find the most gratifying, brushing aside concerns that such an approach can trap people in bubbles of misinformation and like-minded opinions.

(MSFT) is gaining a lot of ground. For the third quarter, Futuresource Consulting, a market research and consultancy firm, found that outside the U.S., the use of technology in the classroom is becoming more common, driving demand for Microsoft’s education notebooks and operating system. During the third quarter, the research firm found the mobile PC education market grew 26% internationally with Microsoft's OS the dominant one. The Redmond, Wash., technology giant has been benefiting overseas from big emerging-market deals that boosted its market share. (See also: Why Google Chromebooks Are a Hit in Schools.) In the U.S., Google is still the undisputed leader in education, but it is in a market that is starting to show signs of maturity. According to Futuresource, the mobile PC education market saw several years of double-digit growth, but in the third quarter of this year was up just 3.5% year-over-year. For all of 2017, the research firm is forecasting growth of only 9%. Last year it lodged annual growth of 19%. What’s more, by the end of the year the penetration of mobile PCs will have reached 50%, with a growing portion of the future sales becoming replacement sales. Against that backdrop, competition between Google, Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL) is becoming much fiercer. In May, Microsoft announced a new Surface Laptop and Windows 10S operating system geared toward the education market. The Windows 10 S operating system is streamlined for classroom use, and it’s directly aimed at stealing market share from Google’s Chrome operating system, which powers bare-bones low-cost Chromebook laptops. The new OS enables people to only run applications that are downloaded from the Microsoft’s Windows Store. (See also: Microsoft Targets Ed. Market With New Surface, OS.) Even though Google is still winning in the U.S., Futuresource said there are signs that its growth rate is slowing at the same time Microsoft is gaining market share. With many Chromebooks that were deployed in the 2014-15 school year soon in a need of an upgrade, it remains to be seen if educators will stick with Google or switch to Microsoft or Apple. “Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. Q3 2017 was the first time we saw and heard about a slight shifting of the competitive scenario in the US, with many OEMs and major channel players reporting faster growth (and expected growth) on Windows than Chrome based devices,” wrote Mike Fisher, associate director at Futuresource Consulting, in a research report. “The challenge now for Microsoft will be how to accelerate this trend in 2018. The majority of market demand is expected to be replacement demand; convincing existing Chrome users to completely change the existing ecosystem will likely not be easy due to the time and cost involved.”  ",Microsoft Gains Against Google In Education Mkt. | Investopedia
Rakesh Sharma,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Call it a seminal moment that captures the spirit of our times, if you will. Google searches for the phrase “how to invest in bitcoin” have exceeded those for “how to invest in stocks” during the past year. According to Google search trends, interest in bitcoin investing grew steadily until October 2017, when it suddenly skyrocketed. Last week proved to be the most successful time period for bitcoin investing searches. As bitcoin's price set new record highs over $10,000 – and subsequently over $11,000 – Google search interest for investing in the cryptocurrency jumped from 26 to 100. According to Google, the numbers represent “search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time.” 100 is peak popularity for a given search term, and 50 is half the popularity of its peak. (See also: Bitcoin Price Sets New High And A New Normal). In comparison, search interest for “how to invest in stocks” remained relatively constant over the past year. This is despite a stock market that has also set new highs under a Republican administration. It briefly soared to a new record this morning on the back of enthusiasm regarding the passage of the tax reforms bill last week. While the new record did spur interest in stock investing, it was not enough to overtake interest in bitcoins. Google searches are important because they affect bitcoin’s price by increasing investor numbers and trading volumes. The cryptocurrency is still a nascent entity and its price is influenced by many factors, such as hard forks, that are otherwise unknown in mainstream investing. Google searches are indicative of mainstream investor interest in bitcoin. For example, Coinbase, the world’s largest cryptocurrency wallet, reported the addition of 100,000 new users over the Thanksgiving weekend and reportedly has 13.3 million accounts on its exchange. In contrast, Charles Schwab has 10.6 million active brokerage accounts on its system. As the number of investors within the bitcoin ecosystem increases, the cryptocurrency’s perceived value and price increases. Since Thanksgiving weekend, bitcoin’s price has jumped from around $8,000 to a range of $11,000. For context, stocks as an investment vehicle have been around for more than 400 years, while bitcoins are less than a decade old. Still, it was difficult to beat bitcoin’s performance this year; the cryptocurrency has shot up by more than 1,000 percent in 2017. (See also: The Birth of Stock Exchanges.)

Nathan Reiff,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs A Google search at the time of this writing suggests that the price of a single bitcoin is more than USD$13,000. While much of the news surrounding bitcoin in the past year has been about the tremendous gains, there has been less discussion about the calculation of the value itself, and particularly about how Google (or any other source, for that matter) has determined the value of a bitcoin. Do a search on several different cryptocurrency exchanges around the world at the exact same time, and you're likely to find somewhat different values for a single bitcoin. Why is it that the price of bitcoin varies depending upon where one looks? The primary explanation for discrepancies in bitcoin price across different exchanges is the fact that, as a decentralized digital currency, there is no standard or global bitcoin price at any given period of time. It isn't pegged to the USD or to any other fiat currency, nor is it linked to a particular country or to an exchange. As with commodities of all types, supply and demand vary depending upon the time and the market, and the price of bitcoin fluctuates as a result. Given that there is no global standard for the price of a single bitcoin, how can investors be sure that Google, a digital currency exchange, or another price tracker is accurate? The short answer is that these prices are not, in fact, guaranteed to be accurate at all. A reason for this is that most bitcoin price trackers calculate an average estimate or a recently-traded price of bitcoin based on the transaction history of a prominent bitcoin exchange. Google, for example, bases its figures off of the Coinbase API, which is why it links the value of bitcoin to a U.S. dollar. Beyond the (hopefully modest) inaccuracies built into a price tracker or search engine when it comes to estimating the cost of a single bitcoin, investors should also keep in mind that the actual price of buying that coin in an exchange is likely to be higher. The reason for this is that most exchanges require some type of transaction fee. This is typically very modest in comparison to the price of a bitcoin, particularly as bitcoin's value has skyrocketed in recent months, but it does further introduce inaccuracies into the price that you may see listed. Finally, bitcoin exchanges link up those who have bitcoin and wish to sell with those looking to buy. Different exchanges may have different levels of supply and demand, and the price may be somewhat different. Of course, if the price on one exchange is markedly lower than on another, that alone is likely to shift the supply and demand levels further.

Mark Kolakowski,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Large cap mutual funds are on pace for their best year since 2009, and overweight positions in technology stocks have driven much of the gains, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reports. However, these funds started the third quarter underweight in the five giant FAAMG​ tech stocks as a group, and reduced their exposure yet further by the start of the fourth quarter, per Goldman. In fact, of the six stocks whose positioning in big mutual funds dropped the most during the third quarter, five of them were the FAAMGs. In measuring positioning, Goldman compares these stocks' weights in mutual fund portfolios to their weights in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Among all stocks, and not just the FAAMGs, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is the most underweight in large cap fund portfolios, Goldman says. These funds also are underweight in FAAMG components Facebook Inc. (FB), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). They are overweight in Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), the parent of Google, but have reduced their allocation to it. Meanwhile, FAANG​ component Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is another big tech stock in which large cap funds are now underweight, per Goldman's November 30 report, ""Mutual funds cut FAAMG exposure but remain overweight Tech."" (For more, see also: Stock Valuations Highest Since 1929 Crash, Dotcom Bubble.) For the five FAAMG stocks, their year-to-date share price gains through the end of the third quarter (September 30), their gains for the fourth quarter to date through December 1, and their current forward P/E ratios are below. Most of the FAAMG stocks remain pricier than the S&P 500 average: Forward P/E data is per Thomson Reuters, as reported by Yahoo Finance. (For more, see also: How Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet Are Killing The Bears.) Goldman examined 495 mutual funds with a collective $1.9 trillion of assets under management (AUM). They excluded ETFs​ and index objective funds from their positioning analysis. These funds started the third quarter underweight by 84 basis points (bps) in the FAAMGs as a group, but started the fourth quarter underweight by 164 bps. They already were underweight in Apple, Microsoft and Amazon at the start of the third quarter, and cut their allocations to all five FAAMG stocks during the quarter. Facebook swung from overweight to underweight during the quarter. As mentioned, of all stocks in the S&P 500 Apple is the most underweight in the mutual fund portfolios examined by Goldman, by 113 bps at the start of the fourth quarter. Alphabet, by contrast, is the second most overweight stock, by 21 bps, but this is down from 37 bps at the start of the third quarter. Despite their underweight position in the FAAMGs, the mutual funds studied by Goldman are still betting heavily on information technology stocks, with this remaining the most overweight sector. However, their overweight position in tech was reduced during the third quarter from 144 bps at the start to 109 bps at the end, Goldman notes. Without offering specific reasons for the shift, Goldman finds that the mutual funds it studied moved closer to market weights for nine of the eleven S&P 500 sectors. The only exceptions were health care, which increased from 32 to 52 bps overweight, and energy, which dropped from 31 to 34 bps underweight. Additionally, Goldman notes that funds' relative allocations to ""bond-proxies"" telecom and consumer staples are now at their highest levels in five years. All this may indicate a more defensive stance among fund managers, as well as an expectation that market leadership may rotate in the late stages of the bull market and economic cycle.

They are so perennially popular that other companies have repeatedly attempted to make inroads into the selective ""FANG"" group (you'll see FAANG as an acronym representing the above-mentioned companies as well as Alibaba, for instance). While the grouping of these four companies into ""FANG"" is somewhat arbitrary and a designation made by investors as a time-saving tool, there are new and practical implications for the FANG grouping as of late in November. Late last month, Intercontinental Exchange launched futures which track these four companies, allowing for investors to easily trade in those areas without buying into the costly shares of each company directly. The new offering, called NYSE FANG+ Index Futures, includes not only the four FANG stocks as well as several others. Together, the group of 10 stocks aims to ""represent the top innovators across today's tech and internet/media companies,"" according to a release from the Exchange which was reported on by Business Insider. One unique feature of the grouping is that, unlike major indexes and ETFs which typically track them, the FANG+ grouping will be equal-weighted. This means that the largest stocks among the group won't hold proportional (and outsized) influence over the others. FANG stocks have surged by more than 40% so far this year, a figure which roughly triples the growth of the S&P 500. They provide investors with an opportunity to be involved in the most popular tech companies in the world. FANG+ futures, on the other hand, can be used by investors looking to make bullish bets in that area. On the other hand, if the futures are shorted or sold, they can also be put to use as a hedge against losses in those 10 companies, or they can represent a more broad bearish position relative to the group. Business Insider argues that ""FANG+ futures could even be used as a hedge against declines in the broader stock market...going off the idea that as mega-cap tech goes, so does the market, FANG+ could serve as a useful market proxy."" An advantage of the FANG+ futures product over its closest competitor, the First Trump Dow Jones Internet Index Fund, is that FANG+ does not receive about a third of its weighting from the original FANG stocks, as the Dow Jones fund does. So long as the FANG companies continue to dominate as they have this year, it's likely that investors will continue to make bets using both of these investment vehicles.

Investopedia,12072017,Investopedia,11302017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs First, do not confuse different classes of common stock with preferred stock. Preferred shares are an entirely different type of security, affording their owners priority dividend payments and a higher position on the priority ladder in the event of a company's liquidation or bankruptcy. Common stock represents the lower-ranked (and much more prevalent) form of equity financing. However, a company can choose to issue different classes of common stock to certain investors, board members or company founders. Generally, companies that choose to have multiple classes of common stock issue two classes, usually denoted as Class A and Class B shares. Common practice is to assign more voting rights to one class of stock than the other. For example, a private company that decides to go public will usually issue a large number of common shares, but the occasional company will also provide its founders, executives or other large stakeholders with a different class of common stock that carries multiple votes for each single share of stock. Commonly, the ""super voting"" multiple is about 10 votes per higher class share, although occasionally companies choose to make them much higher. Usually, Class A shares are superior to Class B shares, but there is no standard nomenclature for multiple share classes. Sometimes Class B shares have more votes than their Class A counterparts. Because of this, investors should always research the details of a company's share classes if they are considering investing in a firm with more than one class. Usually, the purpose of the super voting shares is to give key company insiders greater control over the company's voting rights, and thus its board and corporate actions. The existence of super voting shares can also be an effective defense against hostile takeovers, since key insiders can maintain majority voting control of their company without actually owning more than half of the outstanding shares. Voting issues aside, different share classes typically have the same rights to profits and company ownership. Thus, even though retail investors may be limited to purchasing only inferior classes of common stock for a given company, they still enjoy a proportionally equal claim to the company's profits. In these cases, investors see their fair share of a company's returns on equity, although they do not enjoy the voting power their shares would normally provide in the absence of dual classes. Provided the large stakeholders who own the disproportionate voting shares are successful in running the company, this should be of little concern to investors - especially the typical retail investor who has a very tiny stake in the company anyway.

(MSFT) is gaining a lot of ground. For the third quarter, Futuresource Consulting, a market research and consultancy firm, found that outside the U.S., the use of technology in the classroom is becoming more common, driving demand for Microsoft’s education notebooks and operating system. During the third quarter, the research firm found the mobile PC education market grew 26% internationally with Microsoft's OS the dominant one. The Redmond, Wash., technology giant has been benefiting overseas from big emerging-market deals that boosted its market share. (See also: Why Google Chromebooks Are a Hit in Schools.) In the U.S., Google is still the undisputed leader in education, but it is in a market that is starting to show signs of maturity. According to Futuresource, the mobile PC education market saw several years of double-digit growth, but in the third quarter of this year was up just 3.5% year-over-year. For all of 2017, the research firm is forecasting growth of only 9%. Last year it lodged annual growth of 19%. What’s more, by the end of the year the penetration of mobile PCs will have reached 50%, with a growing portion of the future sales becoming replacement sales. Against that backdrop, competition between Google, Microsoft and Apple Inc. (AAPL) is becoming much fiercer. In May, Microsoft announced a new Surface Laptop and Windows 10S operating system geared toward the education market. The Windows 10 S operating system is streamlined for classroom use, and it’s directly aimed at stealing market share from Google’s Chrome operating system, which powers bare-bones low-cost Chromebook laptops. The new OS enables people to only run applications that are downloaded from the Microsoft’s Windows Store. (See also: Microsoft Targets Ed. Market With New Surface, OS.) Even though Google is still winning in the U.S., Futuresource said there are signs that its growth rate is slowing at the same time Microsoft is gaining market share. With many Chromebooks that were deployed in the 2014-15 school year soon in a need of an upgrade, it remains to be seen if educators will stick with Google or switch to Microsoft or Apple. “Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. Q3 2017 was the first time we saw and heard about a slight shifting of the competitive scenario in the US, with many OEMs and major channel players reporting faster growth (and expected growth) on Windows than Chrome based devices,” wrote Mike Fisher, associate director at Futuresource Consulting, in a research report. “The challenge now for Microsoft will be how to accelerate this trend in 2018. The majority of market demand is expected to be replacement demand; convincing existing Chrome users to completely change the existing ecosystem will likely not be easy due to the time and cost involved.”  ",Microsoft Gains Against Google In Education Mkt. | Investopedia
Daniel Liberto,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has introduced a number of new features to Bing and is using artificial intelligence (AI) to make its search engine smarter, more reliable and better equipped to take on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google. At an AI-focused event in San Francisco, the Redmond, Washington-based company revealed that Bing now has the ability to measure how many reputable sources are behind a given answer, as well as summarize opposing perspectives to contentious questions. These new capabilities are designed to make Bing a more “trustworthy” source of information, the company said in a blog post. Microsoft’s leveraging of its AI research to enhance the reliability of Bing forms part of its strategy to better challenge Google’s dominant position as the world’s number one search engine. The move also came at a time when the credibility of search engines has been called into question, due to a surge in fake news. (See also: Apple Replaces Bing With Google in Siri and Spotlight.) “As a search engine we have a responsibility to provide answers that are comprehensive and objective,” said Jordi Ribas, Microsoft's corporate vice president for AI products. Ribas provided examples of how Bing’s new features offer multiple opposing viewpoints to certain questions. For instance, users curious to know if coffee is good for them will be presented with different perspectives from sources. One makes a case about coffee’s ability to increase metabolism, while another references how it can raise blood pressure. Similar results can be found for more sensitive questions. Microsoft’s new AI-powered features have been extended to images, too. Users can now search for images within images — and even buy items they find there, such as jewelry worn by a celebrity. To further improve the effectiveness of search results, Microsoft also announced a new partnership with Reddit. As part of the deal, content from the popular online forum will now be filtered into Bing. (See also: Apple, Microsoft Will Drive 2018 Tech Earnings Growth: Moody's.) “Bing users whose queries are best answered with relevant Reddit conversations, will see those conversations at the top of the page, easily getting perspectives from millions of Reddit users,” the San Francisco, California-based company said in a blog post explaining the partnership.

Record label Warner Music Group has already confirmed its participation, the sources said. Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Merlin, a consortium of independent labels, are reportedly in talks with the video streaming website. YouTube, which hired former Warner Music executive Lyor Cohen last year to oversee its music operations and serve as a liaison to the record business, is also believed to be reaching out to artists to help promote its new service and generate support. Cohen previously revealed the company’s plans to combine its YouTube Red video subscription service with Alphabet’s existing Google Play Music offering back in July, according to The Verge. Bloomberg’s sources said that YouTube has been attempting to negotiate new deals with Universal and Sony for more than a year. To make its March deadline, the company will need to conclude those talks soon. The record industry has for years criticized YouTube for not compensating labels enough.

Joe Liebkind,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Despite bitcoin’s relative youth at just under 10 years old, its fervent popularity has spawned a cryptocurrency revolution and several competitors. An influx of new money from both retail investors and institutional entities means that these alternative cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins”, are under new scrutiny as traders look to diversify away from bitcoin. One of the most prominent among them is Litecoin, in terms of mass appeal, market capitalization and potential for adoption. Litecoin was launched in the shadow of bitcoin, yet was inspired by the ‘King Coin’, particularly by its decentralized approach to currency. The founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, is a former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges and the first to list Litecoin alongside bitcoin and Ethereum. Though many see Litecoin as a bitcoin clone, it has technical differences that separate the two in the eyes of many. It is largely these differences that inform Litecoin’s price alongside the favorable image it maintains with traders and businesses alike. Made in the image of bitcoin in its early days, Litecoin was one of the first to take its predecessor’s formula and tweak it. The first change relates to Litecoin’s blockchain, which uses the Scrypt protocol instead of SHA256. While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run bitcoin’s network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting. Naturally, Litecoin has enjoyed an increasing rate of adoption within cryptocurrency services and in the retail market as well that corresponds with its distinct advantages. [ Litecoin's increasing popularity mirrors the growing enthusiasm for cryptocurrency across the globe. Many people are eager to enter the crypto market, but it's important to have a sound understanding of how the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology work before diving in. Investopedia Academy's Cryptocurrency for Beginners course arms you with the knowledge and tools you need to successfully enter the realm of cryptocurrency. Check it out today! ] The most prominent characteristic of Litecoin is also one that gives it the most potential for disruption and inspires much confidence within the cryptocurrency community. As soon as Segregated Witness was released as a proposed blockchain upgrade to allow speedier off-chain transactions, Litecoin threw its full weight behind the proposal and was the first to integrate it. SegWit will allow Litecoin and others who adopt it to use the Lightning Network, which is nearing completion, empowering participants to exchange cryptocurrencies at virtually no cost. Developers are quickly making headway on the Lightning Network, and it has recently passed almost all the quality assurance tests required to be released to the public. In a recent dry run, an alpha version was used to purchase coffee in Starbucks with no fees: a result hard to obtain with any other payment solution. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts with many coins to explore have increasingly highlighted Litecoin due to its speed. In tests where one user compared the speed of coins being transferred from an exchange to a hardware wallet like Trezor, Litecoin performed best, transferring 23 coins in under 10 seconds. Businesses paying attention to Litecoin’s fast advancements on the payment front are increasingly adopting it into their own ecosystems as well. The ease of transacting with Litecoin makes eCommerce one of the most suitable environments for adoption, and stores like BTCTrip, Bitify, AllThingsLuxury, and Bitcoin.shop (as well as others) have joined in. Even popular retail ecommerce giant Overstock.com is accepting Litecoin as a form of payment.  People can easily pay for gifts, vacations, household appliances, and even precious metals and gems with their Litecoin. While retail adoption is encouraging, cryptocurrency, merchants, exchanges, wallets and other infrastructure are also integrating Litecoin in growing numbers. Ultimately, any cryptocurrency’s success is the function of its applicability and the problems it solves.  Even though traders may not fully understand the differences between Litecoin’s and bitcoin’s DNA, they are increasingly moving to Litecoin, regardless. All they see is how prices behave relative to other coins. Litecoin is just as accessible as bitcoin in this regard because it’s been a centerpiece in the market for almost as long, meaning that any service leaving Litecoin out of the equation is ultimately limiting their own audience and appeal. Apart from the obvious advantages from a design perspective and trading appeal, participants themselves are benefiting from the ecosystem thanks to growing adoption in ecommerce.  As one of the major cryptocurrencies, Litecoin is quickly becoming a contender for the top three spots, even as a funding tool. Bankex, a unique platform designed to validate and tokenize more illiquid assets like real estate and venture capital portfolios, is accepting Litecoin alongside bitcoin and Ethereum during its token sale. Platforms like Bankex almost unanimously accept Litecoin because many customers will exchange their other cryptocurrencies for Litecoin in anticipation of a transaction. Until the Lightning Network levels the playing field, investors who want to participate in Bankex’s plethora of autonomously evaluated Smart Assets may prefer to fund the ICO with Litecoin to save on fees. Although Ethereum still takes the cake in the fundraising sphere due to ERC20, Litecoin likely makes it to one of the top three spots on the Bankex token sale list because of its rapidly broadening appeal and more affordable transfer costs. Between high demand as both an asset and as a currency, it behaves as a hybrid with much more potential longevity than its aging brother. Litecoin’s drama-free community and even keel give it less volatility and a steady trend, making it great for arbitration, trading, spending, or even fundraising. Savvy cryptocurrency enthusiasts have compared bitcoin’s market capitalization to Litecoin and done the math based on its maximum number of coins and other traits and have almost unanimously declared that it is undervalued. Even so, with much progress being made on the Lightning Network, Litecoin may one day soon evolve into the truest form of cryptocurrency yet, and leave the others in the dust.

Ben McClure,12142017,Investopedia,12072017,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs If you were to craft the perfect investment, you would probably want its attributes to include high returns and low risk. The reality, of course, is that this kind of investment is next to impossible to find. Not surprisingly, people spend a lot of time developing methods and strategies that come close to the ""perfect investment."" But none have been popular as modern portfolio theory (MPT). Here, we look at the basic ideas behind MPT, its pros and cons, and how it how it should factor into your portfolio management. One of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment, MPT was developed by Harry Markowitz and published under the title ""Portfolio Selection"" in the Journal of Finance in 1952. The theory is based on Markowitz's hypothesis that it is possible for investors to design an optimal portfolio to maximize returns by taking on a quantifiable amount of risk. Essentially, investors can reduce risk through diversification using a quantitative method. Modern portfolio theory says that it is not enough to look at the expected risk and return of one particular stock. By investing in more than one stock, an investor can reap the benefits of diversification – chief among them, a reduction in the riskiness of the portfolio. MPT quantifies the benefits of diversification, or not putting all of your eggs in one basket. For most investors, the risk they take when they buy a stock is that the return will be lower than expected. In other words, it is the deviation from the average return. Each stock has its own standard deviation from the mean, which modern portfolio theory calls ""risk."" The risk in a portfolio of diverse individual stocks will be less than the risk inherent in holding any one of the individual stocks, provided the risks of the various stocks are not directly related. Consider a portfolio that holds two risky stocks: one that pays off when it rains and another that pays off when it doesn't rain. A portfolio that contains both assets will always pay off, regardless of whether it rains or shines. Adding one risky asset to another can reduce the overall risk of an all-weather portfolio. In other words, Markowitz showed that investment is not just about picking stocks, but about choosing the right combination of stocks among which to distribute one's nest egg. Modern portfolio theory states that the risk for individual stock returns has two components: Systematic Risk – These are market risks that cannot be diversified away. Interest rates, recessions and wars are examples of systematic risks. Unsystematic Risk – Also known as ""specific risk,"" this risk is specific to individual stocks, such as a change in management or a decline in operations. This kind of risk can be diversified away as you increase the number of stocks in your portfolio (see Figure 1). It represents the component of a stock's return that is not correlated with general market moves. For a well-diversified portfolio, the risk – or average deviation from the mean – of each stock contributes little to portfolio risk. Instead, it is the difference _ or covariance – between individual stock's levels of risk that determines overall portfolio risk. As a result, investors benefit from holding diversified portfolios instead of individual stocks. Now that we understand the benefits of diversification, the question of how to identify the best level of diversification arises. Enter the efficient frontier. For every level of return, there is one portfolio that offers the lowest possible risk, and for every level of risk, there is a portfolio that offers the highest return. These combinations can be plotted on a graph, and the resulting line is the efficient frontier. Figure 2 shows the efficient frontier for just two stocks – a high risk/high return technology stock (like Google) and a low risk/low return consumer products stock (like Coca-Cola). Any portfolio that lies on the upper part of the curve is efficient: It gives the maximum expected return for a given level of risk. A rational investor will only ever hold a portfolio that lies somewhere on the efficient frontier. The maximum level of risk that the investor will take on determines the position of the portfolio on the line. Modern portfolio theory takes this idea even further. It suggests that combining a stock portfolio that sits on the efficient frontier with a risk-free asset, the purchase of which is funded by borrowing, can actually increase returns beyond the efficient frontier. In other words, if you were to borrow to acquire a risk-free stock, then the remaining stock portfolio could have a riskier profile and, therefore, a higher return than you might otherwise choose. Modern portfolio theory has had a marked impact on how investors perceive risk, return and portfolio management. The theory demonstrates that portfolio diversification can reduce investment risk. In fact, modern money managers routinely follow its precepts. Passive investing also incorporates MPT as investors choose index funds that are low cost and well-diversified. Losses in any individual stock are not material enough to damage performance due to the diversification, and the success and prevalence of passive investing is an indication of the ubiquity of modern portfolio theory. That being said, MPT has some shortcomings in the real world. For starters, it often requires investors to rethink notions of risk. Sometimes it demands that the investor take on a perceived risky investment (futures, for example) in order to reduce overall risk. That can be a tough sell to an investor not familiar with the benefits of sophisticated portfolio management techniques. Furthermore, MPT assumes that it is possible to select stocks whose individual performance is independent of other investments in the portfolio. But market historians have shown that there are no such instruments. In times of market stress, seemingly independent investments do act as though they are related. Likewise, it is logical to borrow to hold a risk-free asset and increase your portfolio returns, but finding a truly risk-free asset is another matter. Government-backed bonds are presumed to be risk free, but, in reality, they are not. Securities such as gilts and U.S. Treasury bonds are free of default risk, but expectations of higher inflation and interest rate changes can both affect their value. Then there is the question of the number of stocks required for diversification. How many is enough? Mutual funds can contain dozens and dozens of stocks. Investment guru William J. Bernstein says that even 100 stocks is not enough to diversify away unsystematic risk. By contrast, Edwin J. Elton and Martin J. Gruber in their book ""Modern Portfolio Theory And Investment Analysis"" (1981), conclude that you would come very close to achieving optimal diversity after adding the 20th stock. The gist of MPT is that the market is hard to beat and that the people who beat the market are those who take above-average risk. It is also implied that these risk takers will get their comeuppance when markets turn down. Then again, investors such as Warren Buffett remind us that portfolio theory is just that – theory. At the end of the day, a portfolio's success rests on the investor's skills and the time he or she devotes to it. Sometimes it is better to pick a small number of out-of-favor investments and wait for the market to turn in your favor than to rely on market averages alone.

And there was nothing explicitly related to Donald Trump, though that could be because Google specifically features search items that saw a spike in traffic this year from 2016. While Google's annual list of trending searches is always a nice little window into our collective curiosity, the actual list of the year's top searches is significantly less interesting. Because internet users have an apparent aversion to typing in web addresses, the most searched words are things like Facebook, Google, Craigslist and YouTube, along with, of course, weather. Google also gleaned that the top three ""What is..."" searches: DACA, bitcoin and solar eclipse.

Jillian D'Onfro,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"Advocates on both sides of the net neutrality debate are calling out Google for apparent hypocrisy this week after it blocked YouTube from working on Amazon's FireTV product. People who watch a lot of YouTube videos through their Amazon streaming devices got a nasty surprise Tuesday when YouTube announced it would cut its video service from the FireTV by Jan. 1 due to a ""lack of reciprocity"" from the retail company. Amazon doesn't sell most of Google's hardware products and doesn't make its Prime Video service available on Google's Chromecast. Meanwhile, Google, Amazon, and tens of thousands of other tech companies have stood up against the Federal Communication Commission's plans to repeal net neutrality protections, arguing that rolling back Obama-era rules could allow internet service providers to start blocking content or slowing down data from certain sites. Advocates on the side of the ISPs say that YouTube's latest move proves that these companies aren't as dedicated to a ""free and open internet"" as they say. ""The whole point of net neutrality was supposed to be that the consumer could get what they want how they want on the internet,"" says Scott Cleland, a chairman of NetCompetition, a forum supported by ISPs.""That's why this is so hypocritical."" John Spalter, of the trade association USTelecom, echoes the sentiment: ""Broadband ISPs are committed to providing an open internet for their customers, including protections like no content blocking or throttling. Seems like some of the biggest internet companies can't say the same. Ironic, isn't it?"" People on Twitter are calling foul, too, highlighting how the move shows that the tech giants are infringing on the ethos that they're apparently fighting to protect: Tweet Tweet Tweet Tweet With this latest announcement, Google is essentially blocking some users from using what is usually a free and open website. ""It looks like Google is putting corporate interests ahead of openness, and the interests of consumers,"" says John Bergmayer, of PublicKnowledge. The organization also criticizes Amazon's refusal to put its video service on Google devices. Today, people are protesting net neutrality repeal at hundreds of Verizon stores across the country, and Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, which supports the protests, says this latest spat between Amazon and Google highlights that the net neutrality fight shouldn't be about ""what the biggest names in Silicon Valley"" think, but defending small businesses, startups, and regular internet users. ""This is exactly why we need net neutrality,"" she says. Neither Amazon nor Google returned request for comment. The FCC is expected to vote on rescinding net neutrality rules on December 14.

Over the course of 2017, the search engine has become publishers' main source of external page views, according to new data from Parse.ly, a digital analytics company. It's basically a flip from the beginning of the year: In January, Facebook provided nearly 40 percent of publishers' external traffic; now that's down to 26 percent. And Google, which started the year at 34 percent, now generates 44 percent of traffic. Parse.ly's data comes from some 2,500 publishers that use its analytics service, including the Wall Street Journal, Time Inc., Mashable and Huffington Post.

Arjun Kharpal,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"ABI Research defines the post-smartphone world as one where new, hands-free interfaces — such as those that use the human voice — need to be developed. This will include more artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality, and virtual reality. The research company made an assessment of patent portfolios, research and development spend, acquisitions and contributions to open source communities to evaluate and compare 10 major technology players from Facebook to Microsoft and Samsung. It concluded that Amazon and Google will ""lead and drive innovation around smartphones and related ecosystems"" in the next six years. ""This next wave of innovation in the smart device ecosystem will be led by Google and Amazon, as their apparent strength in major growth sectors, notably computer science, allows for a more flexible approach to next-generation user experiences that are essential for creating immersive experiences and brand-new ways of human-to-machine interactions,"" David McQueen, research director at ABI Research, said in a press release. ABI's report said Apple will ""lag due to innovation complacency."" Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. McQueen explained that established device makers like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft will be ""followers"" in the new market and are ""not currently as well set up to drive future innovation,"" mainly due to their legacy hardware businesses. But they should not be dismissed because they have a ""major influence on the market"" through brand and market share. All of the major technology players are trying to release new products beyond the smartphone, with many focusing on smart digital assistants. Amazon has its Echo smart speaker with the AI voice assistant Alexa built in. The U.S. e-commerce giant has been releasing several different versions of the Echo and has also been integrating Alexa with other products from device makers. Meanwhile, Google has brought out a rival product called Google Home with its own smart assistant. And Apple is gearing up to launch its competitor to the Echo called the HomePod, with its voice assistant Siri built in. Samsung has also been trying to push its own digital assistant called Bixby on its new Galaxy S8 and Note 8 smartphones. CNBC also reported in August that Samsung is set to launch its own smart speaker next year. Voice assistants appear to be the next big battleground as technology companies look to offer new experiences and ways to interact with devices beyond the touchscreens on smartphones. But winning the market could require a lot of money. ""There will be a requirement for significant investment in the underpinning technologies and technical expertise as well as the creation of 'intelligent phones' that are able to effectively leverage these forthcoming technologies,"" ABI Research said.

Home to fast-growing economies such as Indonesia and the Philippines, Southeast Asia boasts a massive internet user base that's overwhelmingly focused on mobile. That will push the region's internet economy to hit $50 billion this year and $200 billion by 2025, growing from 2 percent of regional gross domestic product to 6 percent by 2025, the report said. ""Users in Southeast Asia are incredibly engaged, spending an average of 3.6 hours per day on mobile internet, more than in any other region in the world ... These incredible levels of engagement have led to a sizable market opportunity."" Focusing on e-commerce, ride hailing and overall venture capital investments, the report highlighted just how explosive Southeast Asia's internet economy is. E-commerce sales of first-hand goods will reach $10.9 billion in gross merchandise value this year, up from $5.5 billion in 2015, the report found. Momentum is chiefly driven by mobile-first marketplaces such as Lazada and Tokopedia, where small and medium businesses sell to consumers. Ride hailing services are expected to hit $5.1 billion in gross merchandise value this year, more double from $2.5 billion in 2015, and could reach $20.1 billion in 2025, the report said. Players such as Grab and Go-Jek have also expanded their offerings beyond consumer transportation to focus on payments and lifestyle services, increasing their attraction to customers, the report said. Between 2016 and the third quarter of this year, Southeast Asian internet companies raised more than $12 billion of capital, up from $1 billion in 2015, the report stated. Venture capital investments in these firms stood at 0.18 percent of Southeast Asian GDP in 2016, on par with India and narrowing the gap with China's 0.30 percent figure, the report said.

Todd Haselton,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"As CNBC's in-house gadget reviewer, I tested dozens of new devices for the site this year. While there were a ton of successful products that I love, there were also a few blunders and missteps. Some trends even left me scratching my head. Here's a look at some of the tech blunders from 2017. I love the idea, but the reality didn't live up to expectations. Amazon Key was supposed to change the way packages are delivered. Amazon's smart lock and camera system enables delivery drivers to enter your home, but they won't if you have a loose dog and, worse, will set off your security alarm unless you turn it off for the day (who does that, anyway?) Amazon can improve it in 2018 by embedding with security systems, but I'm not sure how it'll skirt the problem with little Fido. I loved the 2016 Pixel and Pixel XL, but this year's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL fell short of expectations. It started with a variety of bugs, like buzzing noises to screen problems. Google quickly fixed some of them, but it's still missing some features that are available elsewhere. The Pixel 2 XL screen still has bad viewing angles (a hardware problem), and neither phone offers wireless charging or expandable storage, which you can get from the Galaxy S8. The software is great, but the price — $649 for the Pixel 2 and $849 for larger XL model — is too high for what you get. It started with Motorola and Apple phones and quickly spread to almost every other new smartphone, save for Samsung's flagships. The 3.5mm headphone jack in smartphones is basically dead. I switched to Bluetooth headphones long ago, but now smartphone makers are practically pushing everyone to — that, or deal with USB-C headphones, which are just clunky and require an adapter if you use your own favorite set of buds. Google had another blunder this year: the Pixel Buds. At $159, they were supposed to compete with Apple AirPods but ultimately fell way short in quality and performance. Worse, a new feature that's supposed to translate languages in real time barely worked in our tests, largely because the headphones' microphone didn't work very well outdoors. Kudos for the great idea to Google, though. Maybe Pixel Buds 2 will improve the delivery. Android Wear — Google's smartwatch operating system and the gadgets that run on it — has lagged far behind the Apple Watch recently, and these two smartwatches were supposed to improve the situation. Neither were very good, both outclassed by other Android Wear watches. Worse, while Google recently released a new version of Android Wear, it seems to have taken a back seat to Android as a whole. While I once loved Android Wear, there isn't a model I'd recommend over alternative from Samsung and Apple right now. The Fitbit Ionic was almost too buggy to review when it crossed my desk. It had a lack of apps, was prone to crashing and some tracking seemed wildly inaccurate (like my sleep tests.) After two different units, I published an unfavorable review and recommended most folks stick to more affordable wearables or the Apple Watch. New software that began rolling out this week may vastly improve the Fitbit Ionic, but the original software left a sour taste in my mouth after two units failed to work. Apple's HomePod speaker was originally supposed to launch this year to take on the Amazon Echo and Google Home, but it apparently needs more time in oven. Bummer. It's one of the gadgets I was looking forward to trying most, particularly since Apple's promising a really great-sounding speaker that should work with iPhones, the Apple TV and more. It's now expected to launch in early 2018. I love(d) the Essential phone, but the product fizzled out pretty darn quick considering it was developed by the co-creator of Android, Andy Rubin. While its hardware was fantastic and its software great, Essential has reportedly struggled to sell units of the device -- one report placed sales at just 5,000 units sold. It didn't help that Essential delayed some colors, didn't push out accessories fast enough and started by selling the phone as a Sprint exclusive. Its Black Friday price at $399 probably should have been the launch price. And now Rubin has taken a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons.

Jordan Novet,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"Chipmakers focused on artificial intelligence are in a race to get their hardware out the door, a theme that's on full display this week at a major industry event in Southern California. A little-known start-up called Wave Computing shared exhibit floor space with tech giants including Google and Microsoft at the 31st annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference. Wave is showcasing a motherboard sitting inside a glass case, but one key component is missing: a processor. The chip itself will be ready ""very soon,"" Lee Flanagin, Wave's senior vice president and chief business officer, told CNBC. Graphcore, a European AI start-up, similarly has space on the floor but doesn't have a chip to show. In fact, the company is even without a board at the conference. Graphcore said in July that its chips would become available to early customers before the end of the year, but the timing has since slipped to ""the start of 2018."" A well-funded start-up called Cerebras is among other industry newbies with representatives floating around the sold-out NIPS conference. There's an expected gold rush coming to AI as engineers demand more advanced processors to handle a flurry of new and sophisticated workloads — like learning to recognize people in video feeds or translating speech into different languages — while also saving power. Many researchers rely on graphics cards from the likes of Nvidia to implement a popular type of AI called deep learning, but new AI chip companies are luring venture capital investments with the promise of serving the next generation of computing. Start-ups are facing stiff competition. Google has come up with chips that can work in place of Nvidia's graphics cards for deep learning. Those chips aren't yet available for rent on Google's cloud. Google is expected to talk about the performance of its chips later this week. And there's Intel, which has a big booth near the entrance to the NIPS exhibition hall. Intel recently announced plans to make discrete graphics cards and paid over $400 million to acquire AI chip start-up Nervana. In October, Intel said it would ship its first Nervana products before the end of 2017. On Tuesday, at Intel's NIPS party, the rapper Flo Rida performed — and the company used the occasion to show off its first processor, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email. The chip is now available, and Intel is working with a set of close partners on it, the spokesperson said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the company's most recent earnings call that investors will start to see Nervana chips reflected in the company's financials ""towards the back end probably of 2018.""

Alex Sherman,12142017,CNBC,12072017,"Microsoft and Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about a Broadcom takeover, according to people familiar with the matter. The companies are wary of Apple's potential influence over a deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. They're also worried about Broadcom's reputation of cutting costs rather than investing in new technology, the people said. Qualcomm rejected a hostile $105 billion bid last month, leading to Broadcom nominating a new slate of board directors for the San Diego-based company earlier this week. Regulators frequently ask for industry input when making a judgment on whether or not to approve a deal. Qualcomm has said it has antitrust concerns about a potential Broadcom takeover. Qualcomm has told Microsoft, Google and other companies not to make any public statements  opposing a deal, said the sources. Qualcomm wants to find out if Broadcom will significantly increase its $70-per-share offer before taking a firmer stance against a possible deal, said the people. A Broadcom transaction for Qualcomm may improve Apple's relationship with the chipmaker, which currently provides chips used in the iPhone and iPad.  Qualcomm is suing Apple for patent infringement after Apple in January sued Qualcomm for roughly $1 billion, claiming Qualcomm charged royalties improperly. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents covering, among other things, smartphone technology. The litigation could result in Apple abandoning Qualcomm for future products. But Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has privately expressed optimism about settling an ongoing litigation with Apple if Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple's gain could be its competition's loss. In Google's case, many of the phone and tablet makers who build phones on its market-leading Android operating system use Qualcomm processors. Android and its derivatives make up 85 percent of the smartphone market, according to IDC. Microsoft just announced the first Windows 10 PCs using Qualcomm chips, and it may continue to push these types of tablet and hybrid PCs, which use less power than traditional Intel-based PCs, as it seeks to compete with Apple's iPad. While Microsoft and Google are two of the largest companies in the world, neither rival Apple or Samsung in terms of sales volume from either Qualcomm or Broadcom. Still, both Microsoft and Google perceive an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm that is tighter with Apple. The companies have also privately expressed concerns with Tan's reputation of cutting costs at the expense of increasing spending on innovation, two of the people said. Complaints from these third parties could play a role in scuppering the deal. In the press release announcing the proposed buyout, Tan said ""We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination."" Spokespeople for Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Google declined to comment. A spokesperson for Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment. ","Microsoft, Google concerned about Broadcom-Qualcomm deal"

He will continue to serve on the company's board. Schmidt first joined Google as CEO in 2001, back when the company only had several hundred employees, and became its executive chairman 10 years later. He maintained that role when Google restructured to become Alphabet in 2015.

From that date, Chrome will block ads that breach the ""Better Ads Standards,"" guidelines developed by an industry coalition. This means that the most annoying types of messages, such as pop-up ads, auto-play videos with sound and flashing animated ads will be removed. ""Starting on February 15, in line with the Coalition's guidelines, Chrome will remove all ads from sites that have a 'failing' status in the Ad Experience Report for more than 30 days,"" a post on Google's developer blog stated. The Ad Experience Report will highlight ads on a website that breach the ad standards and may identify the issues publishers need to fix. Google told CNBC in June that it is working with publishers in a new program called Funding Choices. Under the program, when a user with a third-party ad blocker enabled visits a participating site using Chrome, they will see a prompt that asks them to either turn off their ad blocker, or ""pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor."" If they choose to pay the fee, Google will take a 10 percent cut. If they select neither choice, they won't be able to view the website. Ad blockers are an obvious problem for publishers because if people don't see or click on ads, their sites won't collect revenue. A February report from PageFair said that 615 million devices now use ad blockers worldwide. Some web pages can feel dominated by advertising and the Coalition for Better Ads announced Monday that it is launching a better ads experience program come January.

Jillian D'Onfro,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Google is shutting down Tango, the augmented reality platform it launched in 2014. Tweet On the one hand, the move isn't surprising. Although Tango has been around for years, it never reached mainstream adoption because using its 3D mapping technology required high-tech hardware made specifically to handle it. Meanwhile, Google introduced ARCore, a developer toolkit for creating augmented reality apps and experiences, back in August. ARCore still won't work with any phone, but it will have a much broader reach than Tango. Google said at launch that ARCore will work on up to 100 million devices by the end of the year, and that most Android phones released in 2018 would work with the service too. With ARCore's launch, Tango seemed pretty much dead in the water since the new platform will bring augmented reality to more phones with less hardware. Still, fairly recently Google seemed committed to Tango. The company was still showing off the technology this spring, both at its own developers' conference and Mobile World Congress. Representatives said in May that Google's vision was to see Tango in every smartphone and BMW announced a partnership with Tango at the beginning of the year. Still, ARCore's software development kit is very similar to Tango's, so although the latter is getting sunsetted, it will live on its predecessor, albeit in a more versatile way.

Catherine Clifford,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Google is famous for its ""20 percent time,"" whereby staffers are allowed to spend the equivalent of one workday a week on passion projects that they believe will benefit the company. The idea is that creativity and innovation happen when people are allowed to experiment. Things such as Gmail and Chromebooks have resulted, according to a Google spokesperson. Whether the policy still exists has been debated over the last few years. But on Thursday, Google announced that artificial intelligence researcher and senior software engineer Chris Shallue discovered two new planets — and it was born of a flex-time side venture. One day, it could even help discover alien life. ""I'm a Google AI researcher with an interest in space, and started this work as a 20 percent project,"" writes Shallue in a  statement from Google. He read about the existence of vast quantities of planetary data NASA had collected via its Kepler spacecraft and telescope, which has taken a photo from its orbit every 30 minutes for the last four years, according to Google. Shallue recognized the un-mined information as ripe for an AI experiment. ""Machine learning really shines in situations where there is so much data that humans can't search it for themselves,"" says Shallue in a NASA statement. (The Kepler dataset took two weeks to download and didn't fit on a desktop, according to a Reddit ""ask me anything"" with Shallue.) Shallue recruited Andrew Vanderberg, an astrophysicist and doctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, for help on the project, which took about nine months. Together the pair used 15,000 NASA data points to create a neural network, or artificial intelligence organized in a similar way to neurons in the brain. It learned to recognize small light patterns indicating the existence of a planet that previous automated and manual tests had missed. AI takes on a new mission: planet hunting. See how we used machine learning to hunt for new planets in @NASAKepler data–and actually found one To verify that the neural AI was accurate, Vanderberg used it on a set of photos of 670 stars, then compared that to manually sorted results. What took Vanderberg eight hours to complete took the neural network only a few minutes, the astronomer tells CNBC Make It. Shallue and Vanderberg had taught the system ""how to identify planets around faraway stars,"" says Shallue in the Google statement. The two planets Shallue and Vanderberg discovered are ""exoplanets,"" or planets rotating around sun-like stars other than the one Earth revolves around. Kepler-90i was found to be the eighth planet circling the Kepler-90 star, 2,545 light-years from Earth. The only other solar system known to have eight planets rotating around a sun is our solar system.

""It's like sifting through rocks to find jewels. If you have a finer sieve, then you will catch more rocks but you might catch more jewels, as well."" Beyond discovering new planets, this technological development is a step toward discovering alien life, explains Vanderberg to CNBC Make It. ""The main reason we decided to work on this project was to help us measure how common Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars are,"" Vanderberg tells CNBC Make It. He estimates finding alien life could be possible somewhere between 2030 and 2050.

Jillian D'Onfro,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"As the biggest tech companies fight to invade your living room, Amazon's Echo product line still outsells competitors, like the Google Home,  by a huge margin. But while Amazon is dominating smart speakers, one of Google's hardware products for the home has emerged as a market-leading hit: Its mesh Wi-Fi product. Little over a year after it first went on sale, Google Wifi has become the best selling mesh technology Wi-Fi system in the U.S., according to new data from NPD Group. The retail tracking company based this distinction on unit sales of routers and mesh Wi-Fi systems between December 2016 and November 2017. Using  mesh networking technology, which has become increasingly popular over the last several years, Google Wifi basically serves to make sure your Wi-Fi works consistently well throughout your house or apartment. By arranging access points around your place, you can kill dead-spots and achieve faster internet speeds. ""It's not necessarily sexy, but it's super useful,"" Ben Brown, head of Google Wifi told CNBC. Brown has led the connectivity team through the release of its OnHub router to this latest product. He says that one of the unexpectedly popular use cases that surfaced after Wifi launched was how much people used it to curb their bad digital habits. ""We've been so successful in terms of actual quantity of sales because there are a lot of people that are from a non-traditional segment,"" he says. ""We're not just marketing to tech enthusiasts, for sure — we know that from all of our engagement with customers and usage data. A lot of what's driving people to the product is the ability to be a better parent."" It's turned out to be a key selling point. Google Wifi lets users pause the Wi-Fi access of specific devices for periods of time or  block certain websites. With a few taps in an app, a parent could stop their kids from using their phones during dinner or streaming videos after bedtime. ""[People are] coming to a need they have in the home that has nothing to do with Wi-Fi itself,"" he says. Other mesh Wi-Fi systems,  like Eero and  Luma, have similar features. While Google's product is the top-selling, it hasn't wowed everyone. Although the device received rave reviews from CNET and  others, it earned low marks in  Wirecutter's intense testing of a handful of different mesh-networking kits, ranking poorly in both long-range testing and latency. On Google's main Mountain View campus, the company has Wi-Fi testing chambers where it continually works out ways to improve its connectivity through software tweaks. Ultimately, Brown says that he sees machine learning and artificial intelligence as the secret sauce already making Google's Wifi product such a hit. But one area where Google's product could shine moving forward is through integration with its smart speaker, the Home. The Information reported  earlier this year that Google plans to release a version of Home with mesh Wi-Fi connectivity built in, and although Brown wouldn't go as far as to confirm the report, he conceded that further integrating connectivity and Google's Assistant is something the team is thinking about. As of now, Amazon hasn't released any sort of Wi-Fi product of its own, though it did invest in Luma's Series A in 2016. Regardless of which company a mesh Wi-Fi system comes from, the consumer desire has grown as people are using more smart home products, according to IDC analyst Adam Wright: ""Demand for Wi-Fi mesh networks is also increasing as consumers are connecting more media streaming devices across the home,"" he says.

Jillian D'Onfro,12212017,CNBC,12142017,"Facebook and Google's dominance in online advertising continues to swell. New data suggests that the two tech giants accounted for 73% of all U.S. digital advertising, according to Pivotal's Brian Wieser in a note to clients, up from 63% in the second quarter of 2015. That's a significant leap and highlights why many see digital advertising as a two-pony show, with Facebook and Google taking most of the money while other platforms like Twitter and Snapchat fight publishers for the scraps. In the face of that duopoly, there's also been increasing interest around Amazon's ad business, which is starting to be  taken more seriously by brands. Wieser comes to his estimates by looking at new data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau that shows that digital advertising grew 23% in the second quarter of 2017 to $20.8 billion in ad revenue. Wieser estimates that Facebook and Google account for 83% of that growth. Rather than using the new data to push investors to buy stock, Wieser recommends caution because he believes that the we're approaching the saturation point when increases in digital ad budgets won't lead to increased sales. ""Growth rates are remarkable, but also highlight risks around digital media owners – and Facebook and Google in particular – saturating digital media budgets in years ahead, and reinforce our cautious views on stocks in the sector at current levels,"" he writes. That's why Facebook in particular has ""become more aggressive in finding ways to capture television advertising budgets,"" like with its new ""Watch"" video offering.

""And so if there's going to be mistakes on that and you're noticing sloppiness on there, that really is a great indicator of how they'll perform in a job.""

Hayes says there are certain errors you must always look out for: An HR person who sees any of this on a resume will think ""that is just a reflection of how they will be as an employee at the company,"" says Haynes. ""The resume is something that you have to absolutely nail if you want an interview."" The senior recruiter admits that you would be surprised at how often she sees mistakes on resumes and just overall poor resume quality. ""I've seen it all,"" she says in the podcast.

Since 2010, the company's stock has appreciated 2000 percent, reports The Motley Fool, in that time frame outperforming the tech giants Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The Motley Fool's data extends to April 2017, when the value of Domino's stock was $180. Notably, that's lower than it's December value of $185 a share at the time of publication. President and CEO Patrick Doyle turned the chain around so successfully, for one, by heeding the public's criticisms and making better pizza. But, more importantly, he invigorated focus on digital innovation and amped up their delivery service. Domino's now employs more people in their IT department than anywhere else in the company, reports CBS News, and over half of their sales come from digital platforms. ""With Domino's AnyWare, pizza can now be ordered through a variety of platforms, including Google Home, Amazon's Echo, Facebook Messenger, a smart TV, an Apple or Android smartwatch, a connected car, by texting, or by tweeting,"" notes The Motley Fool. They've literally made ordering a pizza as simple as tweeting out a pizza emoji. If that wasn't enough, Domino's also managed to recently land the long-haired ""Stranger Things"" stud Joe Keery as a spokesperson. He's featured in a commercial recreating the running home-scene in the '80s hit ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Only, in this case, Keery isn't trying to beat his parents home. He is trying to beat the pizza he is tracking on his phone, because you can also do that now. Domino's stock has demonstrated consistent growth for years, and Doyle is continuously looking for opportunity to grow further, he told the Los Angeles Times, even if it means taking risks, such as when they added voice ordering to their app three years ago.

It seems we see almost daily news stories about artificial intelligence (AI) and innovations that are being realized as the result of this technology. While terms like ""groundbreaking"" are typically the result of hype and hyperbole, the developments in the area of deep learning are certainly worthy of the term. Researchers at Verily, the life sciences division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), in collaboration with the Google Brain team, another subsidiary that leads the company's pioneering AI efforts, have applied deep learning to the solving of the human genome -- with encouraging results. In a research blog published last week, the scientists announced the release of a new open-source AI system called DeepVariant, which is capable of assembling a more complete rendering of the human genome. Google is using AI to provide a more accurate picture for genetic sequencing. Image source: Getty Images. The science of deep learning involves the creation of artificial neural networks, computer models based on the structure and function of the human brain, which attempts to recreate our ability to learn. The system is fed massive amounts of data and controlled by complex algorithms, and can then recognize patterns from the data. It can make associations and distinguish differences from those patterns, which results in the ability to draw conclusions and make predictions based on the information. The process of high-throughput sequencing has been around for more than a decade, which made genome sequencing more widely available, but the enormous amount data was complex and the process of understanding it was prone to error. More recent developments have been used to fill in some of the gaps, but still left an incomplete and faulty picture. By applying deep learning to the process, the researchers were able to avoid the pitfalls and some of the errors that resulted from previous methods, and created more precise results. According to the scientists, deep learning provided ""significantly greater accuracy than previous classical methods."" In coming years, these results could help scientists develop more targeted treatments for a variety of complex diseases and genetic abnormalities. The DeepVariant system took one of the top prizes last year in a contest sponsored by the FDA designed to promote improvements in gene sequencing. This isn't the first time Verily and Google Brain researchers have applied AI to improve healthcare results. Early detection of breast cancer significantly increases the chances for successful treatment. Earlier this year, the researchers created a neural network for the purpose of screening medical images for tumors. The team reported that the system achieved a greater degree of accuracy than human pathologists assigned the same task. GoogLeNet AI was fed thousands of medical images and scored an 89% accuracy rate compared to 73% for pathologists. The team used a similar process to examine images of the retina in order to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the leading causes of blindness resulting from diabetes. In reviewing eye scans, the Google Brain exceeded the standards for accuracy and precision for successfully detecting the condition required by the National Institutes of Health. These results were all the more important in light of the shortage of qualified ophthalmologists for diagnosing the condition. Scientists have only just begun to tap the enormous potential that could result from AI. The preceding examples represent the tip of the iceberg of what may be possible when applying deep learning to the area of healthcare. They do illustrate, however, the ways in which AI can provide a new approach to many existing health problems. Expect new and greater advances as researchers come up with new and more innovative ways to solve problems using AI. ","

Self-driving cars weren't even on the horizon a little more than a decade ago, but now it seems that every major automaker and the biggest firms in Silicon Valley are hot on the trail of driverless cars. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), is widely considered the front-runner in autonomous driving. Waymo has compiled more than 3.5 million miles driven on the highways and byways of the U.S. The company embarked on an early rider program in early 2017, shuttling consumers around the Phoenix metro area to gauge public reaction to the technology. The company recently removed the backup drivers from the vehicles, making them truly autonomous. Now, Google has partnered with Rolls-Royce (NASDAQOTH:RYCEY) to use its pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) to bring self-piloting capability to ships at sea. Ships could soon be piloting themselves, thanks to Google AI. Image source: Getty Images. The initial work will be done by the deep-learning neural networks that Google currently uses for image recognition. Rolls-Royce will use Google's Cloud Machine Learning Engine, and the system will be fine-tuned ""for detecting, identifying and tracking the objects a vessel can encounter at sea."" This will help make current vessels more efficient and increase safety for the crews who operate them. Ships currently use a number of traditional technologies like radar and automatic identification system (AIS) to detect other vessels in the water and for collision avoidance. AIS is a tracking system used to determine the identification and specific information for ships, by using radio frequencies and GPS transmitters linked to satellites. Smaller vessels won't necessarily have these sophisticated technologies, so crew members keep watch for these and other water-borne hazards. By positioning cameras, sensors, and scanners around the vessel, it can be outfitted with 360-degree computer vision. This would enable an AI system to fuse the resulting data with information from a variety of other shipboard instrumentation including radar and AIS, potentially relieving the crew of this responsibility. Since there is far less oceangoing traffic, fewer obstacles, and more straight line of travel, you might be tempted to assume that a self-piloting ship would be easier to engineer than an autonomous car. Karno Tenovuo, the senior vice president for ship intelligence for Rolls-Royce, explained that this isn't the case: A typical car AI aims to replace one human -- the driver -- whereas a typical cargo ship has over 20 crew members, and you need to cover all of the jobs they would do on a vessel. In a lot of ways the complexity can be greater than what an automobile has to deal with. It would also be necessary for an autonomous ship to control cargo handling, security, and other shipboard systems. Rolls-Royce heads the Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Applications Initiative (AAWA), a project that enlists the aid of leading universities, shipbuilders, equipment manufacturers, and classification societies to explore the many factors that would need to be addressed before self-piloting ships can take to the high seas. The AAWA released a report that sets the stage for further research, by identifying three key areas for development -- sensor fusion, control algorithms, and communication and connectivity. This will be the starting point for its partnership with Google and the some of the goals for training its AI. Rolls-Royce believes that the first of these ships with reduced crews and remote support will be in operation by 2020, and fully unmanned oceangoing ships could launch by 2035. The greatest benefits gained would be safety and efficiency. Human error, fatigue in particular, is responsible for between 75% and 96% of all marine accidents, according to a report published by insurance company Allianz. Rolls-Royce also estimates that autonomous shipping could reduce shipping costs by as much as 22%. ","

Adam Levy,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Our digital lives are dominated by a handful of companies. Among the most dominant are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). All three stocks have posted excellent returns in 2017, and all three are well positioned to continue outpacing the broader market. But if investors had to choose just one of these three stellar companies, which should they choose? Image source: Google. Google controls a massive share of the global internet search market. Google consistently takes over 90% of global search traffic. Those searches not only provide high-value advertising space, but also provide great ad-targeting data for use across Google's portfolio of apps including YouTube, GMail, and Maps -- all of which have over 1 billion users. YouTube, in particular, presents a massive opportunity for Google. The video service boasts over 1.5 billion logged-in users streaming an average of over one hour of video on mobile devices alone. As advertisers look to shift spending from traditional TV to digital media, YouTube presents the best analog to television advertising. The continued growth of YouTube and internet-connected devices in general resulted in Google posting a 21% year-over-year increase in ad revenue last quarter. Average ad prices continue to fall year over year as users spend more time on mobile and more new users come from emerging markets with lower average ad prices. That said, Google showed some signs of stabilization as average ad prices increased sequentially. With so much ad inventory and such great targeting data, Google has become a dominant force in advertising. As digital ad spending overtakes television advertising, Google is a prime beneficiary. The company also continues to take moonshots, mostly under the Alphabet umbrella. Those offer tremendous upside, but their size relative to Google results in minimal negative impact on the operations of the company in the near term. Image source: Facebook. But buyer beware. Facebook is facing an expected slowdown starting in the second half of this year as it bumps up against ad load saturation on its flagship product. Last quarter, Facebook managed just 49% advertising revenue growth. It would be great if all revenue growth slowdowns looked like Facebook's. Facebook is managing to increase average ad prices even as the growth in ad impressions stagnates. It's pushing more into video advertising, and recently launched Watch to compete more directly with YouTube. It's also quickly growing advertising on Instagram as it works to develop a long-term monetization strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook has a few moonshots of its own, including a big investment in virtual reality with its Oculus operations. The company is at the forefront of VR technology, so if it really is the next big computing platform as CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicts, Facebook will play an even bigger role in our lives next decade. Image source: Amazon. Amazon is much more than a retail company these days. In fact, most of its profits stem from its cloud computing services division, Amazon Web Services. One could argue Amazon is more of a services business than a retailer. From cloud computing, to its marketplace, to streaming video and music, Amazon has a plethora of services available to customers. Amazon Prime is the glue that holds nearly all of its services together. Prime is the reason why more than half of all product searches on the internet start on Amazon.com. It's the reason shoppers will opt to buy something from Amazon rather than a competitor, all else being equal (or just close to equal). It's the reason more and more third-party merchants want space in Amazon's warehouses for its Fulfillment by Amazon program. It's the reason Amazon can produce original content, show its movies in theaters, and offer a subscription streaming service in parts of the world where Prime isn't available. There are 90 million U.S. households with a Prime subscription, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime's success has led to continual growth for Amazon. Last quarter, sales increased 34%. While Amazon continues to plow cash back into the business, its top-line growth results appear to be paying off. Comparing Alphabet and Facebook is relatively easy, as both companies have similar operations. But Amazon presents a big challenge, as it doesn't really have any peers that can compare. Let's do the easy comparison first. On an EV/EBITDA basis, Alphabet offers a significant discount to Facebook. Shares of Alphabet trade hands at a 19.7 times multiple versus a 23.9 times multiple for Facebook. With similar profit growth outlooks longnterm (considering they each benefit from the exact same secular trends), Alphabet shares appear to be the better buy at this time compared to Facebook. But Amazon may present an even better opportunity. Its valuation is certainly off the charts with an EV/EBITDA ratio more than twice as high as Alphabet's, but it presents significant growth opportunities as it expands Prime into more countries, moves its retail operations into more verticals, and looks for new services to support its own business as well as new customers. Investing in Amazon certainly requires faith in management to execute on an extremely long-term playbook. Investors who just want to maximize their returns on a megatrend in advertising would do well with Alphabet shares. As I said, all three companies present great opportunities. ","

Artificial intelligence (AI) is creating a lot of excitement in technology circles, and every Silicon Valley company worth its salt is looking to use this emerging science to solve real-world problems. Google, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), was one of the pioneers of the AI technique known as deep learning. Software models based on how neurons in the human brain work, called neural networks, attempt to re-create our ability to learn. By processing massive amounts of data, these systems begin to recognize patterns and detect differences. These models can then be applied to a variety of tasks. Now, researchers from Google and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have revealed that, by using deep learning to analyze data from its Kepler Space Telescope, they've discovered previously unidentified planets in a distant solar system. Google AI discovered a previously undiscovered planet using a neural network. Image source: NASA. The Kepler Space Telescope, which launched in 2009, is a floating observatory that was designed to search for planets orbiting around a star. It looks for the transit -- the ever-so-slight change in brightness that occurs when a planet passes in front of its host star. This isn't something visible to the naked eye, but by taking careful and exacting measurements of the light a star emits over time, the system can detect the slight variations that occur when the orbit of a planet passes in front of the star. The larger the obstruction, the greater the amount of light blocked, allowing scientists to estimate the size of these planets from the changes in light readings. Using a neural network Google designed, NASA researchers trained the system to identify exoplanets, a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. The AI was taught to look for changes in the light readings, or signals, which would indicate the presence of a planet in orbit. The system was trained ""using a set of 15,000 previously vetted signals"" from the data Kepler sent. Once the training was completed, the neural network was able to correctly identify planets and false positives with 96% accuracy. A newly discovered planet was found orbiting Kepler-90, a ""Sun-like star 2,545 light-years from Earth"" found in the constellation Draco. The planet, now dubbed Kepler-90i, is ""a sizzling hot, rocky planet that orbits its star once every 14.4 days."" This is the eighth planet found orbiting Kepler-90, which now ties our own solar system for the number of planets orbiting a single star. ""The Kepler-90 star system is like a mini-version of our solar system. You have small planets inside and big planets outside, but everything is scrunched in much closer,"" said Vanderburg, a NASA Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow and astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin. The four years of Kepler data contains 35,000 potential signals indicating planets. Human observers and automated tests are used to verify the exoplanet data, but the weakest signals often go unrecognized. This is but another example of the technological breakthroughs that are possible as the result of AI. Not all of them will come with a financial benefit, but they will allow us to boldly go where no one has gone before. ","

Few businesses are as dominant in their respective industries as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google. Amazon dominates e-commerce in the U.S. and many other areas of the world, while Google is the unquestioned leader in global internet search. As these companies have risen to power, they've earned a fortune for their investors along the way. But which is the better buy today? Let's find out. Amazon and Google are ferocious competitors. We square them off to see which of these industry kings is the best choice for your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Google and Amazon are both powerhouse businesses, but let's look at some key metrics to see if either one has an edge when it comes to financial strength. Also, please note that Google reorganized itself as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) in 2015, so we'll use Alphabet's figures from this point forward. Metric Amazon Alphabet Revenue $161.2 billion $104.6 billion EBITDA $14.0 billion $32.7 billion Operating income $3.2 billion $25.1 billion Net income $1.9 billion $21.0 billion Operating cash flow $16.2 billion $36.2 billion Free cash flow $7.2 billion $24.3 billion Cash $24.3 billion $100.1 billion Debt $24.7 billion $4.0 billion DATA SOURCE: MORNINGSTAR. Many businesses would love to have Amazon's $16 billion in annual operating cash flow. Yet Alphabet's cash production is even more remarkable, coming in at greater than twice that of Amazon at $36.2 billion. Moreover, the search titan has a staggering $96 billion in net cash on its fortress-like balance sheet, while Amazon has slightly more debt than cash. So in terms of financial strength, Alphabet earns top marks. Alphabet may have the edge when it comes to financial fortitude, but Amazon is the clear leader in terms of revenue growth in recent years. AMZN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Wall Street expects this trend to continue, with analysts forecasting that Amazon's revenue will surge by 29% in 2018, fueled by the torrid growth of Amazon Web Services, the relentless expansion of its e-commerce operations, and the positive impact of its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. During this same time, Alphabet's revenue is projected to increase 19%, driven by the continued robust performance of YouTube and mobile search. For businesses this size -- Amazon and Alphabet's market caps currently check in at $570 billion and $740 billion, respectively -- these growth rates are impressive. But with its significantly higher expected revenue growth, Amazon has the edge here. No better-buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's check out some key value metrics for Amazon and Alphabet, including price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. Metric Amazon Alphabet (Class A Shares) Trailing P/E 300.65 35.83 Forward P/E 146.84 25.79 P/FCF 78.69 30.45 DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE, MORNINGSTAR. On all three metrics, Alphabet's stock is considerably less expensive than Amazon's, making the search king the better bargain. Amazon and Alphabet are both high-quality businesses that are likely to continue to reward investors in the years ahead. But with its superior financial strength and more attractively priced stock, Alphabet is the better buy today. ","

Alibaba is primarily known for its Tmall and Taobao e-commerce marketplaces, but the company is also trying to expand its cloud services ecosystem against Tencent, which dominates the country's social media market with WeChat, and Baidu, China's top internet search provider. Streaming video remains unprofitable for all three companies due to high expenses and competition hampering their ability to raise prices, but it's still a lucrative way to tether users to their ecosystems. Moreover, JP Morgan believes that these players should approach profitability by 2019 as they pivot from ad-supported business models toward subscription-based ones. Its report estimates that the number of paid video subscribers in China could rise from about 60 million today to 234 million by 2020. Youku's mobile app. Image source: Google Play. Youku already hosts about 1.18 billion daily video views across 580 million devices. It hosts lots of domestic content, as well as overseas content, via partnerships with Disney, Time Warner, Viacom's Paramount, and other top studios. The new deals with NBCUniversal and Sony will further expand that portfolio. However, Tencent Video and iQiyi also hold similar deals with many of those companies, so Youku is merely keeping pace instead of landing any exclusive blows. Alibaba Pictures complements the company's Digital Media and Entertainment group, which includes Tmall TV, Alibaba Music, the UC Browser, its events ticket vendor Damai.cn, and its Alitrip online travel agency. However, that business remains deeply unprofitable, with an adjusted EBITA margin of negative 36% last quarter. China has a massive total addressable market for online video, and it will likely eclipse the US as the world's largest film market within two years. This means that media giants like NBCUniversal and Sony need to stake their claims to the market as it matures. Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent are all aggressively expanding into adjacent markets like online video, which could either win over more users or weigh down their margins. Looking ahead, investors should expect more partnerships between Hollywood film studios and Chinese tech companies as China's online video and film markets grow. ","
      
    Alibaba Teams Up with Two Media Giants -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It should be no surprise that the top two companies in digital video advertising are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. What might be surprising is that Facebook generates much more video ad revenue than Google, which owns YouTube. Facebook captures over 39% of digital video ad spending compared to 27% for YouTube, according to a survey of U.S. senior marketers conducted by Brand Innovators and Innovid. Facebook's video efforts are relatively nascent. It started autoplaying videos in the news feed in 2014, and video views grew quickly. Its most recent effort, Watch, is still finding its footing as it attempts to take on YouTube. The fact that Facebook already has stellar demand for video advertising should help it resolve some of the issues facing Watch and continue growing ad revenue. Image source: Facebook. Watch hasn't gained the traction right out of the gate that Facebook was likely hoping for. Users are largely uninterested in the dedicated video section of the app, with 8 in 10 users rarely opening the section if ever, according to a survey from RBC Capital Markets. What's more, users that do visit Watch don't spend a lot of time watching videos. The average watch time is just 23 seconds. That's actually higher than within News Feed, but users are supposed to be visiting Watch with the intention of watching longer-form videos. That poor engagement has led to some discontent among content creators. Facebook currently pays for a lot of content upfront, but it plans to shift to a revenue share model similar to YouTube in the future. Content publishers say the midroll ad breaks within Watch aren't producing much revenue at all. These are problems Facebook is taking steps to fix. It just introduced pre-roll advertisements, a move it long resisted as it disrupted the flow of News Feed. Pre-roll ads make a lot more sense in a format like Watch, which is similar to YouTube. Facebook is also starting to push more longer-form serialized videos within News Feed. If Facebook can increase the awareness of content available on Watch, perhaps it can increase engagement. With just 20% of users visiting the section, there's a lot of room for improvement. The good news for publishers is that Facebook is already the No. 1 source for video advertisers. What's more, Facebook's third-quarter results indicate those advertisers are willing to pay up for ad space on Facebook. Demand is outpacing supply at this point. It's just a matter of getting users to engage with Watch, and ad revenue will surely follow. Facebook also stands to benefit in a shift of ad budgets from television to digital. YouTube has certainly been a big beneficiary, as digital video serves as an excellent analog for television ads. Watch, as an up-and-coming platform, could exhibit significantly faster growth than the more mature YouTube going forward thanks to the secular shift. For investors, there's relatively small downside for Watch. If users begin seeing it as a longer-form video destination, Facebook has the demand to fill ad inventory. That means it can quickly transition to a revenue-share model where it doesn't have to make big capital outlays to attract content creators. The downside is that users never see Watch as a destination for videos, and Facebook quickly shutters the platform in favor of the next project. Facebook Watch isn't off to a great start, but Facebook's dominance of video advertising means that it has a very good chance of becoming a success. Products like Watch might not always work out for Facebook, but the upside is far greater than the downside, making it a risk worth taking. ","
      
    Facebook Already Dominates Online Video Ads -- The Motley Fool

Sean Williams,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Traditionally, mid-December is the time of the year when investors reflect on how well, or poorly, the stock market treated them during the year. But that's not the case this year. In 2017, all eyes are seemingly fixed on soaring cryptocurrencies valuations. Since the year began, the aggregate value of all digital currencies combined has catapulted from $17.7 billion to $519 billion, a more than 2,800% increase. Mind you, it has taken the broad-based S&P 500 decades to deliver similar returns. Not surprisingly, these gains have left both novice and experienced investors awestruck, and in many cases, itching to jump into cryptocurrencies. Image source: Getty Images. You might be asking yourself, what's the buzz behind virtual currencies? While the answer is complex and involves a confluence of factors, most tie back to what's arguably the biggest catalyst of all: blockchain technology. Blockchain is the digital and decentralized ledger that underlies most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC), the world's most popular virtual currency. It's responsible for recording all transactions, and does so without the need for a financial intermediary, like a bank. Most pundits believe blockchain technology could be worth billions because of the advantages it brings to the table over the current means of money transmittance. For starters, and as noted, blockchain is a decentralized technology. This means it has no central data hub that cybercriminals can attack with the hope of crippling an entire cryptocurrency. Instead, data is distributed on this ledger throughout the world. While this doesn't make a blockchain impervious to cyberattacks, it does mean that a cyberattack has virtually no chance of bringing a cryptocurrency to its knees. Aside from security improvements, there are cost reductions expected, too. Because there's no third party to act as the intermediary during a transaction, there are fewer mouths to feed (i.e., pay). Lower transaction costs could be a means to higher margins for financial-services companies, or perhaps a pathway to cheaper ancillary fees involving transactions for the consumer. But the biggest upgrade might just be transaction settlement times, especially involving cross-border transactions. Banks are only open during normal business hours for five or six days a week, and cross-border transactions often get held for days at a time. With blockchain, miners are busy proofing transactions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, meaning there's the potential for quick, or even instantaneous, transactions. Image source: Getty Images. Though most blockchain development is happening in the cryptocurrency space with start-up companies, there are some high-profile publicly traded stocks that are investing heavily in the development of blockchain technology. According to data from CB Insights, the following three stocks have the most invested in this burgeoning technology over the past five years. The biggest investor in blockchain over the past half-decade has been Japan's SBI Holdings (NASDAQOTH:SBHGF), with eight direct investments noted by CB Insights. Last year, SBI Holdings, the financial-services division of SBI Group, invested in bitFlyer, a Japan-based bitcoin exchange. Aside from bitcoin trading, bitFlyer was also known for its blockchain applications, which is what appears to have attracted SBI Holdings. More recently, aside from working on its own blockchain technology, the company has partnered with Ripple -- yes, the same Ripple that's doubled in value over the past week. In September, SBI announced that it'd be testing Ripple's cross-border blockchain technology as a means to transfer money between Japanese and South Korean banks. If this sounds familiar, it's because Ripple also landed a partnership to send cross-border payments on American Express's FX International Payment network to Banco Santander accounts in the U.K. this past November. In late October, SBI Holdings immersed itself in the crypto-universe even further when it announced that it would begin acquiring and mining cryptocurrencies to solve problems within the crypto marketplace, and to gather ""systemic knowledge"" of blockchain technologies. The company specifically listed its interest in mining bitcoin and bitcoin cash, as well as investing into U.S. Ripple. Image source: Getty Images. Internet search giant Google, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), is second in terms of aggregate blockchain investments over the past five years, with six investments on record. For instance, blockchain-based enterprise storage-solutions company Storj raised $3 million in seed funding this past February, with Google Ventures being among its major contributors. What's really notable about this funding, aside from the fact that it was the first non-token cash raise for Storj, is that it focuses on non-financial applications and use cases. According to Coindesk, Storj's technology allows an open network of users to provide data hosting to clients via a blockchain. Storj then sells this service to content providers. Just two weeks after its investment in Storj, Alphabet's Google Ventures played a key role in the $24 million raised by Veem, which is building blockchain technology to provide quicker and cheaper remittance services for small- and medium-sized businesses. Those aforementioned lower transaction costs tied to blockchain could be key in putting small- and medium-sized businesses on a more level playing field with big businesses. Image source: Getty Images. The third most-active investor in blockchain technology in recent years is online home-goods retailer Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK). Of the three, this is probably the least surprising of all, especially with CEO Patrick Byrne considering a divestiture of online retail operations in favor of focusing solely on blockchain development. In particular, Medici Ventures, a subsidiary of Overstock, is currently working on the Medici t0 blockchain. This project, which has thus far cost Overstock quite a pretty penny, is designed to develop a blockchain-based securities lending system that'll go head to head with Wall Street, and most likely do so for a lower cost. Just this past week, Overstock also announced a new joint venture between CEO Byrne and economist Hernando de Soto to build a blockchain-based global registry system that's designed to improve property rights in the developing world. The entire reason Byrne has hired Guggenheim Partners to explore a sale of Overstock's retail business is to generate funding for this joint venture. We're bound to see new players enter the blockchain arena in the months and years to come, but for the time being, these three stocks are worth paying attention to. ","
      
    3 Stocks Investing the Most Money in Blockchain  -- The Motley Fool

Keith Speights,12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. You can't have a conversation about investing in artificial intelligence (AI) without having companies like Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) come up. That's for good reason, since those two stocks rank among the top AI stocks on the market. But AI investing isn't limited to Alphabet and NVIDIA or other big companies frequently mentioned. I suspect that many investors are overlooking other promising stocks poised to profit from AI. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Yext (NYSE:YEXT) are three stocks that should also benefit significantly from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images. Top AI approaches such as machine learning and deep learning involve processing huge amounts of data. That data processing requires a lot of memory. Micron Technology ranks as one of the global leaders in providing the kind of memory chips in the highest demand for AI. NVIDIA has been using Micron's memory chips for a while now. The company's technology innovations announced this year have deepened its relationship with the AI leader. Micron's innovations have also positioned it to grow revenue as AI-powered autonomous cars hit the market over the coming years. In September, the company introduced new memory chips that provide a foundation for next-generation autonomous vehicles. Micron also announced that it was partnering with leading automotive partners and customers to develop more high-bandwidth memory technology to power fully autonomous vehicles. While Micron hasn't received the attention from AI investors that NVIDIA has, neither has it been ignored. The stock is up over 90% year to date. Unlike NVIDIA, though, Micron isn't valued at nosebleed levels. Micron shares trade at only six times expected earnings despite the huge gain so far in 2017. Many investors focus largely on companies that provide the hardware used for AI. However, there are also great software picks. In my view, Salesforce.com is one of the best AI-related software stocks. AI is so important for Salesforce that executives stated on the company's third-quarter conference call in November that it's the key for how the company will hold on to its leadership position in the customer relationship management (CRM) market. Salesforce launched its Einstein AI integration in 2016 and added new capabilities this year. Einstein weaves AI throughout Salesforce's core CRM platform. What does Einstein do? A lot. It uses data mining and machine learning to forecast future sales performance. It informs sales staff when a competitor shows up in the news. It uses AI to identify which deals are most likely to close. It uses natural language processing to pick out the most important emails in sales staff's inbox, and even suggests a response. And there's more. You're not going to get a bargain with Salesforce, though. The stock trades at nearly 60 times expected earnings. But I wouldn't be overly concerned about that sky-high multiple. Salesforce has been even more expensive in the past without holding back its stock performance. The least-known of these AI stocks that you might have overlooked is Yext. It's possible that you haven't even heard of Yext, since the company only held its initial public offering in April. However, Yext could be one of the best up-and-coming AI stocks around. Yext's key product is a knowledge engine platform that lets businesses manage their digital knowledge in the cloud and sync that knowledge to over 100 services, including Bing, Cortana, Google, Google Maps, and Siri. The company calls this ""digital knowledge management"" and touts its ability to enable businesses to facilitate face-to-face and digital interactions with customers that boost brand awareness and lead to higher sales. Yext's customer base includes a long list of banks, hotels, retailers, and other companies -- many of which are household names. It's been an up-and-down year for Yext stock since the company's IPO. Shares are now down nearly 10% but could probably bounce right back anytime. Although Yext isn't profitable yet, the company made over $44 million in revenue in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of nearly 39%. Which of these AI stocks is the best pick for investors? Since it's the smallest of the group, Yext probably has the greatest upward potential. However, it also comes with the most risk. Salesforce is the biggest of the three, with a market cap of $75 billion. Despite its steep valuation, I expect the stock will keep going higher in 2018. I think the best pick, though, is Micron. The company is definitely set to profit from growth in use of AI. It's joined at the hip in some respects with NVIDIA. And the stock is cheap. Factoring in growth prospects, it's dirt cheap. If you could only buy one of these stocks, I'd recommend Micron. ","

"Evan Niu, CFA",12212017,Fool,12142017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced today that it is cracking down on ""engagement bait,"" which is when a post specifically calls for users to act on posts through actions such as liking, commenting, or sharing. Most Facebook users have surely seen these types of posts, and the company believes they exploit Facebook's News Feed algorithm, which in part measures relevance by looking at engagement. Facebook will start demoting posts from people and Pages that use engagement bait to get broader exposure to their content. The company would prefer that users participate in ""authentic engagement"" instead of being coaxed to engage in certain posts. Image source: Facebook. The social network says it has reviewed hundreds of thousands of posts that it then fed into its machine learning model in order to detect engagement bait, and these posts will start to be demoted in the News Feed and subsequently reach fewer people. Pages in particular will see stricter demotions if they're serial offenders and ""repeatedly use engagement bait to artificially gain reach."" Facebook will give Pages a few weeks to adapt and ""avoid inadvertently using engagement bait in their posts."" However, soliciting help, advice, or recommendations from friends and family will not be penalized, which includes things like sharing a missing child report or fundraising for a cause, among others. The company says it the change is part of its pursuit of authenticity, which includes its announcement from May that it would be similarly demoting clickbait headlines. The broader context is that Facebook has been widely criticized for its role in inadvertently spreading fake news during the 2016 election cycle, which was exacerbated by its relevance algorithms promoting inaccurate but viral political content. Facebook wants to ""reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading."" Tech companies, including Facebook, also spread misinformation in the wake of the recent Las Vegas shooting due to their algorithms, further underscoring how powerful these algorithms have become. Over the years, various hoaxes have spread over social media, often driven by this type of engagement bait. In at least a few instances, users were told that Facebook was preparing to implement a monthly service fee, but that sharing the post would somehow allow them to avoid having to pay the fee. The language on Facebook's greeting page to new users that proclaims the service is ""free and always will be"" was in part a response to these recurring hoaxes. Giveaway scams, which promise valuable prizes like cars or gadgets if a user comments or shares, are also on the rise. It's not clear why Facebook's referrals have declined relative to Google's, but Facebook continuously tweaks its News Feed algorithms. Much like Google's search algorithms, many companies rely heavily on Facebook's social algorithms. Facebook started granting higher priority to social content from friends and family over publisher content last year, and began experimenting with segregating these content categories completely in select markets a couple months ago. If Facebook's relative decline in referral traffic in recent months is the product of algorithm changes, that could potentially hurt the ad business. Referral traffic and ad spending are intimately linked. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg made clear in a statement in the last earnings release that it would be worth the financial sacrifice: We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits. ","

    Wochit Dave Brandon, chief executive officer of Toys R Us Inc., speaks during an interview at a Toys R Us Inc. store in Secaucus in August.(Photo: Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg) The decision by Toys R Us to file for bankruptcy in September affected fall shipments and sales and many have scared off holiday shoppers, the company said Thursday in a conference call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results. The company experienced ""significant interruption"" in shipments during the quarter, particularly in October, Toys R Us Chairman and CEO Dave Brandon said. The quarter included a time period that ""was pretty stressful, pretty difficult and certainly had a negative impact on the business,""  Brandon said. Brandon faced questions on the call about possible store closings, the ongoing viability of the company, and advisory fees paid to the companies that sponsored the leveraged buyout of Toys R Us in 2005. Store closing decisions are ""a work in progress"" at this time, Brandon said, and any reports that large numbers of stores will close are ""pure conjecture at this point."" Surveys by the company found that 50% of Americans were aware that Toys R Us had filed for bankruptcy and that 17% said the bankruptcy would impact their shopping decisions, Brandon said.

Toys R Us, he said, decided to stick with its more general campaign rather than target those who were worried about bankruptcy, and perhaps end up making more shoppers aware of the bankruptcy. Brandon was asked by analysts during the conference call whether the company was planning store closings in 2018, but would not comment on real estate decisions. In January, after the crucial holiday period has passed, Toys R Us will be releasing more details about its plans to transform and revitalize the company, Brandon said. One of the new Play Labs at the Times Square store in Manhattan. (Photo: Staff) Brandon said its Babies R Us business has been challenged by price competition, particularly online, along with weakness in its toy business. For the third quarter, net sales declined by $89 million, to $2.1 billion. Consolidated same-store sales, which measure sales at stores open at least a year, declined by 4.4%. Sales at U.S. stores were down 7% compared to with the third quarter of 2016, while sales at international stores were up 0.4%, as a result of growth in Asia. Net loss widened to $624 million, from a loss of $160 million in the previous third quarter. Operating loss grew to $208 million from $40 million. Toys R Us recorded $334 million of net items related to the bankruptcy proceeding during the third quarter. Toys R Us creditors have won permission from the Bankruptcy Court to move forward with a deeper investigation into the company's debt transactions before filing for bankruptcy, and fees involved in the leveraged buyout. Brandon, in response to a question on the conference call, said fees to the leveraged buyout partners were part of the original buyout agreement and that they have been reduced and eliminated in recent years. Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail and investment banking firm headquartered in New York City, said Toys R Us' problems are rooted in the leveraged buyout, which created unsustainable debt, and that they have been compounded by mismanagement, including a badly timed bankruptcy filing. But the main insurmountable problem, Davidowitz said, is the debt. ""We are in a period of unprecedented change in retailing and debt is not your friend,"" he said.

Russell Gold,12212017,MarketWatch,12142017,"Published: Dec 14, 2017 9:12 a.m. ET University researchers examined 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania between 2004 and 2013 By Babies born to women who live close to fracked natural gas wells have an elevated risk of being born with a low birth weight, according to a study published Wednesday. The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, are part of an emerging body of research suggesting that the industrialization of areas due to oil and gas exploration is having negative health impacts on neighboring residents. Similar studies have linked living near freeway toll plazas and industrial plants with lower birth weights. That research underscores a problem that has bedeviled the industry and regulators: While the benefits of hydraulic fracturing are widespread, the costs are very localized. The drilling and completion technologies commonly known as fracking have turned the U.S. into an energy superpower while lowering both energy prices and carbon dioxide emissions. To accommodate the industry’s rapid growth over the past decade, several regions of the country—including parts of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas and North Dakota—have been turned into industrialized zones, sometimes overlapping with communities. Researchers at the University of Chicago, Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, examined more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania between 2004 and 2013, when breakthroughs in fracking turned the state into a major producer of natural gas. Thousands of wells were drilled and fracked in the state over that span, according to federal data. The study found that the babies of women who lived within a kilometer of a well suffer from poorer health and have lower birth weights, while babies born more than three kilometers away show no apparent health impacts.

Max Jaeger,12212017,MarketWatch,12142017,"Published: Dec 18, 2017 9:25 a.m. ET Tennessee Republican said he doesn’t ‘know what the provision does’ By Holdout Republican Sen. Bob Corker finally announced he would support the Republican tax bill in an upcoming vote — after the proposal was tweaked in a way that could personally enrich him. Corker claims he has not read the mammoth bill being sped through the legislature and has no idea how the language, which was not in previous Senate versions of the bill, got into the plan. The provision reduces taxes on income from real-estate LLCs, according to International Business Times, which broke the story. Corker, a South Carolina real-estate mogul, made $7 million off such income last year, while President Trump raked in between $41 million and $68 million, according to the outlet. The House and Senate are reconciling disparate versions of the bill they separately passed before putting the final product on President Trump’s desk for a signature. Neither previous version included the real-estate tax carve-out when first passed, IBT reported. Corker, a Republican who opposed an earlier version of the $1.4 trillion bill because it will increase the deficit, pleaded ignorance when asked why he changed his mind after the tax carve-out measure was tossed in. “I don’t really know what the provision does to be honest. I would need an accountant to explain it,” Corker told IBT, saying he only read a “two-page summary” of the 500-plus-page document released on Friday. He sent a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch on Sunday asking the chairman to “provide an explanation” how the measure ended up in the final bill.

 ,12212017,MarketWatch,12142017,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump criticized Russia Friday for not doing enough to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. “China is helping, Russia is not helping. We would like to have Russia’s help,” he told reporters outside the White House. Trump said he had mainly discussed the North Korea issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call yesterday. “He said very nice things about what I have done for the country in terms of the economy, and he said also some negative things in terms of what is going on elsewhere.” “But the primary point was to talk about North Korea, because we would love to have his help on North Korea.” On Friday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is to address the UN Security Council how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear weapons and long-range missile tests.

Nathan Hodge,12212017,MarketWatch,12142017,"Published: Dec 14, 2017 6:29 p.m. ET Putin recently declared his candidacy for a fourth and final presidential term By MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin played the statesman in his annual press conference Thursday, offering praise for President Donald Trump while offering few specific solutions to the country’s domestic problems. Putin’s year-end press conferences have become a political ritual that dominates the airwaves in Russia. This year’s was no exception: The press conference, which lasted nearly four hours, showcased the 65-year-old leader in command of the minutiae of governance. Key Words: In 2016 year-end news conference, Putin boasted that Russians alone had predicted Donald Trump’s victory in November But in contrast to years past, foreign policy wasn’t front-and-center. Putin recently declared his candidacy for a fourth and final presidential term, and his performance Thursday was in many ways reminiscent of a stump speech. “I would not like to talk about the pre-election program, which I, like other candidates, probably should have,” Putin said, before listing the areas he would like to promote, including health care, education and infrastructure. “I practically already have one.” He is widely expected to win the March vote. Thursday’s press conference was also an occasion for him to muse on geopolitical affairs. Asked about U.S.-Russian relations, Putin praised Trump’s performance, saying Washington was consumed by “spy mania” in the probe into Russian electoral meddling.

Taylor had obtained the bank draft — which is like a certified check, but the money is taken from a customer’s account immediately and held by the bank until the draft is cashed — after TD told her it was the safest way to send the large sum. Herbert, 61, said he went to his local UPS store near Cornwall, Ontario, where he was expecting the bank draft — but it never came. With mounting credit card debts and no source of income, Herbert said, he desperately needed the money to survive. What followed was a 10-month battle among the family, the bank and UPS that caused “unbelievable frustration,” Taylor said. TD had refused to refund the money unless Taylor signed an agreement to pay back the bank if someone cashed the lost draft, which does not expire like regular checks. By last Thursday afternoon, TD and the family reached an agreement — in the form of an indemnity contract that expires in February 2019. “It looks like the matter will be settled,” Taylor said.

Georg Szalai Walt Disney’s $52.4 billion acquisition of large parts of 21st Century Fox will create a Hollywood behemoth without equal under the leadership of chairman and CEO Bob Iger, who extended his contract through 2021. But others may not have similar job security. Disney is promising the deal will reap $2 billion in cost savings, and observers expect much of that to come through job losses, be they in the form of layoffs, attrition or buy-outs. Multiple town hall meetings on Dec. 14, the day the megadeal was announced, featured various division leaders at Disney and Fox taking questions from nervous employees worried for their futures. “No one believes assurances from management that our jobs are safe, and the assurances we were given were half-hearted at best,” said one Fox employee on the condition of anonymity. Indeed, in a letter to employees signed by Fox CEO James Murdoch, along with co-executive chairmen Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, a few sentences were interpreted as an acknowledgment that headcount would be slashed: “We are deeply committed to finding opportunities for our people as well as ensuring that anyone impacted is well taken care of,” read the letter, a copy of which made its way into a regulatory filing. Despite job concerns among rank-and-file employees, the hook-up has the elements of a fairytale wedding for Disney, which will acquire film franchises like Avatar, Fantastic Four and X-Men, along with cable TV networks Nat Geo and FX. The success of the marriage, though, depends on how well the management teams can integrate. {

        } Here’s how some key Fox executives could fit into the Disney structure: James Murdoch, CEO: While dad Rupert and brother Lachlan are expected to focus on the remaining Fox assets, and possibly take them private, James is understood to be looking for a top Disney executive post. Given his expertise in international TV and knowledge of European pay TV giant Sky and Indian TV powerhouse Star India, analysts have suggested he could take on an international role. The main question here is how he’d mesh with Walt Disney International chairman Andy Bird, who reports directly to Iger, and whether Murdoch would be open to such a role after being CEO. “James and I will be talking over the next number of months,” Iger said Dec. 14. “He’s going to be integral to the integration process, and he and I will be discussing whether there is a role for him or not at our company.” Whatever Murdoch’s title (if he gets one), the expectation is that he’d have four years to work his way into serious consideration as Iger’s successor. “We think this would be positive for Disney,” says Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. “Such an appointment would not be without concerns given the harassment issues that emerged at Fox News and the hacking scandal in the U.K., which both emerged under his watch; however, we think that it is unlikely any CEO candidate would emerge without some shortcomings.” Alternatively, those close to Murdoch say he is considering launching a new entrepreneurial venture, maybe with Disney’s backing, given that the three Murdochs are set to receive nearly 88 million Disney shares, making them the company’s largest individual shareholders. Peter Rice, 21st Century Fox president, and chairman and CEO, Fox Networks Group: Rice is in charge of Fox networks but also has past film experience as a former president of Fox Searchlight Pictures and Fox Atomic. An executive search expert said that such broad experience gives him a good shot at getting a significant role at Disney, possibly even one that could position him, too, as a contender for the Disney CEO role after Iger retires. Stacey Snider, chairman and CEO, Twentieth Century Fox Film: Alan Horn is a veteran in charge of Walt Disney Studios but he turns 75 early in 2018. Snider’s previous work running Universal and DreamWorks, along with her work at Fox, could position her as an immediate or mid-term successor to Horn. Some analysts, though, suggest Disney is comfortable letting Snider operate Fox as a separate studio until she proves herself worthy of larger role. “The case for sticking with Fox studio management is that Disney has traditionally been inclined to allow acquired managers to continue on, as in Pixar, Lucasfilm etc,” says Vogel Capital Management CEO and former industry analyst Hal Vogel. Dana Walden and Gary Newman, co-chairs and CEOs, Fox Television Group: With Disney buying the TV studio operation, one part of the business the duo oversees will go to the enlarged entertainment giant while the other, the Fox broadcast network, is staying with the remaining company, raising questions about where the executives will end up. One Wall Street observer suggested the Fox TV studio business would be folded into ABC Studios, led by president Patrick Moran, so there may be no need for more unit heads. And Walden has in the past been tipped for roles at peers, including Amazon Studios. John Landgraf, CEO, FX Networks: His talent relationships and success in making FX a destination of popular shows, coupled with Disney’s interest in original content for its planned streaming service that will be akin to Netflix, has observers expecting he’ll remain with the company. But edgy FX shows like Sons of Anarchy and American Horror Story do not target Disney’s typical demographic, with the Parents Television Council already criticizing the impending deal because it doesn’t like the idea of family-friendly Disney giving its seal of approval to FX. {""width"":696,""height"":928,""extension"":""jpg"",""file_size"":208293,""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""sites\/default\/files\/2017\/12\/disneycover-1_-_embed_2017.jpg"",""orientation"":""portrait"",""id"":1068258,""credit"":""Illustration by Guy Shield"",""caption"":""""} {

They have denied allegations that the exchanges favor high-frequency trading, or HFT firms, over slower-moving investors. HFT firms use powerful computers and ultrafast network connections to trade large volumes of stocks. The class-action case grew out of a lawsuit filed in 2014 by the city of Providence, R.I., after the publication of Michael Lewis’s best-seller “Flash Boys,” which accused high-frequency traders of exploiting ordinary investors. Tuesday’s decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed a 2015 ruling in which a federal district judge threw out the city’s lawsuit. In that ruling, Judge Jesse M. Furman of the Southern District of New York agreed with the exchanges’ argument that they were immune to such lawsuits. Now, the case is being sent back to federal district court.

(bit.ly/2BXJzz6) “The time is right in Alphabet’s evolution for this transition,” Schmidt said in a statement. “I’m incredibly excited about the progress our companies are making and about the strong leaders who are driving that innovation,” said Chief Executive Larry Page in a statement. Schmidt, who was recruited to the company by Google co-founders Page and Sergey Brin, served as chief executive from 2001 through 2011, acting as what the three jokingly referred to as the “adult supervision.” Schmidt then became executive chairman, often traveling the world touting the company’s accomplishments, negotiating with governments on regulatory matters and speaking about the state of the tech industry. “He helped them mature into the powerhouse business it is today without throwing away the uniqueness that was Google during those early days,” said Joe Beda, chief technology officer of Seattle startup Heptio and a Google employee from 2004 through 2014. Among Schmidt’s accomplishments were taking the company public in 2004, shepherding critical product initiatives like the Android mobile operating system, and overseeing a massive 2015 corporate restructuring in which Google became a business unit of the holding company Alphabet. Bismarck Lepe, CEO of San Francisco startup Wizeline and a Google employee from 2003 until 2007, said Page and Brin focused on the company’s technology and the product strategies, while Schmidt focused on how to scale every product to a global level. Schmidt “was incredibly smart and incredibly technical, which made him a perfect fit,” Lepe added. Schmidt’s tenure was not without its problems. Google, Apple and several other tech companies were hit with a class action lawsuit in 2011 alleging that executives including Schmidt and the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs conspired to keep wages down by not hiring one anothers’ employees. The suit was settled for $415 million in 2015. The company has also been hit with lawsuits alleging that it pays women less than men. It also faces a series of antitrust actions in Europe, though Schmidt was instrumental in convincing the U.S. Federal Trade Commission not to pursue antitrust actions in the United States. Schmidt spent more than a decade at Sun Microsystems and  ran the now-defunct networking company Novell before joining Google in 2001. The 2004 initial public offering came at time when the industry was still reeling from the dot-com bust, but it helped lay the groundwork for the current boom. Shuman Ghosemajumder, chief technology officer of Mountain View, California, startup Shape Security and a Google employee from 2003 until 2010, recalled that shortly after the IPO, Schmidt spoke at an all-hands meetings and said that he, Page and Brin had the ambition of making Google a $100 billion company. “Did you mean a $100 billion market cap or $100 billion in revenue?” one employee asked. “And Eric said ‘You pick,’” recalled Ghosemajumder. “That was definitely inspiring to me.” Alphabet now carries a market cap of $741 billion, and this year, it is projected to surpass $100 billion in annual revenue, according to analyst estimates.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet, la maison mère de Google, a annoncé jeudi la démission de son président exécutif Eric Schmidt, signant la fin d’un cycle de 17 années durant lesquelles il a fait d’une start-up prometteuse de la Silicon Valley une entreprise technologique mondiale. Après sa démission, qui sera effective en janvier, Eric Schmidt conservera un rôle de conseil du groupe sur les questions scientifiques et techniques. Eric Schmidt reste membre du conseil d’administration. “C’est le bon moment dans l’évolution d’Alphabet pour cette transition”, déclare Eric Schmidt dans un communiqué en soulignant que les activités du groupe se portent bien. Eric Schmidt, qui a été recruté chez Google par ses fondateurs Larry Page et Sergey Brin, en a été le directeur général pendant dix ans, de 2001 à 2011. Son rôle, comme ils le soulignaient tous les trois sur le ton de la plaisanterie, était d’assurer une “supervision adulte” de la société. Eric Schmidt est ensuite devenu président du conseil d’administration. Il voyageait beaucoup pour faire la promotion du groupe, négocier avec les gouvernements sur les questions de réglementation et faire des conférences sur la situation du secteur technologique. Eric Schmidt a notamment organisé l’introduction en Bourse de Google en 2004. Il a aussi été à l’origine du développement du système d’exploitation pour téléphones mobiles Android. Il a aussi supervisé la grande restructuration du groupe en 2015 qui a fait de Google une filiale de la holding de tête du groupe, Alphabet. Larry page et Sergey Brin étaient concentrés sur la technologie du groupe et ses stratégies en matière de produits, tandis qu’Eric Schmidt était chargé de voir comment faire de chaque produit un produit mondial, explique Bismarck Lepe, patron de la start-up californienne Wizeline et employé de Google entre 2003 et 2007. La gestion d’Eric Schmidt a aussi connu quelques bas. Google, Apple et plusieurs sociétés technologiques ont été poursuivi en justice à la faveur d’une action de groupe (“class action”) en 2001. Les plaignants accusaient un certain nombre de dirigeants de ces groupes, dont Eric Schmidt, et le patron de l’époque d’Apple, Steve jobs, aujourd’hui décédé, de s’être entendus pour maintenir les salaires de leurs employés à un niveau bas en s’engageant à ne pas employer les employés de l’autre. L’affaire s’est réglée par une transaction à l’amiable de 415 millions de dollars en 2015. Shuman Ghosemajumder, directeur technique de la start-up Shape Security et employé de Google entre 2003 et 2010 se souvient que peu de temps après la mise sur le marché de Google, Eric Schmidt avait expliqué dans une réunion, qu’avec Larry Page et Sergey Brin, il avait l’intention de créer une société à 100 milliards de dollars. “Vous voulez dire à 100 milliards de capitalisation boursière ou à 100 milliards de chiffre d’affaires?”, avait demandé un employé. “A vous de choisir”, avait répondu Eric Schmidt selon le récit de Shuman Ghosemajumder. Aujourd’hui, Alphabet affiche une capitalisation boursière de 741 milliards de dollars (625 milliards d’euros) et, selon les estimations des analystes, son chiffre d’affaires devrait dépasser cette année les 100 milliards de dollars.

That’s the advice from internet pioneer Vint Cerf, who is afraid that all our digital memories could be lost as technology moves on. “People say: ‘What should I do about my photographs?’ The ones you really care about? Find some really good quality photographic paper and print them, because we know those will last at least 150 years,” Cerf told reporters on the sidelines of the Internet Governance Forum in Geneva. “I know for a fact that I have information, in digital form, down in my basement, on 5-¼ inch floppy disks. And I know the bits are still there. But I don’t have anything that knows how to read them any more.” Cerf, a Google vice-president and co-designer of the TCP/IP protocol that connects devices over the internet, said he managed to find a disk drive for some of his ancient disks, only to discover he lacked the software to read them. “If we want our descendants to know something about our world we have to make sure the information is still retrievable or understandable,” he said. A white-bearded 74-year-old nicknamed “the Father of the Internet”, Cerf jotted notes on his conference program as he spoke, and confessed that in several ways paper was better than the state-of-the-art phone he clutched in his other hand. “First of all you can make little sketches easily on paper, and second it’s on my (Governance Forum) calendar, that means I can remember where was I, and what was I doing, when I wrote that note. So for me, this is like a plug-in extra memory,” he said, to laughter. “Look, I also wear three piece suits. I’m just a 19th century guy in a 21st century world.” ","

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"PARIS (Reuters) - German carmaker Daimler has agreed to buy a majority stake in Chauffeur Prive, a French rival to the larger Uber car-ride app, in the latest example of traditional companies looking to deal with challenges from technology-driven start-ups. The deal was announced in a joint statement by both companies. The price of the acquisition, which will be carried out by the German company’s Daimler Mobility Services division, was not disclosed. Chauffeur Prive was founded in 2011. The company says it has more than 1.5 million customers and access to 18,000 drivers, and the service is relatively popular in Paris. Traditional automakers from around the world are examining how best to work on new, disruptive technologies - from electric vehicles to autonomous driving - that require hefty investment and have turned companies such as Google and Tesla into rivals. Daimler has already made forays into the growing industry of car-ride hailing mobile applications. In June, Dubai-based ride hailing firm Careem said it would step up its expansion into new markets after raising $150 million from investors, which included Daimler and Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding. Earlier this month, Daimler’s French rival Renault bought a stake in a glossy magazine publishing group, which it said formed part of its strategy to see how to keep travelers entertained in an era of driverless cars.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has unveiled a new, 10,000-strong military cyber warfare unit to counter “wrong” views on the Internet, media reported, amid a widening crackdown on critics of the one-party state. The cyber unit, named Force 47, is already in operation in several sectors, Tuoi Tre newspaper quoted Lieutenant General Nguyen Trong Nghia, deputy head of the military’s political department, as saying at a conference of the Central Propaganda Department on Monday in the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City. “In every hour, minute, and second we must be ready to fight proactively against the wrong views,” the paper quoted the general as saying. Communist-ruled Vietnam has stepped up attempts to tame the internet, calling for closer watch over social networks and for the removal of content that it deems offensive, but there has been little sign of it silencing criticism when the companies providing the platforms are global. Its neighbor China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules. The number of staff compares with the 6,000 reportedly employed by North Korea. However, the general’s comments suggest its force may be focused largely on domestic internet users whereas North Korea is internationally focused because the internet is not available to the public at large. In August, Vietnam’s president said the country needed to pay greater attention to controlling “news sites and blogs with bad and dangerous content”. Vietnam, one of the top 10 countries for Facebook users by numbers, has also drafted an internet security bill asking for local placement of Facebook and Google servers, but the bill has been the subject of heated debate at the National Assembly and is still pending assembly approval. “Vietnam is certainly not alone. FireEye has observed a proliferation in offensive capabilities ... This proliferation has implications for many parties, including governments, journalists, activists and even multinational firms,” a spokesman at FireEye, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. “Cyber espionage is increasingly attractive to nation states, in part because it can provide access to a significant amount of information with a modest investment, plausible deniability and limited risk,” he added. Vietnam denies such charges. Vietnam has in recent months stepped up measures to silence critics. A court last month jailed a blogger for seven years for “conducting propaganda against the state”. In a separate, similar case last month, a court upheld a 10-year jail sentence for a prominent blogger. ","

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"LONDON (Reuters) - British app-based bank Monzo and others like it want to make money by allowing other firms access to their customers rather than lending to them, but this is an untested path to profitability. Monzo’s user numbers soared by 300 percent to 450,000 in nine months this year, which has attracted investors and more than doubled its valuation to $336 million. The bank’s distinctive coral-coloured card has become commonplace in the wallets of the young and tech savvy. But this growth has come at a cost: until recently every customer meant a loss of 50 pounds ($67) as Monzo offered services such as overseas cash withdrawals for free. “The more you grow, the more you lose and you have to turn that corner at some point,” CEO Tom Blomfield told Reuters, referring to the moment when each customer is no longer a loss to the bank. However he has no target for overall profitability at Monzo. Monzo and competitors like Starling Bank still largely steer clear of the loans and hefty fees for overdrafts or foreign exchange that have been so lucrative for existing banks, but which the newcomers see as ripping off consumers. Absorbing such costs has been expensive for some of the upstarts, but they think they can make money from a new model based on using customers’ data to push them towards other financial services, taking a commission whenever it works. If successful, they could eat into the retail banking profits of the big banks just as new rules are being introduced to reduce their dominance, and returns are being shredded by tougher regulation and growing competition. They see the big banks’ approach, built around lending out customers’ deposits at higher rates of interest, as costly. Capital requirements are high, which would affect the way investors looked at the newcomers if they took that route. “Your business tends to get valued like a bank and not like Google,” said Blomfield. (For graphic on Digital banks' rise, click tmsnrt.rs/2BdERcZ) The digital-only banks boast slick apps, which can analyze spending in real time, send budgeting nudges and allow users to freeze and unfreeze their card at the click of a button. Aurelie Gonnage, a 25-year-old advertising producer, uses her Monzo account to budget, pay friends easily and spend abroad without large fees. “I love the instantaneity of it,” she said, although she wouldn’t use it as her main bank because it pays no interest on deposits and has no branches to visit in an emergency. But for the new banks, becoming central to users’ lives is the key to accessing the wealth of data needed to nudge them toward the right products, and making money in the process. “The important place in people’s financial lives is where the data is,” said Starling Bank CEO Anne Boden. Partner firms plug into the apps, creating a “marketplace” of services ranging from loans and investments to insurance and energy, and paying the banks a fee whenever a customer signs up to their offering. The banks will rely on this for income to varying degrees. Boden said it will account for around a third of revenues at Starling, while Monzo’s Blomfield expects it to be the bank’s main source of income in the long term. “The difficulty is you need massive scale and access to data to really make it work,” he said. Achieving that could be difficult as others pursue similar strategies, said John Cronin, head of UK banks research at analyst firm Goodbody. Virgin Money VM.L also has plans for a marketplace, and HSBC is piloting a money management app. Other big players are expected to follow suit in response to new regulations forcing them to share their customer data with potential competitors. The new banks’ branchless, digital proposition means they benefit from far lower costs. Nevertheless, digital player Revolut, with a 300 million pound valuation and 1.2 million users, believes it couldn’t achieve the scale it wants with marketplace money alone. Subscriptions for premium and business accounts resulted in 2.36 million pounds of turnover in 2016 and Revolut plans to offer overdrafts and loans too. It expects to break even by the end of 2018. Starling plans to hit the same milestone one year later. Interest from overdrafts will provide a third of its income, said Boden, with more funds coming from a business-facing payments service and upcoming business accounts. Monzo is also currently rolling out overdrafts and exploring one lending product. Edward Firth, managing director, UK banks at analysts KBW, said big banks make such a good return on retail banking that the digital upstarts can halve it and still make enough profit. He has more confidence in models where the marketplace supplements such income, rather than the other way around. “It’s still untested,” he said. Eileen Burbidge, partner at venture capital firm Passion Capital, which backs Monzo, said the bank’s rapid growth validates her confidence in its ethos and model. “That kind of engagement or interest from consumers is really unheard of in financial services,” she said. Still, the firm wants Monzo to prove that each customer can drive more revenue than they drive cost within a year or so. Monzo has already halved the cost per user, although that has meant cutting back on some key offers: previously unlimited overseas ATM withdrawals cost it 16 pounds per customer. Now it will start adding revenues. Blomfield sees the marketplace playing an increasingly important role, although he added: “Until it plays out it’s hard to know for sure.” ","

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"(Reuters Health) - - Online health education materials about transplant options are far too complex for chronic kidney disease patients to make sense of, U.S. researchers say, and that may prevent this group from deciding on the best treatment. Researchers looked at the top 20 websites with information about living-donor and deceased-donor kidney transplants, and they found that most sites required at least a college-level reading ability, according to the report in Clinical Kidney Journal. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that patient-education material be written for a seventh-grade reading level. Health literacy is “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions,” according to NIH. “The principle goes beyond just scheduling an appointment or skimming a waiting room pamphlet. It involves critical thinking and the ability to weigh pros and cons when facing a medical crossroads.” “We have identified a discrepancy in readability of online content and the corresponding health literacy rates among the chronic kidney disease population,” said lead study author Dr. Eric Zhou of Rhode Island Hospital and Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence. The implication for clinicians is a need to better tailor health counseling materials for specific types of patients with varying literacy rates, Zhou told Reuters Health by email. The researchers searched Google for websites with information for patients about both living- and deceased-donor kidney transplants, and selected the top 10 sites for each category. They transferred the content of the sites to plain-text documents then used software to analyze the difficulty level of each site’s text. On sites about both types of transplant, the mean reading level score was at college-freshman level or above, the study found. Even the least complex texts were close to a ninth-grade reading level and none were at the recommended seventh-grade level. “Literacy rates are directly associated with one’s likelihood to receive a transplant,” said Abbey Swanson Kazley of the Medical University of South Carolina College of Health Professions in Charleston, who wasn’t involved in the study. More-educated patients have an upper hand when navigating the medical system, she told Reuters Health. Conversely, those with lower reading levels tend to have greater difficulty completing the necessary steps for transplantation, which can have a dramatically negative impact on patient care, compliance and long-term outcomes. The concern is not just for potential transplant recipients. “If a potential donor’s questions were not answered or if they were confused, they may abandon the process without a realistic understanding of the risks and benefits of donating,” said the current study’s senior author, Dr. Paul Morrissey, also of Rhode Island Hospital and Warren Alpert Medical School. Of the 10 sites about living-donor transplants the researchers analyzed, all were academic university-based sites, the study notes. Of the 10 sites about deceased-donor transplants, four were academic, four were from third parties and two were from government sources. If validated health information is too complex to understand, patients may seek out more readable sources such as online forums, blogs or support groups that go unmonitored by professional practitioners, Zhou said. These sources often contain inaccurate or non-scientific information, which may alter a patient’s understanding of a particular disease process. The next steps, Zhou added, “would be to implement different online patient education materials that are appropriate for each individual’s health literacy level.” “Specialists should review materials to make sure they are not using too much jargon or writing at an advanced level,” Kazley said. “Use multiple mediums of delivery, such as videos, written text and conversation. This will help with the educational process.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2BT1lnn Clinical Kidney Journal, online November 24, 2017. ","

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has closed more than 13,000 websites since the beginning of 2015 for breaking the law or other rules and the vast majority of people support government efforts to clean up cyberspace, state news agency Xinhua said on Sunday. The government has stepped up already tight controls over the internet since President Xi Jinping took power five years ago, in what critics say is an effort to restrict freedom of speech and prevent criticism of the ruling Communist Party. The government says all countries regulate the internet, and its rules are aimed at ensuring national security and social stability and preventing the spread of pornography and violent content. A report to the on-going session of the standing committee of China’s largely rubber stamp parliament said the authorities had targeted pornography and violence in their sweeps of websites, blogs and social media accounts, Xinhua said. As well as the 13,000 websites shut down, almost 10 million accounts had also been closed by websites, it added. It did not give details but the accounts were likely on social media platforms. “Internet security concerns the party’s long-term hold on power, the country’s long-term peace and stability, socio-economic development and the people’s personal interests,” Xinhua said. More than 90 percent of people surveyed supported government efforts to manage the internet, with 63.5 percent of them believing that in recent years there has been an obvious reduction in harmful online content, it added. “These moves have a powerful deterrent effect,” Wang Shengjun, vice chairman of parliament’s standing committee, told legislators, according to Xinhua. Authorities including the Cyberspace Administration of China have summoned more than 2,200 websites operators for talks during the same period, he said. Separately, Xinhua said that over the past five years, more than 10 million people who refused to register using their real names had internet or other telecoms accounts suspended. China ushered in a tough cyber security law in June, following years of fierce debate around the controversial legislation that many foreign business groups fear will hit their ability to operate in the country.

,12282017,Reuters,12212017,"(This version of December 21’s story refiles to add dropped words ‘for couples’ in paragraph 8.) By Paresh Dave, Heather Somerville and Jeffrey Dastin And contrary to the dire warnings of California officials, a large swath of Bay Area workers and their families stand to get a tax break as well, even with new limits on state and local tax deductions. California has the highest state income tax in the nation, and Governor Jerry Brown has called the new tax bill “evil in the extreme.” Nonetheless, many in Silicon Valley stand to benefit. Startup employees, freelancers and venture capital investors are among those who will get new tax benefits or keep those they already have, tax experts said. Even some of the middle- and upper-income professionals who form the core of the technology industry workforce will still get significant tax cuts, while most others will see little change, they said. The new $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions will have a less dramatic effect than feared because such deductions in many cases had already been rendered moot by the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a mechanism for assuring that the well-heeled pay at least 26 percent of their income in taxes. “There is a lot of noise about workers in California, New Jersey, New York and Illinois (facing higher taxes), but 80 percent of our clients there were already paying the alternative minimum tax so they don’t benefit from the state and local deductions,” said Jack Meccia, a tax associate at financial planning firm Vestboard, which works with several hundred individuals in tech. The new law alters the AMT in a way that vastly reduces the number of people who have to pay it, from more than 5 million to an estimated 200,000 next year, according to the Tax Policy Center. The AMT dynamics, combined with reduced overall tax rates and the doubling of the standard deduction to $24,000 for couples should hold most Bay Area tax bills steady, said Bob McGrath, tax director at accounting firm Burr Pilger Mayer. Estimates by three experts, using roughly similar assumptions, show that a home-owning couple earning a combined $250,000 in Silicon Valley would likely see an increase or decrease in their tax bill of a few hundred dollars. A married couple with no children who rent a home and make a combined $150,000 would see a $3,900 tax cut, estimated Annette Nellen, who directs the master’s degree in taxation program at San Jose State University. Low-income workers will see tax cuts too, though the dollar amounts are small. Bob Emmett, a single, 73-year-old security officer who lives in San Jose, criticized the bill as “designed to help the rich.” Nellen estimated that Emmett, who rents an apartment, has no children and earns $16 an hour in addition to some social security income, would see a $546 cut in taxes. Critics of the tax bill note that the individual tax cuts will disappear after 2025, and that most of the benefits flow to the corporations and the wealthiest individuals, even if lower-income people get some tax relief. Health insurance premiums for Californians are also likely to rise substantially as a result of the repeal of fines for those who refuse to obtain health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And even if Bay Area residents mostly enjoy some tax cuts, they gain much less than those in low-tax states. Employees in Silicon Valley, the world’s startup capital, scored two major victories in the tax bill. First, startup employees can hold off on paying taxes related to stock options they exercised. That can be a big help if a company is still private, since in that situation employees have to pay tax even before they can earn cash from selling shares. Startup employees will also have more opportunity to exercise what are known as “incentive stock options” with less chance of being on the hook for the alternative minimum tax, according to Mark Setzen, a long-time certified public accountant in Silicon Valley. Also coming out ahead are independent contractors, ranging from engineers to marketers to caterers, who stand to benefit from a new 20 percent deduction of business income. Arun Sood, a freelance software engineer in San Francisco who makes about $150,000 annually, said he accrues few  deductions because he rents his home, holds no debt and has no children. Now he gets a big new deduction and a lower tax rate. “Looking at this selfishly, it’s going to be a positive impact,” said Sood, who has freelanced for Axios, Cisco and Macy’s. The tax plan mostly preserves a tax break for venture capitalists that had been in jeopardy. The so-called carried interest provision lets venture capitalists book the 20 percent fee they typically take on a profitable investment as a capital gain, which carries a lower tax rate than ordinary income, even though the venture investors do not put up any of their personal capital. Now the capital gains rate will apply only to investments held at least three years — a limitation that venture capitalists said would come into play only occasionally. Silicon Valley executives with high salaries will take home extra money, too, because language in the current tax law known as the Pease Limitation had already limited their deductions, said Andrew Mattson, a tax partner serving technology industry clients at accountancy Moss Adams. Executives also may see base pay rise in coming years. The tax bill removes corporate tax breaks for performance bonuses, which is already leading companies to reconsider pay packages for chief-level executives, lawyers said. ","

Catherine Clifford,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"Google is famous for its ""20 percent time,"" whereby staffers are allowed to spend the equivalent of one workday a week on passion projects that they believe will benefit the company. The idea is that creativity and innovation happen when people are allowed to experiment. Things such as Gmail and Chromebooks have resulted, according to a Google spokesperson. Whether the policy still exists has been debated over the last few years. But on Thursday, Google announced that artificial intelligence researcher and senior software engineer Chris Shallue discovered two new planets — and it was born of a flex-time side venture. One day, it could even help discover alien life. ""I'm a Google AI researcher with an interest in space, and started this work as a 20 percent project,"" writes Shallue in a  statement from Google. He read about the existence of vast quantities of planetary data NASA had collected via its Kepler spacecraft and telescope, which has taken a photo from its orbit every 30 minutes for the last four years, according to Google. Shallue recognized the un-mined information as ripe for an AI experiment. ""Machine learning really shines in situations where there is so much data that humans can't search it for themselves,"" says Shallue in a NASA statement. (The Kepler dataset took two weeks to download and didn't fit on a desktop, according to a Reddit ""ask me anything"" with Shallue.) Shallue recruited Andrew Vanderberg, an astrophysicist and doctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, for help on the project, which took about nine months. Together the pair used 15,000 NASA data points to create a neural network, or artificial intelligence organized in a similar way to neurons in the brain. It learned to recognize small light patterns indicating the existence of a planet that previous automated and manual tests had missed. AI takes on a new mission: planet hunting. See how we used machine learning to hunt for new planets in @NASAKepler data–and actually found one To verify that the neural AI was accurate, Vanderberg used it on a set of photos of 670 stars, then compared that to manually sorted results. What took Vanderberg eight hours to complete took the neural network only a few minutes, the astronomer tells CNBC Make It. Shallue and Vanderberg had taught the system ""how to identify planets around faraway stars,"" says Shallue in the Google statement. The two planets Shallue and Vanderberg discovered are ""exoplanets,"" or planets rotating around sun-like stars other than the one Earth revolves around. Kepler-90i was found to be the eighth planet circling the Kepler-90 star, 2,545 light-years from Earth. The only other solar system known to have eight planets rotating around a sun is our solar system.

""It's like sifting through rocks to find jewels. If you have a finer sieve, then you will catch more rocks but you might catch more jewels, as well."" Beyond discovering new planets, this technological development is a step toward discovering alien life, explains Vanderberg to CNBC Make It. ""The main reason we decided to work on this project was to help us measure how common Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars are,"" Vanderberg tells CNBC Make It. He estimates finding alien life could be possible somewhere between 2030 and 2050.

Michelle Castillo,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"Amazon has been quietly experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off its website, according to interviews with half a dozen ad buyers and technology partners. And it's getting ready to make waves in 2018. Most of the conversations are focusing on new ad opportunities on Amazon's e-commerce search and video products, sources say. The company is also looking to sell advertising beyond Amazon sites and products. For example, a source with knowledge about the situation says it is working with third-party mobile advertising companies such as Kargo to pair advertising on television and on mobile screens. Ad industry sources also say Amazon is stepping up hiring for its advertising division, especially in the New York area. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted that the company was hiring more ad sales staff on its  Q2 earnings call in July. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on its advertising business. Digital advertising was a $209 billion business globally in 2017, according to media buying research firm Magna Global. And it's only increasing: The company predicts the industry will grow 13 percent to $237 billion next year. The U.S. is currently the most lucrative market, where advertisers spent $40.1 billion on digital advertising during the first half of 2017 alone, according to digital ad industry group Interactive Advertising Bureau. Although Amazon doesn't break out revenues from its advertising business, eMarketer estimates Amazon was the fifth-largest digital advertiser in the U.S. in terms of revenue this year. Still, it makes up a little more than 2 percent of the market. It's leagues below industry leaders Google and Facebook, which take home more than 70 percent combined, according to a recent estimate from analysts at Pivotal. But advertisers have been searching for a third large competitor in order to lower prices and force Google and Facebook to be more open about sharing user data. Amazon could be a major player, if only based on the sheer volume of consumer insights it has thanks to its robust e-commerce business. Two media buyers said Amazon showed some willingness to share more user data than Google and Facebook have traditionally — if the advertising budget was big enough. As a result, advertisers are welcoming Amazon with open arms, with one media buyer saying some of its consumer packaged goods clients already spend more on Amazon search ads than Google. Another media buyer said that while Google is still the search ad category leader, Amazon is gaining ground and budgets are quickly shifting in its direction. ""Driving conversion and sales or creating very immersive high-impact branded content is what drives a lot of digital advertising revenue,"" said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. ""Amazon is a player in both those areas."" Amazon already allows companies to sponsor product listings so they will show up at the top of relevant search results in its store. It wants to expand, offering advertisers better data and algorithms to ensure its items get in front of the ideal customer. It's also selling custom pages with built-in video and stories to help advertisers' products stand out from the rest, such as this Acura ad. ""Amazon likes to talk about how 56 percent of product searches are coming through Amazon,"" said Diana Gordon, senior partner at media agency Mindshare. ""It's definitely a stat that causes advertisers to stand up."" If you remove the buy box on Amazon's site, it would rank in the top five of daily trafficked sites online, Gordon explained. Amazon can not only drive sales, it's becoming a place for people to read reviews. ""We know that consumers are using Amazon not only as retail, but also using it as product discovery and research,"" Gordon said. ""It could lead to making more purchases in brick-and-mortar stores."" Amazon also wants to expand video advertising business. In addition to allowing commercials on livestreamed content like it did on its Thursday Night Football streams this year, it's pitching companies on bespoke sponsored content. The branded videos would be created by established media publishers or by Amazon's own internal production team. Some ideas that are being floated around are creating infomercial-style videos for products with celebrity spokespeople. ""We have been having conversations of how do you take advantage of the video offering on Prime through digital advertising,"" said Sargi Mann, digital executive vice president at Havas Media Group. ""Instead of having superfluous ads, how can a brand have a part of that dialogue that is not advertising in its traditional form? I am always open and like to discuss new and innovative ways in media where ads can be more of an organic insertion."" In addition, the company has aspirations to expand advertising opportunities past owned-and-operated products. In December 2016, it launched cloud-based ad technology Transparent Ad Marketplace as a way for companies to buy display advertising on sites across the web. Header bidding services such as Transparent Ad Marketplace allow media buyers to bid on available advertising inventory before Google's DoubleClick can. Amazon wants to do more in the programmatic ad tech space, according to sources. The company is also looking to mobile ad technology partners to find ways to advertise across multiple devices. For example, it is in talks to work with Kargo to pair commercials with mobile ads, sources say. Theoretically, a sponsored product sold on Amazon would run during a TV show and then seconds later a viewer would be able to see a related ad on their mobile phone. But Amazon has some disadvantages as it looks to take on pure-play advertisers Google and Facebook. In particular, working with Amazon causes conflict for some companies, since it is disrupting the way they traditionally sold products, forcing them to change strategies. ""The reality is Amazon makes a lot of brands and companies nervous, and presence on Amazon is a necessary evil,"" said Thomas Choi, RPA chief product officer of media. ""For others in categories like automotive, it's going to replace the existing sales and purchase process. It's a little bit of a mixed bag about how brands perceive them.""

Jillian D'Onfro,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"Google recently revealed its plans for a massive new development project in Sunnyvale, California, a few miles away from its main headquarters in Mountain View. The company's proposal, which it filed late Wednesday night, describes two green-space laden buildings, totaling ~1.04 million square feet, that could house up to 4,500 Googlers. The project also includes 2,085 parking spots. Google's renderings of the proposed campus include sloping outdoor paths that would allow employees to move between each of the building's five floors: Development would take place in Moffett Park and mark the latest in Google's lofty efforts to make Sunnyvale a greater hub for its business. In 2017, has snapped up about 50 properties valued at more than $1 billion, according to The Mercury News. Google is calling the project ""Caribbean,"" because one of the building is located on Caribbean Drive, and it's part of the search giant's broader vision for Sunnyvale, which includes employee housing. ""Housing and transportation are two huge issues for the Valley overall, and they are huge issues for Google,"" Google's global real estate chief Mark Golan  told The Mercury News. ""One of the best ways to address this is by creating mixed-use communities that allow people to live close to where they work, which allows for a vibrant community and also helps the transportation."" Google doesn't expect the Caribbean complex to open until 2021 at the earliest. Andrew Miner, one of Sunnyvale's principal planners, tells CNBC that the Planning Department had not yet had a chance to review the application. Google's parent company, Alphabet, claimed 78,101 total employees as of its Q3 earnings. You can read all 37 pages of Google's proposal here. ",Google Sunnyvale Campus plans revealed
Courtney Connley,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"Google recently released its list of the year's top trending topics and it may come as little surprise that ""how to buy bitcoin"" was one of the tasks people searched for most in 2017. In recent months, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin have captured the attention of many people who are contemplating the risks and benefits of investing their money in digital currencies. Successful individuals like legendary investor Jack Bogle and ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O'Leary warn potential investors about the downside to putting their money in bitcoin. However, success stories like the Winklevoss twins, who are reportedly the world's first bitcoin billionaires, call into question whether or not the investment is a risk worth taking. Topping bitcoin, which came in at No. 3 on Google's ""how to"" search list, are the tasks ""how to make slime"" and ""how to make solar eclipse glasses."" Slime, which holds the No. 1 spot, became a trending topic in 2017 with the popularity of online videos showing various objects you can make from the gooey substance. On Instagram, you'll find more than 6 million posts if you search the #slime hashtag. Meanwhile, searching the topic on YouTube reveals that millions have watched slime videos. In May, Newell Brands CEO Michael Polk spoke to CNBC's Jim Cramer about the impact slime is having on his business. As the parent company for Elmer's Glue, which is the main ingredient used in slime projects, Polk says the brand received nearly 200,000 social media mentions about slime from March to May of 2017. Retail sales of the liquid glue rose 25 percent in 2016 thanks to the trend. Following how to make slime on Google's most searched list is ""how to make solar eclipse glasses."" In August, when the solar eclipse hit, many people scrambled to find the special glasses needed to watch the event. With top retailers selling out of the eyewear, and with experts warning the public to stay clear of counterfeits on the market, it's no surprise that many people turned to Google to figure out how to make their own spectacles. Here's Google's full list of the top 10 ""how to"" searches of 2017: 1. How to make slime 2. How to make solar eclipse glasses 3. How to buy bitcoin 4. How to watch Mayweather vs. McGregor 5.

Jillian D'Onfro,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"When Casey, a security officer in his early 30s from San Jose, California, first started playing the Japanese mobile game Puzzles & Dragons, he was obsessed. ""I would play constantly, everyday,"" he says. ""Even on my breaks at work, I would play non-stop."" During his first month, he estimates that he spent about $600 in the game, mainly to obtain special characters (many Japanese games use  a ""Gacha"" mechanism where users can spin to win prizes). He says he has friends who he knows have spent thousands of dollars on Puzzles & Dragons. Although Casey lives in California, not Japan, his playing habits resembled those of a typical Japanese gamer: super high engagement and a willingness to shell out real money. Japan is the top market for mobile game revenue and its spoils have surpassed mobile gaming revenue in the United States for the third year in a row, according to data from App Annie, despite the fact that the U.S. has three times as many smartphone users. Japan ranks highest in terms of average number of sessions in games per app user, and Japanese mobile app users use gaming apps twice as frequently as users in the US. Of the 12 public companies that have disclosed that they are generating 25% or more of their revenue through Google parent company Alphabet, the seven most reliant are all Japanese app developers, according to data from FactSet. These companies make money through the Google Play Store. Gungho, the company that created Puzzles & Dragons, makes 35.7% of its revenue from Google Play and 54.1% from Apple's App Store, according to FactSet. The company most reliant on Google Play, Ignis, sourced 48% of its revenue through Play and 38.1% of its revenue through the App Store. That highlights what's particularly interesting about Japan: The Japanese mobile game market leans more heavily toward Google's Android platform than other markets. Consider Zynga, the American app company with the highest disclosed percentage of its revenue coming from Alphabet: The breakdown is 29% Google Play Store, 46% Apple App Store. That's in line with the conventional wisdom that iPhone users are generally wealthier than Android users and tend to spend significantly more on apps overall. But Japan's mobile gaming market bucks that trend. In many other parts of the world, Android phone owners will use a forked version of the Android operating system that has a different app store. But the Google Play Store has a wide download base in Japan, according to Lexi Sydow, market insights manager at App Annie. Currently, both Google and Apple take a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases, and Google  will start taking a 15 percent cut of subscriptions in 2018, mirroring Apple's 2016 switch. But as much as that upcoming charge reduction is a boon for developers, it highlights a risk: As quickly as Apple or Google can positively affect developers, they can just as easily change pricing or impose new rules. Think of the downturn Zynga suffered when Facebook made some tweaks in 2012. Sourcing so much of their revenue from two app stores means that these gaming companies are uniquely vulnerable. Because, although these Japanese gaming companies are heavily reliant on Google, the relationship certainly doesn't swing both ways. Alphabet doesn't specifically break out what percentage of its revenue comes from the Play Store — it lumps those revenues together with money from its swelling Cloud business and hardware sales. In Q3 of 2017, Alphabet's so-called ""Other Google revenues"" hit $3.4 billion. That's only 12% of its total revenue. If you tried to slice up how much of that comes from the Play Store, and in particular from Japan, the number wouldn't be consequential.

Jillian D'Onfro,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"It's been a pretty successful year for Alphabet, parent company of Google. The stock is up more than 34 percent this year, and its market cap has swelled to more than $736 billion, according to data from FactSet. Its biggest cash cow is still Google's ads business, by a long shot. But as Google's business grew, so did the number of companies expressing fear of Google. The financial search engine AlphaSense tracks which companies see Google as a threat by scouring the year's earnings, event transcripts, releases and major SEC filings for mentions of the search giant that appear within 15 words of synonyms for competition, risk, threat and similar words. It registered 262 hits this year, up from 236 last year. So, which companies talked fretfully — or fielded anxious queries from investors and analysts — about Google this year? Foremost was the advertising agency WPP, which had nine anxiety-fueled Google references in 2017, up from seven in 2016. Prominently, one of those came during the company's third-quarter earnings when its own presentation asked the question: ""Are Google and Facebook eating our lunch?"" WPP saw pretty flat revenue in Q3 and North American revenue growth declined, though CEO Martin Sorrell has said that low growth is the ""new normal"" and that Google and Facebook aren't actually disrupting the traditional ad agency model. (The fear here is that even though Google and Facebook get the bulk of WPP's ad spend, they also encourage its clients to use their tools directly versus going through an agency middleman.) Criteo, a French ad-tech company, also saw an increase from 4 to 5 Google-related references this year. One question came during a Stifel Technology Conference in June, where an analyst asked about how the company differentiates its products from Google's. Although the two companies have a significant partnership, they also have a competing product. However, Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland said Google tends to go after the ""long-tail"" versus the top markets that his company chases. ""[T]here are certain obstacles as well for Google to be able to develop the type of close relationship we've developed with large retailers,"" answered Fouilland. ""Many of them would be very reluctant to share the type of data they share with us with Google. So that's probably one of the reasons why we don't face Google that much even if they have definitely a competing product."" On the travel-related side of things, Expedia had six Google mentions, according to AlphaSense. In July, Dara Khosrowshahi (then Expedia CEO, now running Uber) called Google an ""existential threat"" to Expedia that was competing for ""the consumers' hearts and minds when they have a travel question"" in  an interview with The Financial Times. As Google has fleshed out its flight and hotel comparison tools, Trivago is feeling the heat, too. ""Google is, from our perspective, the key competitor,"" Axel Hefer, CFO of Trivago, said in response to a question at a Morgan Stanley conference. As Google mimics Trivago's offerings, the company has to keep launching new products and ""[can]not stand still because everything that you do can be copied, obviously, in a certain time period."" Here's the full list of companies expressing fear of Google, according to AlphaSense. ",Google as a threat AlphaSense data 2017
Yoni Blumberg,12282017,CNBC,12212017,"In 2009, executives at Domino's reevaluated their business model in light of an influx of customer complaints, such as ""Worst excuse for pizza I've ever had,"" ""Microwave pizza is far superior,"" and, frequently, ""Domino's tastes like cardboard."" Since 2010, the company's stock has appreciated 2000 percent, reports The Motley Fool, in that time frame outperforming the tech giants Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The Motley Fool's data extends to April 2017, when the value of Domino's stock was $180. Notably, that's lower than it's December value of $185 a share at the time of publication. President and CEO Patrick Doyle turned the chain around so successfully, for one, by heeding the public's criticisms and making better pizza. But, more importantly, he invigorated focus on digital innovation and amped up their delivery service. Domino's now employs more people in their IT department than anywhere else in the company, reports CBS News, and over half of their sales come from digital platforms. ""With Domino's AnyWare, pizza can now be ordered through a variety of platforms, including Google Home, Amazon's Echo, Facebook Messenger, a smart TV, an Apple or Android smartwatch, a connected car, by texting, or by tweeting,"" notes The Motley Fool. They've literally made ordering a pizza as simple as tweeting out a pizza emoji. If that wasn't enough, Domino's also managed to recently land the long-haired ""Stranger Things"" stud Joe Keery as a spokesperson. He's featured in a commercial recreating the running home-scene in the '80s hit ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Only, in this case, Keery isn't trying to beat his parents home. He is trying to beat the pizza he is tracking on his phone, because you can also do that now. Domino's stock has demonstrated consistent growth for years, and Doyle is continuously looking for opportunity to grow further, he told the Los Angeles Times, even if it means taking risks, such as when they added voice ordering to their app three years ago. ""That's the sort of thing that's not going to generate a fast return, but that's part of how you stay ahead of the market,"" he said.

With market caps of $660 billion and $730 billion, respectively, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) possess a level of size and scale that only a handful of businesses in the world can claim. And as they've ascended to dominance, they've earned a fortune for their investors along the way. But which is the better buy today? Let's find out. Microsoft and Alphabet are two of the largest beasts in the public markets. We put them head to head to see which is the best investment from this point forward. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft and Alphabet are both excellent businesses, but let's take a look at some key metrics to see if either one has an edge when it comes to financial strength. Please note that Google reorganized itself as Alphabet in 2015, so we'll use Alphabet's figures from this point forward. Metric Microsoft Alphabet Revenue $92.6 billion $104.6 billion EBITDA $36.2 billion $32.7 billion Operating income $23.3 billion $25.1 billion Net income $22.1 billion $21.0 billion Operating cash flow $40.4 billion $36.2 billion Free cash flow $32.3 billion $24.3 billion Cash $138.5 billion $100.1 billion Debt $85.5 billion $4.0 billion DATA SOURCE: MORNINGSTAR. Few businesses can rival Microsoft's profit and cash flow generation --- but Alphabet is one of them. And while Microsoft's $53 billion in net cash on it balance sheet is the envy of thousands of companies, Alphabet's net cash position checks in at an even more remarkable $96 billion. This gives the search king the edge in terms of financial fortitude. Alphabet is also the clear leader in terms of revenue and profit growth in recent years. GOOGL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Wall Street expects this trend to continue, with analysts forecasting that Alphabet's earnings per share will rise more than 20% annually over the next half-decade, fueled by the continued strong growth of YouTube and mobile search. During this same time, Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to increase by about 10% annually, driven by its cloud and subscription businesses. Thus, Alphabet has the edge here, as well. No better-buy discussion should take place without a look at valuation. Let's check out some key value metrics for Microsoft and Alphabet, including their price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF), price-to-earnings (P/E), and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios. Metric Microsoft Alphabet (Class A Shares) P/FCF 20.47 29.99 Trailing P/E 30.30 35.29 Forward P/E 22.68 25.41 PEG 2.38 1.59 DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE, MORNINGSTAR. On the first three metrics, Microsoft's stock is considerably less expensive than Alphabet's. However, the fourth -- and perhaps most important -- metric paints a different picture. The PEG ratio factors in these companies' expected growth rates. And on this basis, Alphabet's stock is more attractively priced. So I'll split the difference here, and call it a draw for valuation. Microsoft and Alphabet are both outstanding businesses that are likely to continue to reward investors in the years ahead. But with its superior balance-sheet strength and loftier future growth prospects, Alphabet is the better buy today. ","
      
    Better Buy: Microsoft Corporation vs. Google -- The Motley Fool

Natalie Walters,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google gave an inside peek at the hottest tech products of the year in its annual ""Year in Search"" report for 2017. Each year Google makes up its list of most-searched terms by looking at what searches had a high spike in traffic compared to the previous year. The tech company breaks them out into categories, including news, memes, and consumer tech. The list is a valuable look at what people around the world are most interested in learning more about, considering Google is the top search engine in the world. By 2019, Google is expected to take home 80.2% of the search ad market, according to market research firm eMarketer. Here's a closer look at the top 10 searches under the consumer tech category. Apple iPhone 8 was the number one Google search for consumer tech. Image source: Apple. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 and larger iPhone 8 Plus, considered updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, were released in September with a starting price of $699 and $799, respectively. Interest in the phone peaked Sept. 10 through Sept. 16 right around the time when the phone was unveiled at Apple's annual showcasing event on Sept. 12. This phone was highly anticipated because Apple was said to be giving the iPhone its first complete overhaul in design since it came out in 2007. The redesigned 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone ended up being called the iPhone X and was released Nov. 3. The iPhoneX was the second most searched for tech product on Google. Image source: Apple. The iPhone X is the highly anticipated 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone that features an edge-to-edge OLED display and is the first iPhone without a home button. The phone also features facial scanning capabilities, allowing users to open their phone just by looking at it. Interest in the iPhone X also peaked between Sept. 10 and Sept. 16 when Apple held its annual unveiling event. Interest shot up again in early November when the device was first available to buy for a cool starting price of $999. The Nintendo Switch was the third most searched for consumer tech product on Google. Image source: Nintendo. The $299.99 Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch is the seventh home console from the gaming company. The device was unveiled in October 2016 and was released for sale on March 3, 2017. Interest in the device peaked around its release date in early March. The console has been incredibly successful even before the Holiday shopping frenzy. Last week, Nintendo announced that it had sold 10 million units in under nine months. The Samsung Galaxy S8 was the fourth most Google searched consumer tech product. Image source: Samsung. The Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Galaxy S8 was important for the South Korea-based electronics company because it was the first device to come out since the disastrous release of the Galaxy Note 7 that was recalled due to problems with the battery overheating and sometimes exploding. Interest in the Galaxy S8 peaked in late March around the time the design was unveiled at an event in New York City. The device first came out about a month later on April 21 and now retails for $724.99. Samsung's mobile division chief Koh Dong-Jin said at a media conference that the Galaxy S8 outsold its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, by 15% in the same three-month period after launch. The Xbox One X was the fifth most searched for tech product on Google this year. Image source: Xbox. Interest in Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One X gaming console peaked around the time it was released on Nov. 7 -- just in time for the holidays. There are now three versions of the Xbox One, including the standard Xbox One, the Xbox One S, and the Xbox One X. This latest version is Microsoft's most powerful version of the gaming console. In fact, Microsoft claims its 40% more powerful than any other console, which explains its $499.99 price tag. The Nokia 3310 was the sixth most searched for consumer tech product of 2017. Image source: Nokia. The bare bones Nokia (NYSE:NOK) 3310 was announced on Feb. 26 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The nostalgia-inducing phone is an updated version of the original Nokia 3310 that debuted in 2000. The original Nokia 3310 was once lauded for being nearly indestructible and for its long battery life, both of which helped it sell 126 million units. The new Nokia 3310 is made of plastic, has slow data speeds, and limited app options. However, the long-lasting battery is back with up to 22 hours of talk time and 31 days of standby. And the best part is that you can get it for just $60. Interest in this device peaked when it was announced in February and released in the U.K. The phone was first released in the U.S. in late October when it got a 3G update. The first Razer smartphone was the seventh most searched for consumer tech product on Google in 2017. Image source: Razer. The Razer Phone is part of the company's mission to make products ""for gamers, by gamers"" with its focus on sound quality and screen size. Interest in the $699 device peaked in early November when it was announced. The device started shipping soon after on Nov. 17. The Oppo F5 was the eighth most searched for consumer tech product on Google this past year. Image source: Oppo. The Oppo F5 searches on Google peaked in early November when the phone was released in India. The device has previously been released in the Philippines on Oct. 26. The phone features a large 6-inch screen (measure diagonally), as well as facial recognition and a background blurring selfie camera. The features are reminiscent of Apple's new iPhone X. However, the Oppo F5 only costs about a quarter of the $999 iPhoneX. The OnePlus 5 smartphone was the ninth most searched for consumer tech product on Google. Image source: OnePlus. The $479 OnePlus 5 phone received the most Google searches around its June 11 release date. However, even though the phone received positive reviews for its camera and design, the phone was soon replaced with the OnePlus 5T. The updated phone is the same price, but it has smaller bezels, a bigger screen, facial recognition technology, and better cameras. OnePlus was started just four years ago and is known for making premium phones that mimic the giants like Apple and Samsung -- but for a more reasonable price. The Nokia 6 rounded out the list of the top ten consumer tech searches on Google in 2017. Image source: Nokia. The Nokia 6 saw peak interest on Google in early January when it was released. This device is part of a 10-year licensing deal that Finnish start-up HMD made to use Nokia's name on its devices. The phone features a 5.5-inch HD display, a fingerprint scanner and an all-metal body for just $229. ","
      
    Google's Top Tech Product Searches of 2017 -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google are the two biggest forces in digital advertising, particularly in the United States. Combined, they take 83% of the growth in digital ad spending, according Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group. His estimate is actually lower than others', which put Facebook and Google's combined share of digital ad growth closer to 100%. But Wieser calls into question whether the growth in digital advertising is sustainable. After growing 23% year over year in the first half of 2017, digital has easily surpassed TV ad spending in the U.S. Growing at a more modest 15% rate would have digital consuming the entire ad market by 2025, according to Wieser's estimates. There's no doubt Facebook and Google's growth has been fueled by the secular shift in ad budgets to digital. If digital advertising is nearing saturation, investors may be disappointed by the future growth of the companies. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Image source: Facebook. Google and Facebook ads provide the benefit of more precise targeting, which in turn produces higher return on investment for ad buyers. That's why social media and search ads are extremely attractive to direct response marketers (advertisers that are seeking a specific action from people that see the ad, like an app download or a retail purchase). Targeting has enabled both Google and Facebook to attract a huge number of advertisers to their respective platforms, as they can help maximize relatively small ad budgets. Even larger advertisers can get more from Google and Facebook, since they have such a broad reach. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying, ""We have a Super Bowl on mobile every day."" Ultimately, however, total ad spending is limited by consumer spending. At some point, consumers run out of money to spend on the things advertised to them. For free things, like apps, they run out of time in the day (another type of capital) to use them. It's pointless to advertise to consumers that don't have any more money to spend. Therefore, Wieser concludes, growth in ad spending will be closely tied to growth in consumer spending. There's still plenty of opportunity for both Google and Facebook to capture more of the second-largest ad platform: television. Google's YouTube boasts over 1.5 billion logged-in users global (millions more without an account) that spend an average of over 1 hour per day on its mobile app alone. Facebook, meanwhile, recently launched its own YouTube-like platform, Watch. The opportunity is for Google and Facebook to win over television ad dollars. While digital has seen fantastic growth over the past decade, television has been able to largely sustain the amount of ad dollars it brings in. That could change in the future as more people cut the cord and opt to stream more entertainment. Even if Google and Facebook aren't providing that streaming entertainment, they stand to benefit from fewer hours spent watching television. While Google and Facebook may soon face saturation in digital ad spending in the United States, both have significant presences outside of their home country where advertising and consumer spending could grow much faster. Both platforms are practically ubiquitous anywhere outside of China, which means as the digital economies of the world grow, so will the top lines at Facebook and Google. More and more people are gaining internet access every year on top of the fact that the global economy continues to expand. Facebook, for example, generated nearly 10 times the revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada last quarter compared to users in Asia-Pacific. Likewise, Alphabet generated three times the revenue of its operation in Asia-Pacific in the United States alone. Over time, that gap ought to narrow as the U.S. digital ad market saturates but markets in Asia continue to grow relatively quickly. As long as Google and Facebook continue to dominate all over the world, investors don't have much to worry about with regard to their future growth. Both companies have billions of users outside of the United States with a significant runway for monetization growth. ","

Adam Levy,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Our digital lives are dominated by a handful of companies. Among the most dominant are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). All three stocks have posted excellent returns in 2017, and all three are well positioned to continue outpacing the broader market. But if investors had to choose just one of these three stellar companies, which should they choose? Image source: Google. Google controls a massive share of the global internet search market. Google consistently takes over 90% of global search traffic. Those searches not only provide high-value advertising space, but also provide great ad-targeting data for use across Google's portfolio of apps including YouTube, GMail, and Maps -- all of which have over 1 billion users. YouTube, in particular, presents a massive opportunity for Google. The video service boasts over 1.5 billion logged-in users streaming an average of over one hour of video on mobile devices alone. As advertisers look to shift spending from traditional TV to digital media, YouTube presents the best analog to television advertising. The continued growth of YouTube and internet-connected devices in general resulted in Google posting a 21% year-over-year increase in ad revenue last quarter. Average ad prices continue to fall year over year as users spend more time on mobile and more new users come from emerging markets with lower average ad prices. That said, Google showed some signs of stabilization as average ad prices increased sequentially. With so much ad inventory and such great targeting data, Google has become a dominant force in advertising. As digital ad spending overtakes television advertising, Google is a prime beneficiary. The company also continues to take moonshots, mostly under the Alphabet umbrella. Those offer tremendous upside, but their size relative to Google results in minimal negative impact on the operations of the company in the near term. Image source: Facebook. But buyer beware. Facebook is facing an expected slowdown starting in the second half of this year as it bumps up against ad load saturation on its flagship product. Last quarter, Facebook managed just 49% advertising revenue growth. It would be great if all revenue growth slowdowns looked like Facebook's. Facebook is managing to increase average ad prices even as the growth in ad impressions stagnates. It's pushing more into video advertising, and recently launched Watch to compete more directly with YouTube. It's also quickly growing advertising on Instagram as it works to develop a long-term monetization strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook has a few moonshots of its own, including a big investment in virtual reality with its Oculus operations. The company is at the forefront of VR technology, so if it really is the next big computing platform as CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicts, Facebook will play an even bigger role in our lives next decade. Image source: Amazon. Amazon is much more than a retail company these days. In fact, most of its profits stem from its cloud computing services division, Amazon Web Services. One could argue Amazon is more of a services business than a retailer. From cloud computing, to its marketplace, to streaming video and music, Amazon has a plethora of services available to customers. Amazon Prime is the glue that holds nearly all of its services together. Prime is the reason why more than half of all product searches on the internet start on Amazon.com. It's the reason shoppers will opt to buy something from Amazon rather than a competitor, all else being equal (or just close to equal). It's the reason more and more third-party merchants want space in Amazon's warehouses for its Fulfillment by Amazon program. It's the reason Amazon can produce original content, show its movies in theaters, and offer a subscription streaming service in parts of the world where Prime isn't available. There are 90 million U.S. households with a Prime subscription, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Prime's success has led to continual growth for Amazon. Last quarter, sales increased 34%. While Amazon continues to plow cash back into the business, its top-line growth results appear to be paying off. Comparing Alphabet and Facebook is relatively easy, as both companies have similar operations. But Amazon presents a big challenge, as it doesn't really have any peers that can compare. Let's do the easy comparison first. On an EV/EBITDA basis, Alphabet offers a significant discount to Facebook. Shares of Alphabet trade hands at a 19.7 times multiple versus a 23.9 times multiple for Facebook. With similar profit growth outlooks longnterm (considering they each benefit from the exact same secular trends), Alphabet shares appear to be the better buy at this time compared to Facebook. But Amazon may present an even better opportunity. Its valuation is certainly off the charts with an EV/EBITDA ratio more than twice as high as Alphabet's, but it presents significant growth opportunities as it expands Prime into more countries, moves its retail operations into more verticals, and looks for new services to support its own business as well as new customers. Investing in Amazon certainly requires faith in management to execute on an extremely long-term playbook. Investors who just want to maximize their returns on a megatrend in advertising would do well with Alphabet shares. As I said, all three companies present great opportunities. ","
      
    Best Buy: Alphabet, Facebook, or Amazon -- The Motley Fool

Adam Levy,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Over the last few years, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has consistently taken a growing share of online product searches from general internet search engines like Google. Searches for products like ""raincoat"" or ""chromebook"" are immensely valuable to search engines, as they suggest more intent to buy than searches for information. That means the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company can charge more for ads on those searches than others. Over the past year, Google has taken back a good chunk of product searches. Combined with other general search engines, Google took 36% of product searches on the web, up from 28% last year, according to a survey from Survata. Amazon, meanwhile, saw its share fall back below 50% to 49%, down 6 percentage points. Image source: Getty Images. Survata attributes Google's resurgence in product searches to an improved mobile experienced combined with a continued increase in mobile commerce. Shopping and paying for things on mobile is easier than ever with mobile wallets containing both payment and shipping information. Mobile will account for more than half of all online shopping this holiday season, according to an estimate from Adobe. Google is certainly winning in the near term, as it's the default search engine on pretty much every mobile browser. The Google app is also one of the most popular apps installed on smartphones, which means a new search is always just a tap away. Indeed, the Survata survey indicates Google was preferred over Amazon in cases where shoppers were looking for inspiration, not seeking a specific item. That said, Amazon also has a dominant mobile presence, especially among millennials. Millennials go so far as to say Amazon is their must-have app, over social media apps like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat. As millennials' buying power grows, Amazon's hold over them is only going to strengthen its position in search, and Google might reach a plateau on the share of product searches it can win back. Prime has long been considered the biggest reason shoppers head to Amazon when looking to do some online shopping. The sunk cost of the two-day shipping program makes consumers look to get the most out their $99 as possible. But the Survata data shows something different. Only 17% of respondents said Amazon's shipping capabilities impacted their decision to start on Amazon. More common reasons for starting on Amazon include: easy navigation (28%), product selection (27%), and price (25%). The good news for Google and its parent company's investors is that it's capable of competing on all three of those fronts. Scraping more and better data from retailers will provide Google with incomparable ""product selection"" and price data. As I mentioned above, Google has already taken steps to improve the user experience (particularly on mobile) to make its product listings easier to navigate. The bad news for Google is that checking Amazon first is already an entrenched habit for half of consumers. Even as more consumers do more of their shopping online, Google is competing with trying to change habits. Google has been the beneficiary of ingrained habits, maintaining a dominant lead over other search engines, so it knows firsthand how difficult they can be to overcome. Online product searches can be extremely valuable to search engines -- whether they're retailer-specific search engines or general internet search engines. While Amazon's dominance in the category is waning, it's nothing for Amazon investors to get alarmed about. After all, specific product searches on general search engines can often lead to Amazon.com. The bigger opportunity is for Google to continue improving its product search experience on both mobile and desktop. Google can take share of the growing number of consumers that look for inspiration with product searches. Those less-specific product searches could be more valuable to Google, as multiple brands and retailers may be interested in bidding on ad space in the search results. Google's efforts are clearly paying off so far. Watch for further improvements in the future. ","
      
    Google Is Winning Back These Valuable Internet Searches -- The Motley Fool

"Jamal Carnette, CFA",12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Blockchain investors will not forget 2017. Cryptocurrencies, the tokens of the blockchain, have exploded, with the asset class currently worth $600 billion, an increase of more than 3,200% from the $18.3 billion market cap at the start of the year. The second quarter was particularly notable as total funds raised by ICOs (initial coin offerings) surpassed early-stage venture capital funding. By and large, Wall Street has been split on cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Many companies are outright dismissive of cybercurrencies -- most notably JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin investors ""stupid,"" and most do not accept any cryptocurrencies as transactional tender -- but some (including JPMorgan) are investing in the underlying blockchain technology. The two largest companies for cryptocurrency and blockchain investing are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK). A report from CB Insights shows just how active corporations are in the space. Image source: Getty Images. CB Insights notes that corporations have made more than 140 equity investments in blockchain since 2012 with a total investment of $1.2 billion. As of the time of the report, 42 corporate deals had taken been inked. Except for Japanese company SBI Holdings, CB Insights lists Alphabet as the largest corporate blockchain investor with six investments through its Google Ventures arm. Alphabet is more concerned with blockchain than currencies. The company's most notable blockchain investment, Ripple, uses the technology to settle international bank transactions. The company claims it can do so with a one-third reduction in operating costs and allow lenders to move money in seconds. However, since its biggest clients are banks, it's unlikely that cryptocurrencies are the trading currency, but rather blockchain is the technology to help banks transact in fiat currencies. Other investments are in a similar vein to Ripple: Ledger X, the first regulated institutional trading platform, Veem, the online payment provider that uses blockchain to settle international transactions, and Storj, a blockchain-based cloud storage service. Outside of investing in cryptocurrencies, perhaps the best way to invest in the cyber currency craze is Overstock. CEO Patrick Byrne is the most outspoken supporter of bitcoin among major CEOs, noting ""bitcoin is more powerful than physical money."" Additionally, the company was among the first retailers that transacted in bitcoin. More recently, Overstock is creating more of a buzz with its blockchain forays than its online retail operations. Under its Medici Ventures unit, the company has a portfolio of 12 different companies. (This differs from CB Insights count of six investments in total, but the difference appears to be that some of Medici's companies were internally developed.) The most recognized company in Medici Ventures' portfolio is the blockchain-based cybercurrency trading platform, tZERO. This month, Overstock went even further in its cybercurrency plans by launching a $250 million ICO for tokens for the tZERO that would function as preferred equity in the trading site. It's a folly to invest in the companies above to take advantage of the cryptocurrency craze. For Alphabet, 99% of its revenue comes from its Google unit, which is search and ad-related revenue. The other 1%, what Google affectionately calls Other Bets, houses many different businesses in addition to Google Ventures. Additionally, under new CFO Ruth Porat the company has been slowing spending in its Other Bets segment to improve its bottom line. Even though Byrne wants to sell Overstock's retail business to become a true blockchain-focused company, this has not occurred and it will likely be difficult to secure approval from a shareholder majority that invested in an online retailer. In the end, if you've carefully weighed the risks of this new asset class and still want exposure, there are better ways to do so than investing in these two companies. ","
      
    Bitcoin Investing: These 2 Companies Are Investing Millions in Blockchain -- The Motley Fool

Chris Neiger,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. A recent report published by PwC said that artificial intelligence (AI) could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and added that AI is ""[T]he biggest commercial opportunity in today's fast changing economy."" It's predictions like this that make AI a tempting proposition for many investors. But what if AI doesn't live up to these expectations? Investors who want exposure to the artificial intelligence market, but don't want the volatility of AI pure-plays, should look to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both companies are taking big steps into AI right now, but each has the added benefit of being involved in so many different businesses that it's unlikely either one will get burned if AI doesn't quite pan out. Image source: Getty Images. I know Amazon doesn't seem like an artificial intelligence play at first glance, but the company is already knee-deep into it. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told the company's investors in mid-2017 that they should watch the machine learning space because this form of AI technology is transforming how Amazon suggests products on its e-commerce site, and it's how it develops its Alexa virtual assistant for its Echo smart speakers. Bezos said in an investor letter that, ""Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type -- quietly but meaningfully improving core operations."" Aside from using machine learning to improve its internal systems, Amazon is also applying  AI to one of its core businesses, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company recently teamed up with Microsoft to expand its AI offerings for its cloud services in order to fight off rising cloud competition from Google and prove to developers that it can keep pace with Google's cloud-based AI services. Amazon's AWS is currently the leader in the public cloud computing segment, with about 40% market share, and continues to be a key profit generator for the company. AWS should continue to benefit from the implementation of more AI-building services for developers (from image recognition to chatbots) and help Amazon maintain its lead in the cloud computing market. But even if cloud-based AI services fall flat for Amazon, the company's online retail dominance, its current AWS profits, expansion into areas like grocery stores, the Internet of Things, and its Prime services will keep this tech and retail giant humming along nicely. Of course, Alphabet is no stranger to the AI market either. One of the company's most notable forays into artificial intelligence is through its Waymo driverless car company. Waymo's AI software has four million self-driven miles under its belt and its vehicles are now being tested with members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. And just like Amazon, Alphabet is also looking to expand its AI position through its cloud computing services. Alphabet's Google only holds 4% of the public cloud computing market right now, but it's using its machine learning TensorFlow software to woo developers to its Google Cloud services. TensorFlow is a powerful machine learning tool that's used in Google Translate, Gmail, Google Maps, and other apps. Google knows that if it can offer better AI-building software for developers it might be able to convince some of them to eventually switch from Amazon and Microsoft to its own cloud services. Aside from using AI for cloud computing, the company also just announced the second version of its own AI hardware, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). The first version of the TPU chip has been used to provide better results for Google's search services and even to beat the world champion in the ancient game of Go. But the latest version takes the TPU to another level. The new TPUs can handle both deep learning training and inference, allowing companies to tap into powerful artificial intelligence software to solve more complex computing problems and create new algorithms. In short, the AI chip makes Google's cloud prospects even brighter. If all of that weren't enough, Google is also using its AI prowess to better learn what its users are searching for and serve more relevant ads as a result. Alphabet's Google still brings in 88% of the company's total sales, nearly all from advertising, so there's not much of a risk here if AI takes longer to grow than expected. Both Amazon and Alphabet are pushing ahead quickly in AI, but neither of them run the risk of seeing their stock prices collapse if their artificial intelligence pursuits fall flat. Both companies are entrenched in other segments beyond AI that will help keep their revenues coming in. If you're looking for some solid exposure to artificial intelligence, but you don't want to deal with some of the volatility from smaller companies, then Amazon and Alphabet are two great choices for now, and likely for years to come.

    2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Don't Have to Babysit -- The Motley Fool

Eric Volkman,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Most of us, in our investing lives, have more than a few ""should have"" stocks we missed an opportunity to buy at an advantageous price. Even the man who's arguably the most celebrated and successful money man out there -- Berkshire Hathaway founder, CEO, and chairman Warren Buffett -- has a few regrets. Not long ago, Buffett confessed to Berkshire shareholders that he ""missed the boat"" on two stocks that have grown to become monsters on the market. They're also outperformers in many an investor portfolio these days. Image source: The Motley Fool. The two ""coulda, shoulda"" stocks for Buffett and Berkshire are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Alphabet (specifically its anchor asset Google) came to his attention some years ago when Berkshire's Geico insurance unit was a customer of its search engine advertising. ""And any time you're paying somebody $10 or $11 bucks every time somebody just punches a little thing where you've got no cost at all,"" said Buffett, ""that's a good business unless somebody's going to take it away from you."" As for Amazon, the Berkshire leader praised CEO Jeff Bezos' success in dominating two world-beating businesses -- retail sales and cloud services -- ""[f]rom a standing start at zero with competitors with lots of capital and everything else."" At first blush, neither Alphabet nor Amazon is a classic Berkshire play. After all, they're tech-driven enterprises, and for most of its existence Berkshire was famously tech-adverse. But let's dig a bit deeper. Fundamentally, Buffett and his gang have tended to prefer solid, consistently profitable companies that have more or less straightforward business models. Banks, for example, make the bulk of their money pretty much as they always have, by taking in deposits and issuing loans -- Berkshire's portfolio has been heavily weighed in banking and finance for many years. Railroads, also well represented in the asset list, are critical businesses in intercontinental trade with a traditional way of making a buck (transporting goods for money). Beneath all the wonky tech that powers their activities, Alphabet's and Amazon's foundation businesses are not particularly hard to understand. Alphabet's Google sells advertising connected to its search engine. Amazon, meanwhile, sells almost everything known to humankind. On top of that, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the clear No. 1 infrastructure-as-a-service provider on the market. Buffett also likes a company with a moat, the wider the better. A railroad has an intrinsic moat -- even an immensely wealthy would-be rival would have difficulty building a rail network and populating it with engines and cars. Both Alphabet and Amazon have impressive moats. It's safe to say that the great majority of businesses and individuals paying for clicks on Google search haven't even considered opting for any of the site's much lesser rivals. As for Amazon, good luck to anyone trying to match the company's sprawl and reach in e-commerce. Buffett didn't directly say that it was too late for Berkshire to plow money into Alphabet and Amazon, but his ship-has-sailed language made this clear. Both companies have seen notable price appreciation of late, with the twin classes of Alphabet stock more than doubling over the past three years. In that stretch of time, Amazon's shares have risen by almost 280%. Those stocks aren't as cheap as they once were, but they still represent shares of dominant companies that have an excellent chance of staying on top of their respective sectors for many years to come. Warren's not about to buy a stake in either Amazon or Alphabet, but that shouldn't dissuade the rest of us from considering an investment in those world-beating companies. ","
      
    Warren Buffett Regrets Not Buying These Two Stocks -- The Motley Fool

Dan Caplinger,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been one of the best performing stocks of the internet age. After seeing its stock collapse along with most of its peers in the early 2000s when the internet boom briefly turned bust, Amazon set out to broaden its initial scope, going beyond the book market to encompass all things e-retail. At the same time, the company also went in new directions with initiatives that eventually led to the cloud-computing pioneer Amazon Web Services and a host of other business ideas. Amazon's returns have been impressive, but the company has still left income investors in the lurch, because the tech giant has never paid dividends. With other technology companies having fully embraced dividends, some investors think it's time for Amazon to join the crowd. But will 2018 be the right time for the e-commerce company? Let's look more closely at Amazon to see where its business stands and whether a dividend makes sense right now. Image source: Amazon.com. Net Income, Last 12 Months $1.93 billion Free Cash Flow, Last 12 Months $7.22 billion Earnings per Share, Last 12 Months $3.92 Earnings Growth From Full-Year 2016 (20%) Source: Yahoo! Finance. Startups almost never pay dividends, and that's particularly true in the technology industry. With well-established giants in the industry, new companies have to raise as much capital as they possibly can in order to build momentum and take advantage of all the growth opportunities they have in their respective niches. With the cost of capital generally pretty high for start-ups, paying money back to shareholders as dividends would be silly and counterproductive. Yet Amazon is in a far different situation than a start-up. The company has become a cash-generating machine, and its growth in that area has accelerated in recent years. Cash from operations has climbed from $6.84 billion in 2014 to $16.44 billion in 2016. Amazon is also on pace to match that figure in 2017. Net income, meanwhile, has also improved, and Amazon is now consistently profitable after years of being largely ambivalent to its bottom-line performance. AMZN Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YCharts. The natural response to those calling for an Amazon dividend is that the e-commerce giant has had no shortage of productive ways to use the cash it generates. Throughout the past several years, Amazon has worked to improve the health of its balance sheet, paying off more than $4 billion in long-term debt in both 2015 and 2016. Capital expenditures have also played a major role in Amazon's use of available financial resources. Spending has ramped up dramatically so far in 2017, with more than $9 billion in capital expenditures over the past 12 months. Finally, the highest-profile purchase that Amazon made was its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market. The move signaled Amazon's intent to look for ways to merge the brick-and-mortar and e-commerce worlds, with analysts speculating that Amazon could use Whole Foods Market's store locations and distribution network to create synergies with faster delivery options within the grocery space and in other areas. Yet rather than using the cash it had available, Amazon instead turned to the debt market, selling bonds in private offerings rather than tapping into its $24 billion in cash and short-term investments. The best argument against Amazon paying a dividend is that doing anything meaningful would be far too costly for the company. With a share price of nearly $1,200, even getting a 1% yield would take $12 per share in dividends annually. That works out to almost $5.8 billion. CEO Jeff Bezos isn't one to do anything halfway, and so if Amazon can't pay a significant dividend, it's unlikely to pay one at all. Income investors will almost certainly have to wait beyond 2018 before Amazon will reward them for their patience with a cash dividend. ","
      
    Will Amazon Start Paying a Dividend in 2018? -- The Motley Fool

Billy Duberstein,12282017,Fool,12212017,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. On the last earnings call, management also announced another milestone -- its first acquisition -- a 20-person start-up called Adbrain. Financial terms were not disclosed. The addition of AdBrain will not only add to The Trade Desk's capabilities but it also says a lot about the company's people-focused culture and long-term vision for the industry. The Trade Desk bought Adbrain. Why? Image source: Getty Images. Adbrain is a cross-device marketing tech company. The company purchases third-party data and uses its proprietary algorithms to ""map"" a person's identity across all of their devices. Consumers use 3.64 devices per day on average,  but it's difficult for marketers to keep track of the same person on all of these different platforms. Adbrain's algorithms help solve this problem, aiding clients in striking the right balance between having a continuing campaign across a person's devices while not annoying them with irrelevant or too many ads. For instance, if someone clicked on the website for a consumer packaged goods company, Adbrain's technology can then send that person a mobile ad when they're near a grocery store later on.  Adbrain claims it has mapped 90% of the U.S. adult internet population. Adbrain is a small, 20-person company with reportedly minimal revenues, so this was really more of an acqui-hire for The Trade Desk, bringing in Adbrain's algorithms and machine-learning talent. Adbrain had already been integrated into The Trade Desk platform since 2015 but it appears Trade Desk CEO Jeff Greene was so impressed with Adbrain's employees and technology that he wanted to bring them in-house. The Trade Desk likes to think of itself as the advertising version of an electronic stock exchange, matching up buyers and sellers through software and computers. This year, The Trade Desk invested heavily in more ad inventory and customer I.D.'s., giving the company an even more comprehensive data set. Adbrain fits into the next step, which is to apply more algorithms and machine learning to these vast data sets, allowing ad agency customers to craft even more granular strategies at the individual level. Management believes integrating Adbrain's tech directly with The Trade Desk's scale should bolster the combined company more than each company could achieve alone. In addition, Greene has a vision of creating an even more comprehensive offering -- a marketplace in which all of the ad data on the internet is made available to everyone. That somewhat utopian vision may be a stretch for now, since he will have to convince the ""walled gardens,""  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other competitors to sell their proprietary data for others to use, but Greene firmly believes it can and will happen. His theory is that a more efficient marketplace will allow ad buyers to run fewer ads, while publishers, including the ""walled gardens,"" can garner the highest possible rate for each ad spot: ""... [A] walled garden strategy does not work outside of Google and Facebook and, long-term, won't work for anybody,"" he claims. ""We believe no one in advertising, including the walled gardens, have a cross-device identity solution that is sufficiently scaled and sufficiently accurate,"" Greene said of the Adbrain-Trade Desk integration.  That is certainly a bold statement. Greene expects the Adbrain tools to integrate early next year and start showing financial results in the second half of 2018, so counting on increased growth from Adbrain capabilities will require some patience by investors. Still, The Trade Desk is currently profitable (a rarity for new tech IPOs), and the stock has pulled back mightily from its all-time highs. Interested investors should keep an eye on both the integration and the progress on the marketplace initiative into 2018. ","

The loan is “subject to achieving certain product and operational milestones,” Theranos’s founder and chief executive officer, Elizabeth Holmes, told the company’s shareholders in an email Friday evening that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. A spokeswoman for the company didn’t respond to requests for comment. Read: Theranos agrees to 2-year ban on clinical blood work Theranos was once one of Silicon Valley’s best-funded startups, having raised a total of $900 million at a peak valuation of $10 billion, but an investigation by the Journal that raised questions about its technology and practices sent it into a downward spiral. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services banned Ms. Holmes from owning or operating clinical laboratories for two years. In addition, investors and former partners sued Theranos, alleging fraud, and the U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission both launched investigations into the company. Theranos has since settled lawsuits brought by a San Francisco hedge fund and by its former retail partner, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

Commissioner James O’Neill said the New York Police Department analyzed recent attacks in the city, including a truck assault that killed eight in October and the botched suicide bombing in the Port Authority Bus Terminal this month, as well as other attacks worldwide, while planning security for the festivities. There is no specific or credible terrorist threat against the city but NYPD Chief of Counterterrorism James Waters said Islamic State released videos recently showing images of New York City and Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Heavy-weapon squads, bomb-sniffing dogs, and FBI personnel will be stationed throughout the Times Square area, Chief of Patrol Terence Monahan said.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which regulates offshore oil and gas drilling, estimates its proposed changes could save the industry

The proposed rule would relax requirements to stream real-time data on oil-production operations to facilities onshore, where they currently are available to be reviewed by government regulators. It also would strike a provision requiring third-party inspectors of critical equipment—like the blowout preventer that failed in the Deepwater Horizon case—be certified by BSEE. Industry would be getting much of what it asked for, though the agency is proposing leaving in place a standard that governs how much pressure drillers must maintain while drilling a well. It proposes deleting the word “safe” from that section of the rule, though, saying the term was ambiguous and could be used by regulators to go beyond their authority to reject certain permits for drilling. The revisions are one piece of a broad Trump administration effort to loosen regulatory restrictions on business and industry, one with a particularly broad effect in the energy sector. The Interior Department is moving to expand offshore drilling on millions of acres where it previously hasn’t been allowed. The tax overhaul Trump signed Friday includes a provision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production, a goal long sought by oil companies and Republican lawmakers.

But the bank had a change of heart, hours after reports of Lorette Taylor and her brother Louis Paul Herbert’s troubles were published last week. “It was a total surprise,” Taylor said. “Never in my wildest imagination did I think something like this would happen.” After their father died in February, Taylor was tasked with finalizing the details of his will and distributing the inheritances to her sister and brother. Taylor had obtained the bank draft — which is like a certified check, but the money is taken from a customer’s account immediately and held by the bank until the draft is cashed — after TD told her it was the safest way to send the large sum. Herbert, 61, said he went to his local UPS store near Cornwall, Ontario, where he was expecting the bank draft — but it never came. With mounting credit card debts and no source of income, Herbert said, he desperately needed the money to survive. What followed was a 10-month battle among the family, the bank and UPS that caused “unbelievable frustration,” Taylor said. TD had refused to refund the money unless Taylor signed an agreement to pay back the bank if someone cashed the lost draft, which does not expire like regular checks. By last Thursday afternoon, TD and the family reached an agreement — in the form of an indemnity contract that expires in February 2019. “It looks like the matter will be settled,” Taylor said.

The vote — the latest in a series of momentous elections in Europe — will be in line with the overwhelming trends of 2017, featuring a fractured electorate, continued pressure from populist movements and predictions of a struggle to form a cohesive government. But for many European leaders, Italy remains the most worrisome spot in the eurozone, given the huge size of its public sector debt, its weak banks and poor competitiveness. The elections, set for March 4, aren’t likely to put those concerns to rest, as the center-left tries to fend off a populist upstart and the return of Silvio Berlusconi, the 81-year-old whose political rebirth is further shaking up politics. The 5 Star Movement — the anti-establishment group that stormed Italian politics during the crisis on popular anger with legacy politicians — could win about 30% of the vote.
